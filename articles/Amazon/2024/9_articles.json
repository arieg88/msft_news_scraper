        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.\u00a0Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nChris Hyzy, Merrill & Bank of America Private Bank chief investment officer, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that there is \u201c a lot of momentum\u201d behind the market rally. The analyst said that to gauge how much momentum we have behind the optimism, we need to analyze the \u201cwedge\u201d in the market.\n\u201cThe biggest wedge that was in the market last year and in 2022 was inflation. That\u2019s beginning to go away. It\u2019s almost to the fact that no one\u2019s is talking about whether or not we are going to have inflation that\u2019s worrisome.\u201d\nHyzy said that the Fed easing its fiscal policy and now China \u201cjoining the party\u201d will be two key tailwinds for the market.\nAnswering a question about the hard landing vs soft landing debate, the analyst said we should look beyond the two possibilities as he believes there are many other scenarios to consider in between these two outcomes.\n\u201cWe have a lot of components of a soft landing. I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s more of a mid-cycle slowdown with easier financial conditions that should actually create a profit revision to the upside not downside,\u201d Hyzy added.\nFor this article we picked top 10 trending AI stocks on the back of latest news and analyst ratings. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

This marks a staggering growth of around 1,000% year-over-year, as reported by Deidre Bosa, who cited an internal document. Notably, third-party API access is expected to contribute 60% to 75% of this total revenue.\nAmazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0has invested a total of $4 billion in Anthropic, including a $2.75 billion investment made in March. Other backers of the startup include Google and Salesforce.\nCantor Fitzgerlad recently initiated coverage of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with an Overweight rating and said in a broader industry note that despite strong performance, many tech stocks remain attractively valued.\n\u201cDespite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names are fairly reasonable and should benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth and as benefits from widespread cost-cutting fade,\u201d Cantor said.\nAWS\u2019s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon\u2019s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024.

        "Text": "Amazon.com Inc. was founded in 1994 and has become one of the most diversified e-commerce and cloud computing companies in the world. The company's business is categorized into three core segments: online retail, physical stores, and Amazon Web Services.\nAmazon's revenue streams include online stores, physical stores, third-party seller services, subscription services, and AWS. Its online retail platform has everything one could imagine: books, electronics, apparel, appliances, and much more.\nOver the years, it has diversified its business to multiple physical stores including Whole Foods Market, Amazon Books, and Amazon Go. AWS, its cloud computing business, provides a wide range of services to various businesses, startups, and even government agencies.\nPhoto by Bryan Angelo on Unsplash\nAmazon supplies several consumers through its e-retail and physical stores worldwide. AWS generates revenue from a wide range of customers around the world. Amazon's subscription services such as Amazon Prime target consumers who seek convenience and special privileges while using Amazon's services.\nWhile all the above business segments make Amazon a successful business, its bullish thesis lies in its ventures in AI. The company recently acquired Anthropic, a direct competitor of OpenAI, for $4 billion. It already offers its Amazon Bedrock platform to users, giving them access to foundation models which they can build their AI applications on. Bedrock users can now access Anthropic, making it an even more attractive proposition. This should attract more users to the company's platform, giving it a larger user base that it can potentially monetize in the future.\nAmazon already has a massive headstart in AI since it commands a decent market share in the cloud computing market through Amazon Web Services (AWS). By utilizing the AWS resources, Amazon can leverage Anthropic's capabilities to become a major player in AI, if not the leading player.\nThis partnership with Anthropic is still in the early stages and if the partnership takes off, it could result in manifold returns for the company. That $4 billion acquisition price tag will dwarf in comparison to the revenue Amazon can generate with generative AI. This positions Amazon as a leading contender to benefit from AI growth while offering the safety of a stable and strong business, making it a favorite of hedge funds.\nAmazon ranks 1st on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 308 hedge fund portfolios held AMZN at the end of the second quarter which was 302 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks To Invest In According to Billionaires.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other billionaire-approved stocks.\nBillionaires and top hedge fund managers typically dominate the stock market, focusing on leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. They usually don\u2019t waste time with underperformers\u2014they target the market's elite.\nBefore diving into the top stock picks among billionaires, reviewing how the market has performed so far this year is essential. On September 18, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, lowering it to 4.75%\u20135.00% from 5.25%\u20135.50%. This move fueled a market rally, pushing stocks to a new intraday record high, and marking the 39th all-time high of 2024\u2014the first since mid-July. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari acknowledged that while the rate cut was unusual historically, shifting the policy focus from controlling high inflation to addressing a weakening labor market was necessary. Here are some comments:\n\u201cRight now, we still have a strong, healthy labor market. But I want to keep it a strong, healthy labor market, and a lot of the recent inflation data is coming in looking very positive that we\u2019re on our way back to 2%. So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to find anybody at the Federal Reserve who declares mission accomplished, but we are paying attention to what risks are most likely to materialize in the near future.\u201d\nMarket expectations point to an equal probability of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cutting rates by either a quarter- or half-percentage point at its November meeting, with a higher chance of the larger reduction in December. Overall, markets are signaling the Fed\u2019s intent to bring rates to a \"neutral\" level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth.\nFor nearly two years, bulls have dominated Wall Street, driven by a resilient U.S. economy and growing enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI). This momentum has propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to multiple record highs in 2024. Despite the surge, not everyone seems hopeful about the market, with some of the most influential billionaire investors, including Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, signaling caution. Buffett, known for his long-term optimism, has been a net seller of stocks for seven straight quarters.\nOn the other hand, billionaire investor Ray Dalio recently raised concerns about the \"enormous amount of debt\" burdening the U.S. economy. He cautions that neither former President Donald Trump nor Vice President Kamala Harris is likely to focus on addressing debt sustainability in the upcoming presidential election, suggesting that the pressure from the $35.3 trillion national debt will persist, regardless of the election outcome.\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we analyzed Insider Monkey's exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is a tech giant specializing in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and cloud services.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) shares from $225 to $240, maintaining an Outperform rating. This new target is based on a 35x multiple of projected 2026 earnings per share of around $7.00 and a 25x multiple of expected 2026 free cash flow of approximately $100 billion. The tech giant is focusing on monetizing its content through advertising, with CEO Andy Jassy highlighting the ad business, now at a $50 billion revenue run rate, during the Q2 earnings call\u2014second only to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Evercore ISI also estimates Amazon Prime Video (APV) could contribute $1.8 billion to $3.3 billion in operating income by 2025, potentially boosting total 2024 operating income by 3% to 5%.\nAs of the second quarter of 2024, 33 billionaires in Insider Monkey\u2019s database held stakes in Amazon.com Inc.

        "Author": "  Maleha Afzal ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Buy According To George Soros. In this article, we will look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the 10 best growth stocks to buy according to George Soros.\nGeorge Soros, the owner of Soros Fund Management, is known as one of the most controversial investors in the history of investing. The now 94-year-old, \u201cbroke the Bank of England\u201d after he reportedly made $1 billion from shorting the British pound in 1992. As of September 19, Soros has a net worth of $7.2 billion. He managed client money in New York from 1969 to 2011.\nSoros Fund Management was founded in 1970 and manages almost $28 billion in net assets at the moment. The fund is the principal asset manager for Soros\u2019 philanthropic venture, the Open Society Foundations (OSF). So far he has given away more than $32 billion of his fortune to the OSF. Last year, Soros handed over the fund to his eldest son, Alexander Soros, who now aims to take his philanthropic endeavors to another level.\nSoros is known for being ahead of the market. Historically, he has made financial decisions after gauging market feedback and predicting market activities, that have returned or saved him millions, if not billions. This is what he calls the \u201creflexivity\u201d theory. By applying this theory to finance and investments, Soros values assets based on market feedback, predicts market bubbles, and exploits market opportunities. A recent example of this was when Soros pulled out a staggering $73 million from two major technology players right before the tech downturn in mid-July.\nSoros also uses another method, which he calls the Soros\u2019 Method, to forecast events in the financial markets using current data. He then tests his theories on small investments and if the theory seems to be working out, he expands his position or size of his investment. This, however, does not mean that Soros has never failed or encountered risk during his time as an investor. He has made multiple expensive decisions from which he learned lessons and has even quoted them in his books. Here is an excerpt of what he said in his book, Soros on Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve:\n\u201cThe prevailing wisdom is that markets are always right. I take the opposition position. I assume that markets are always wrong. Even if my assumption is occasionally wrong, I use it as a working hypothesis. It does not follow that one should always go against the prevailing trend. On the contrary, most of the time the trend prevails; only occasionally are the errors corrected. It is only on those occasions that one should go against the trend. This line of reasoning leads me to look for the flaw in every investment thesis. \u2026 I am ahead of the curve. I watch out for telltale signs that a trend may be exhausted. Then I disengage from the herd and look for a different investment thesis. Or, if I think the trend has been carried to excess, I may probe going against it. Most of the time we are punished if we go against the trend. Only at an inflection point are we rewarded.\u201d\nOne can say that Soros\u2019 degree in philosophy helped him carve his way into the financial markets. Now that we have studied Soros\u2019 investment philosophy, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 best growth stocks according to George Soros.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best growth stocks according to George Soros, we examined his 13F portfolio and selected his top 10 growth stock picks, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nSoros Fund Management\u2019s Stake Value: $56.21 Million\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services, on the other hand, is used by millions of active customers and has over 130,000 AWS partners across 200 countries.\nThe company was first launched in 1994 and is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. As for its cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS) increased its revenue by 17.2%, year-over-year in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2. AWS has logged 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters, making it a star performer.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also making strides on the AI front. Over the past few months, the company has partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models. As for AI hardware, the company has produced several AI chips to reduce its dependence on other companies.\nAmazon\u2019s growth is undeniable which explains its position in Soros\u2019s portfolio.\u00a0Analysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 16% upside from current levels. Overall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds and\u00a0Fisher Asset Management\u00a0was the largest shareholder.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc.

It's just going backwards.\"\nAnother employee suggested they\u2019d rather be put on the company\u2019s aggressive performance improvement plan than comply with the mandate: \"Can I negotiate my manager to PIP me\u2026 Take my money and leave?\"\nEmployees aren\u2019t just talking about quitting, a small few have already changed their status on LinkedIn to #opentowork as they openly search for more flexible jobs.\n\u201cAmazon has announced 5 day RTO, which is unfortunate because I\u2019m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,\u201d an Amazon Web Services engineer posted on the networking platform.\n\u201cIf you have remote opportunities available, please message me.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy is moving to streamline the world\u2019s largest online retailer and cloud-computing company, cutting management layers and ordering employees to return to the office five days a week beginning in January.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority\nCalifornia\u2019s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough\nNew York City\u2019s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways\nTo Build a Happier City, Design for Density\nPipe Fire Near Houston Forces Residents to Evacuate\nThe shakeup, announced in a memo to employees on Monday, echoed what some company veterans have been whispering for years: It\u2019s become harder to get things done at Amazon. Stories of endless deliberation, unnecessary meetings and layers of approval have become commonplace at a company that fashions itself as a collection of teams charged with operating like startups.\nJassy called out some of those phenomena in his note, citing \u201cpre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings, a longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward, owners of initiatives feeling less like they should make recommendations because the decision will be made elsewhere.\u201d\nEach major organization within Amazon will be required to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% by the end of March 2025, Jassy said. He also announced a bureaucracy tipline for employees to raise concerns about unnecessary processes.\n\u201cWe want to operate like the world\u2019s largest startup,\u201d he said in the message, which was also posted on Amazon\u2019s corporate blog. \u201cThat means having a passion for constantly inventing for customers, strong urgency (for most big opportunities, it\u2019s a race!), high ownership, fast decision-making, scrappiness and frugality, deeply-connected collaboration (you need to be joined at the hip with your teammates when inventing and solving hard problems), and a shared commitment to each other.\u201d\nIt also means an end to Amazon\u2019s relative flexibility on where office workers do their jobs.\nPreviously, Amazon had required employees to badge in at least three days a week, depending on the requirements of their team. Amazon\u2019s new return to office plans will make exceptions for extenuating circumstances or cases where managers had already approved a fully remote position, and employees have a few months to prepare, Jassy said\n\u201cWe understand that some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments,\u201d Jassy wrote.\nMost of Amazon\u2019s roughly 1.5 million employees around the world are hourly employees who retrieve items and ship packages, people for whom remote work was never an option. But the company employs hundreds of thousands of office workers \u2014 it had roughly 350,000 of them on the eve of its largest-ever layoffs, which began in late 2022.\nThe news will likely mean a boost in downtown foot traffic in the cities where Amazon operates. That includes Seattle, where the company is by far the largest corporate tenant; suburban Bellevue, Washington; as well as places like Arlington, Virginia; the San Francisco Bay Area; Austin; Boston; and Nashville.\nThe company\u2019s prior efforts to get workers back in the office were met with resistance by some employees who charged that the company was inflexible and failed to provide data showing in-person work achieved better results.\n\u201cKeeping your culture strong is not a birthright,\u201d Jassy wrote. \u201cYou have to work at it all the time.\u201d\n(Updates with details on Amazon\u2019s workforce, return to office, beginning in the fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nTrump\u2019s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool\nWho Loses in Trump\u2019s Endless Trade War?

        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) closed the most recent trading day at $193.96, moving +0.04% from the previous trading session. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.25% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.56%.\nShares of the online retailer witnessed a gain of 10.47% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Retail-Wholesale sector with its gain of 5.28% and the S&P 500's gain of 1.65%.\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Amazon in its forthcoming earnings report. In that report, analysts expect Amazon to post earnings of $1.14 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 34.12%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $157.05 billion, indicating a 9.76% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $4.74 per share and revenue of $634.49 billion, indicating changes of +63.45% and +10.39%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has remained steady. Amazon is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nFrom a valuation perspective, Amazon is currently exchanging hands at a Forward P/E ratio of 40.87. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 22.89.\nMeanwhile, AMZN's PEG ratio is currently 1.49. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. Internet - Commerce stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.05 based on yesterday's closing prices.\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 55, placing it within the top 22% of over 250 industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

        "Title": "Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "While it can be tempting to bet on flashy, smaller companies, blue chip behemoths like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) might also have a place in your portfolio. The technology conglomerate is far from its days of heady top-line growth, but cost-cutting and new opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI) could still unlock significant shareholder value.\nLet's dig deeper into what the next three years could have in store. \nOnline shopping has been a part of mainstream American life for decades, making it seem a little boring compared to other technology opportunities. That said, Amazon has exploited that market like nobody else for decades. Now, the company's e-commerce business enjoys some exciting trends that could continue to unfold over the coming years.\nSecond-quarter revenue increased by 10% year over year to $148 billion, driven by strong e-commerce sales. Over the last few years, Amazon has dramatically cut costs in its core business -- laying off thousands of redundant workers and streamlining its fulfillment strategy from a national network to a more efficient regionalized model.\nCEO Andy Jassy has also backed away from more risky ventures like \"just walk out\" checkout-free shopping to focus on more tried and true strategies, including self-checkout grocery carts at its brick-and-mortar Whole Foods stores.\nThe reorientation is having a dramatic impact on Amazon's bottom line. The North American e-commerce segment's operating margin jumped 58% year over year to $5.1 billion, while international e-commerce swung from a loss of $895 million to a gain of $273 million. Amazon doesn't break down its profits on a per-country basis. However, some international markets are likely more profitable than others, making this segment a great opportunity for future cost-cutting.\nAmazon's future isn't limited to just cost-cutting in its e-commerce business. The company has additional growth drivers investors can be excited about. Within the Amazon Prime ecosystem, video streaming has arguably evolved from a loss leader to an important value creator.\nAccording to an Evercore survey, 80% of Prime members watch Prime Video. And it isn't hard to see why. The platform is known for popular shows like The Boys and expanded live sports offerings such as select NFL and NBA games. And it represents a good value compared to popular alternatives because it combines video streaming with shopping perks and discounts for a relatively low price of $14.99 per month. It's a unique bundle, offering a distinct value to Amazon's customers. Netflix and Disney+ ad-free plans cost $15.99 and $13.99, respectively, and they don't come with Prime's shopping-related perks.\nInvestors also shouldn't forget about Amazon's foray into generative artificial intelligence (AI) -- a business that helped its cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), grow second-quarter sales by 13% to $9.3 billion and operating income by 38% year over year to $7.2 billion.\nWhile the AI industry is still hugely speculative, Amazon is protected from some of the uncertainty because of its focus on the infrastructure side of the industry with platforms like Bedrock, designed to help clients build customized AI algorithms using Amazon's foundational models.\nThere is a lot to like about Amazon, and the company's valuation is icing on the cake. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 32, shares are slightly more expensive than the Nasdaq-100 average of 29. But this premium looks fair, considering the company's cost-cutting efforts and opportunities for future growth in video streaming and AI. \nOver the next three years, Amazon may enjoy significant bottom-line momentum. And its shares look set to outperform the market.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\nThe latest developments in the AI industry from a business perspective highlight a growing momentum, driven by significant investments, innovative product launches, and both regulatory and market challenges. One notable development is the rise of Safe Superintelligence, a company founded by previous OpenAI bigwig Ilya Sutskever, which recently secured $1 billion in funding to advance AI systems with a focus on safety. This significant capital raise from major venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital underscores the growing concerns around AI safety, as companies work to ensure that AI technologies are both powerful and aligned with human values. Similarly, the market selloff of Wall Street's favorite GPU maker following a stellar earnings report, resulting in a market value loss of close to $280 billion, reflects investor anxieties over the sustainability of AI growth, compounded by concerns over regulatory scrutiny.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nAnother major business development that investors should keep an eye on is the purchase of\u00a0 AirTrunk by investment firm Blackstone for over $16 billion. AirTrunk, a data center operator, significantly boosts the position of the investment titan in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. Data centers are expected to require up to $2 trillion in investment globally over the next five years to meet the demands of AI technologies, and the AirTrunk acquisition signals strong confidence in this growth by top investment managers. Data center expansions are critical as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic roll out enterprise-grade AI services, which demand immense computing power. For example, Anthropic recently launched Claude Enterprise, a robust AI chatbot, that caters to organizations that need advanced features like larger context windows and GitHub integration, aiming to streamline business operations through AI.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

Similar indications have recently been made about Anthropic rival OpenAI, which is also set to raise new funds in a round that would value the startup at over $100 billion. OpenAI is backed by Microsoft. In addition to Amazon, Anthropic is also backed by tech firms like Google and Salesforce.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has appointed Rohit Prasad, one of the chief minds behind the popular Alexa assistant, to spearhead an effort geared towards making the assistant more competitive in the AI space with the AI assistants of Amazon rivals in the tech world, per The Wall Street Journal. The report also claims that Amazon has placed thousands of people in a new team under Prasad to develop AI products for an Alexa upgrade and other businesses.\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news.

As AI technology continues to evolve, the importance it has to large enterprises is underscored by significant investments and impressive returns. For example, the ability of AI to automate and optimize business processes is one of the most significant advantages for large companies. AI-driven automation can streamline supply chain management, optimize logistics, and improve customer service through chatbots and personalized recommendations. According to a report by McKinsey, companies that fully leverage AI could see a 20-25% increase in cash flow\u200b.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic.\nIn financial services, AI is transforming risk management, fraud detection, and customer insights. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, uses AI to review legal documents, a task that used to take thousands of hours of manual work, now accomplished in mere seconds. In the pharmaceutical industry, AI is accelerating drug discovery processes. For instance, companies like Pfizer have used AI to analyze vast datasets to identify potential drug candidates much faster than traditional methods. This not only speeds up the time-to-market for new drugs but also significantly reduces research and development costs, which are estimated to average around $2.6 billion per drug\u200b.\nMoreover, AI is enabling companies to offer more personalized experiences to customers. Retail giants like Amazon and Walmart use AI algorithms to analyze customer behavior and preferences, tailoring recommendations that enhance the shopping experience and increase sales. Amazon\u2019s recommendation engine, powered by AI, is responsible for 35% of the company\u2019s total sales\u200b. NVIDIA, a leader in AI hardware, exemplifies how AI can drive business success. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported $30 billion in revenue, with AI contributing significantly to this figure\u200b.

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) may not be the first stock that comes to mind when the words artificial intelligence (AI) are mentioned. However, Amazon is more exposed to this technological wave than most people realize.\nFurthermore, Amazon is excelling in its AI pursuits, and I think that makes the stock a no-brainer buy right now.\nAmazon and AI are no strangers. AI has already been incorporated across Amazon's commerce business through its online platform, advertising products, and logistics network. However, the latest wave of generative AI is boosting its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nCloud computing providers are massively benefiting from this generative AI trend for a couple of reasons.\nFirst, companies need massive computing power and data storage when they try to create their own AI model. Buying a server dedicated solely to AI modeling isn't in the budget for many companies that want to dabble in this space, so renting it from a cloud computing provider like AWS is a cost-effective way to gain access to cutting-edge hardware.\nSecond, business workloads are still migrating from on-site to the cloud. This is a slow transition and can be very tedious. However, with help from Amazon Q (its AI assistant), this migration is made easier.\nCloud computing is expected to boom over the next five years, with Mordor Intelligence projecting that the overall market will rise from $680 billion in 2024 to $1.44 trillion by 2029. With AWS holding the largest cloud computing market share, it stands to benefit from this transition.\nAI is boosting AWS to new levels, but how does that help Amazon's finances out?\nAlthough Amazon's commerce divisions make up more than 80% of total sales, AWS accounts for 64% of the operating profits. This means that outsized growth in its AWS division will have an even greater effect on Amazon's profits.\nIn Q2, AWS revenue rose 19% year over year, generating an operating profit margin of 36%. That's an impressive business. If it was a stand-alone business, it would gather a premium valuation. However, Amazon already has a fairly premium price point.\nAt 40.2 times forward earnings, Amazon is by no means a cheap stock. This is likely the result of investors being excited about cloud computing and the effect AI will have on it. It also is a recognition that Amazon's commerce businesses could become far more profitable as it focuses on becoming more efficient.\nOver the long term, AWS will be a massive profit contributor and will get a huge boost from all of the new cloud workloads being brought online. This will drive the stock higher, and I think it makes the price tag on the stock worth paying.\nAmazon isn't the first choice for many AI investors, but I think there are compelling enough reasons to purchase the stock now to benefit from the AI wave.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Investing doesn't have to be complicated. Sometimes, it's just about checking a few important boxes. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has checked those boxes for years, and that's primarily why it's one of the best-performing stocks Wall Street has ever seen.\nBut what are those boxes, and does Amazon still have what it takes to make investors money? Let's explore whether Amazon is a buy, sell, or hold today.\nAmazon started as an online bookstore in the late 1990s and has become a one-stop shop for consumers across America. Today, you can buy almost anything from Amazon; roughly 200 million households pay for Amazon's Prime subscription to unlock all of the company's products, services, and perks. Amazon didn't stop there; it began selling its information technology services to customers via Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006, and it's the world's leading cloud platform today.\nAmazon does over $600 billion in annual revenue across its businesses. It dominates U.S. e-commerce with an estimated 38% of the U.S. market. AWS controls 31% of the world's cloud market. Being the largest comes with competitive advantages. For example, its tremendous supply chain and logistics network can deliver more products faster than other e-commerce stores. It can also use its size as leverage with sellers to achieve the lowest prices. It's a similar story in AWS, where companies get more value from Amazon than others, aside from maybe Microsoft's Azure, the next-largest cloud platform with a 25% market share.\nAt this point, Amazon's biggest threat could be U.S. regulators, who may want to break up Amazon's dominance rather than other companies knocking it off its top spot in e-commerce and cloud.\nAll companies mature and slow down eventually, and Amazon is no different. However, the fact that Amazon can still grow revenue at a double-digit rate at its size is remarkable:\nAmazon's growth-oriented culture means the company could keep growing larger. For starters, e-commerce still represents only 16% of total retail spending in the United States. Amazon should benefit if that continues to expand. Meanwhile, the world's shift from on-premise computing to the cloud is ongoing. Experts believe the global cloud services market could grow by 21% annually through 2030, so there is still a lot of opportunity there, too.\nThese are just Amazon's two core businesses. The company has invested in media to grow its advertising business, including securing rights to live sports in the NFL and NBA. The company is also wading into the healthcare field. Amazon has the deep pockets to continue pushing into new categories and is willing to make those efforts.\nSo far, so good, right? Amazon is a juggernaut with the means to grow for years to come, but no stock is worth paying any price for. The good news is that high-quality stocks like Amazon only need a fair price to create fantastic long-term returns. However, Amazon is offering something even better: It's a relative bargain.\nShares trade at a forward P/E of 38, while analysts believe Amazon will grow earnings by an average of 23% annually over the long term. Its PEG ratio of 1.6 indicates a reasonably priced stock for its expected earnings growth. I usually look for PEG ratios around 1.5 or lower if possible.\nSo, what makes the stock a bargain? Amazon is known for aggressively reinvesting profits into the business to grow the company, so earnings don't always tell the whole story. Instead, investors can value the stock against the day-to-day cash flow Amazon's business generates. Using that, the stock is near its lowest ratio in a decade!\nAmazon's stock is reasonably priced or a flat-out deal, depending on how you want to value it.\nGreat investments happen when you can check all the boxes.\nAmazon does that today. The company is as dominant as ever in e-commerce and continues to lead in the cloud. These existing businesses could still grow for years to come. Meanwhile, Amazon is leaning into new opportunities. Lastly, the stock trades at a price that should allow Amazon's wonderful business traits to translate to similarly stellar investment returns over time.\nThat makes the stock a no-brainer buy for any long-term investor.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Some Amazon workers are refusing to \"disagree and commit,\" as one of the company's famed leadership principles requires of those who aren't on board with a decision.\nInstead, hundreds of the online retailing giant's employees are complaining that CEO Andy Jassy's five-days-per-week return-to-office mandate, announced last week, will negatively impact their lives\u2014and productivity at work\u2014and how they hope the company will reverse course.\nThe feedback is from an anonymous survey created by Amazon employees that was viewed by Fortune on Tuesday. Corporate employees have shared it widely via the messaging app Slack, including in one \"remote advocacy\" Slack channel with more than 30,000 members that a former employee created when Amazon first announced a three-day return-to-office mandate last year.\nAs a result, employees who are in favor of remote or hybrid work may have been more likely to respond to the survey and therefore skew the findings.\nAs of the afternoon of September 24, the average satisfaction rating related to the RTO mandate among survey respondents was 1.4 out of scale up to 5 (with 1 meaning \"strongly dissatisfied\" and 5 representing \"strongly satisfied\"). The survey's creators said in an introduction to their questionnaire that they plan to aggregate and share the results by email with Jassy and other company executives \"to provide them with clear insight into the impact of this policy on employees, including the challenges identified and proposed solutions.\"\n\"We are seeking honest, constructive feedback on the recent decision to require a 5-day return to the office schedule,\" the survey introduction reads.\nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\nAmazon has used a hybrid work structure for the past 15 months before Jassy's recent bombshell announcement that most corporate employees would be required to work a full five-day work week from their local Amazon office starting in January.\n\"When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant,\u201d\u00a0Jassy wrote last week. \u201cI\u2019ve previously explained these benefits, but in summary, we\u2019ve observed that it\u2019s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.\u201d\nJassy explanation about the new mandate, and a second one announcing a planned thinning of middle management, came across as tacit acknowledgements of a fraying corporate culture inside Amazon in recent years, as Fortune recently detailed.\nFortune has talked to and messaged with several dozen Amazon corporate employees since last week's announcement, with most opposing Jassy's decision for reasons including reduced productivity during in-office work days and leadership's lack of trust in rank-and-file employees and managers, based on the change in RTO policy. They also complained about the impact the policy will have on single parents and a lack of data explaining the decision from a company whose leaders often talk up data-backed decision-making.\nSome, however, applauded the move in communications with Fortune and argued that using the length or cost of commutes as excuses to avoid five days in the office weekly would have seemed absurd just a few years ago pre-pandemic.\nStill, most respondents opposed the change or cited complications that the new policy will create.\n\"I work with people across many time zones,\" one response read. \"With RTO, they no longer have the flexibility to easily shift hours and collaborate. 3 day had an instant impact here, and 5 day will only be worse.\"\nAs for a solution, the employee suggested \"more realistic work expectations if we're eliminating WFH.\"\n\"Amazon got used to people having an extra 5-10 hours a week to work because we weren't commuting,\" the employee said. \"RTO means that we no longer have the extra time to commit to Amazon and expectations of employees needs to adjust to reflect that. On a similar note, we need to accept that RTO places hard limits on meeting times. I can't hop onto an 8am meeting with the folks in HQ2 or the East Coast anymore. When I was at home, I could jump on early or late meetings pretty easily, but I'm physically unable to do that now.\"\nSeveral respondents focused on the trust, or distrust factor, and the fear, echoed by many employees, that the move will drive out top talent who can easily find work elsewhere, while other groups with fewer options remain.\n\"The people that leave first are the strong engineers you want to work with,\" one wrote. \"Others that can't find new jobs or can't leave due to visa are miserable and quiet quit. Anyone left that actually wants to work has to pick up the slack.\"\nYet another, echoing others, said they believe that the mandate \"ignores the challenge of requiring people to come into an office, but all of their work and every meeting is executed over chime or video conference.\"\nMost of those who chose \"satisfied\" or \"strongly satisfied\" did not leave remarks beyond their rating, or left a negative remark that signaled they may have accidentally selected a positive rating.\nThe bad news for those dissatisfied with the new return-to-the-office rule is that when a group of Amazon employees sent a six-page memo to leadership last year making the case to reverse the original three-day in-office mandate, it was dismissed. With Jassy and team digging in their RTO heels further, it's hard to imagine these results producing any significant change.\nAre you a current or former Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Let's talk about the popular Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company is inching closer to its yearly highs following the recent share price climb. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s examine Amazon.com\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nAmazon.com is currently expensive based on our price multiple model, where we look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. In this instance, we\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock\u2019s cash flows. We find that Amazon.com\u2019s ratio of 44.16x is above its peer average of 17.51x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Multiline Retail industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Amazon.com\u2019s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Amazon.com's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 95%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? AMZN\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question \u2013 is now the right time to sell? If you believe AMZN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on AMZN for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for AMZN, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nDiving deeper into the forecasts for Amazon.com mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

        "Author": " Madison Mills    \u00b7 Host and Reporter",
        "Text": "Amazon Web Services (AMZN) isn't putting all its chips on one AI model. Instead, it aims to win by keeping friends close and potential rivals closer.\nWhile other hyperscalers such as Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) compete on large language models, AWS hopes to offer customers whatever models they want. The cloud giant is positioning itself not just as an artificial intelligence platform to train models but as a marketplace to sell them.\n\"There's not going to be one model that's going rule them all,\" AWS CEO Matt Garman told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference. \"The best model today may not be the best model tomorrow. \u2026 If you have a platform that has a bunch of models available, it's actually relatively easy to take advantage of new ones or add new capabilities from other providers as they come along.\"\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy mentioned this strategy on Amazon\u2019s latest earnings call. Jassy noted that Amazon's Bedrock service has the \"broadest selection of LLMs\" and offers a variety of leading foundational models to AWS customers, who can then build their own AI applications using Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3 models, Meta\u2019s Llama 3 models, and Amazon's Titan models.\nThe latest example of this strategy emerged on Monday when AWS and Oracle announced a partnership despite 15 years of competition between the two cloud providers.\nCooperation, not direct competition, is how AWS plans to diversify its revenue streams and monetize AI. AWS is projecting $105 billion in revenue this year \u2014 about 17% of Amazon\u2019s total revenue, according to estimates.\nWhen asked about the perception that Amazon is falling behind on AI \u2014 particularly when compared to Microsoft \u2014 Garman was quick to mention that for Microsoft, \"it\u2019s not their own technology. \u2026 OpenAI was listed as a competitor of theirs, which is an interesting dynamic for them. ... We like to partner, not necessarily compete.\"\nIn other words, AWS\u2019s perceived sluggishness in AI adoption is a strategic feature, not a bug.\n\"We felt that it was more important to actually build a baseline platform that customers could really go build real enterprise value into their applications on as opposed to rushing in and quickly getting out chatbot technology that ... looks cool and allows people to write haikus,\" Garman said. \"That's not really the eventual place that the value is going to come from this technology.\"\nThat focus on AI infrastructure has helped buoy the stock amid a tech pullback. Year to date, Amazon stock has gained 18%, outperforming the Nasdaq index and other hyperscalers, such as Microsoft and Google.\nAnd AWS is not just offering multiple LLMs to customers \u2014 the company is also offering chips from Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Intel (INTC), as well as their own.\n\u201cIf you talk to customers out there, still, the large majority of usage is on Nvidia chips,\" Garman said. \"They have a great platform \u2026 and they're very popular with customers.\u201d\nThat popularity explains why AWS has yet to talk about competing directly with Nvidia on chips. While Garman would not share details about the usage ratio of Nvidia's chips to AWS's on internal workloads, he agreed it would be beneficial to rely more fully on their in-house chips over time to protect margins.\nMorning brief\n\u201cI don't know that we'll ever be fully reliant on [in-house chips] because I think that the Nvidia team builds some great processors and some great products, and they execute really well.\u201d\nIn his remarks at the conference, Garman walked a fine line between promoting AWS chips while reminding the audience that AWS offers Nvidia GPUs as well, again promoting the idea of customer choice as AWS's key differentiator.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to speak at the Goldman conference on Wednesday morning. Garman quipped that he would have plenty to say about Nvidia's partnership with AWS.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 20 AI News You Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI news you probably missed.\nThe AI industry continues to demonstrate remarkable growth, underpinned by advancements in generative AI, machine learning, and data analytics. Analysts across major research firms and financial institutions remain optimistic about the growth trajectory of AI, predicting sustained expansion through 2025 and beyond. For example, according to Gartner, the AI software market is expected to reach $135 billion by the end of 2025, reflecting a 21% year-over-year growth. This surge is driven largely by the adoption of AI in various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and retail. Research by McKinsey similarly indicates that AI could add as much as $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, making it a critical driver of economic growth.\nA Bloomberg report also echoes these projections, highlighting that venture capital investment in AI startups has continued at a rapid pace, even amid broader economic downturns in technology. In the first half of 2024, over $40 billion in venture capital was funneled into AI-focused firms. Much of this funding targets generative AI, a subfield of AI that has gained attention for its ability to produce human-like text, images, and designs. According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, generative AI could boost global productivity by 7% over the next decade, contributing an additional $4.4 trillion to the global economy. The ability of generative AI to handle complex tasks like legal document drafting and even medical diagnoses has led experts to view it as a game-changer across industries.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a033 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To\u00a0and\u00a020 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nBig Tech CEOs are hyper-focused on AI development right now. Satya Nadella has famously remarked that AI is the defining technology of our time, emphasizing the role of generative AI tools that his company markets, such as Copilot and Azure OpenAI, in revolutionizing work processes and enhancing productivity. Meanwhile, Sundar Pichai has stressed the importance of setting up responsible AI development, remarking that the potential of AI is immense, and noting that it could prove to be more profound for human society than electricity or fire. Andy Jassy has claimed that with cloud cost optimization programs largely in the rearview, companies are now turning their attention to investments in generative AI that is already a multi-billion-dollar business.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a030\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and\u00a010 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI news that has not received significant media coverage but is important to the AI market nonetheless.

Key discussions revolved around energy-efficient computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and advanced semiconductor technologies, signaling critical transformations in tech and telecommunications.

Quizzed about the recent US export controls on chips to China and the rise in geopolitical tensions potentially harming supplies, Huang outlined that his company was confident that if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the Taiwan-based leading supplier of advanced AI chips to NVIDIA, was compromised, the chip supply would continue, even though it would not be as good. Huang stressed that NVIDIA possessed enough intellectual property to transfer chip production from one plant to another, if need be.\nNVIDIA has lost more than 15% of market capitalization since it issued third quarter guidance numbers that raised worries about slowing earnings growth. In particular, there were concerns about the concentration of hyperscalers in the NVIDIA business model, with four large customers representing nearly half of the revenue of the firm in relation to the AI boom. Following the appearance of Huang at the conference, Goldman Sachs semiconductor analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated a Buy rating on the stock, backing the company to pick up sales in the coming months as demand for accelerated computing continued to be really strong and broadened into enterprise and sovereign states.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through the proceedings of the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference.

        "Title": "Amazon warehouse workers are finally getting free $140 Prime memberships, but corporate colleagues aren\u2019t",
        "Author": "  Rachel Ventresca ",
        "Text": "Amazon is delivering a new perk to its warehouse workers\u2014one that\u2019s been a long time coming.\nThe e-commerce giant on Wednesday announced that, in addition to increasing front-line workers\u2019 pay by at least $1.50 an hour, the company will also now offer its Prime membership as a perk starting next year.\nLaunched in 2005 for $79 a year, Amazon Prime has steadily increased its initial offering of free two-day shipping to include streaming and digital benefits, grocery savings, medical care and prescription benefits, and more. Now boasting a user base of over 180 million U.S. shoppers as of March, Amazon Prime\u2019s price has also ballooned to $14.99 per month, or $139 per year.\n\u201cOur front-line team members across our operations are a big part in bringing the magic of Prime to customers, and starting early next year, Prime will become part of their benefits package,\u201d Amazon vice president of worldwide operations Udit Madan wrote in a blog post announcing the new benefits.\nThe free Prime membership, however, is exclusive to front-line workers, the company told Fortune. Corporate employees will still need to shell out the full amount to buy their own subscriptions. However, all employees, both logistics and corporate, will continue to receive 10% off Amazon merchandise, up to a maximum discount of $100 per year.\nEven with the new boost to an average base wage of more than $22 an hour, Amazon warehouse workers\u2019 pay is still far lower than that of their white-collar colleagues. According to ZipRecruiter, the average Amazon corporate employee brings home $133,000 per year, or about $64 an hour.\nAs the No. 2 company on the Fortune 500, Amazon employs more than 1.5 million people and said the new wage increase represents a total investment of more than $2.2 billion in its workforce. When including elected benefits, the new raises bring the average total compensation to $29 an hour, or around $55,000 for a 40-hour workweek.\nThe wage hike and work perks come as Amazon prepares for the busy holiday season and an upcoming Prime Day-like sale on Oct. 8-9. The fall sale is the third savings bonanza of its kind this year, with previous events occurring in spring and summer. During July\u2019s Prime Day event, customers spent a record $14.2 billion, an 11% increase from last year, according to sales tracking data from Adobe Analytics.\nAmazon also made waves this week after CEO Andy Jassy announced plans to order employees back to the office five days per week. Previously, office workers were required to tap into their buildings at least three days per week, depending on their team requirements. The new full-time requirement, however, will make exceptions for extenuating circumstances or for employees whose managers had already approved a fully remote position.\n\u201cWhen we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant,\u201d Jassy wrote in a memo to staff, saying he wants to operate like \u201cthe world\u2019s largest startup.\u201d\nJassy is also planning to reduce layers of management, which have become bloated in recent years due to dramatic hiring increases, according to employees who spoke with Fortune\u2019s Jason Del Rey.\nThe return-to-office plan was not met well by some employees, who slammed the new rules in the company\u2019s internal Slack channel, according to Business Insider.\nOthers took to LinkedIn in pursuit of new gigs.\n\u201cIf you have remote opportunities available, please message me,\u201d an Amazon Web Services engineer wrote. \u201cNothing is off the table. I\u2019d rather go back to school than work in an office again.\u201d\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@fortune/video/7416445710071008555\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this online retailer have returned +7.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 6.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share, indicating a change of +34.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +63.5%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 indicates a change of +23.2% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $157.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $634.49 billion and $702.77 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +10.8% changes, respectively.\nAmazon reported revenues of $147.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.63 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.44%. The EPS surprise was +17.14%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): A Magic Formula Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks For The Rest Of 2024.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other magic formula stocks.\nOne of the best known investment strategies on Wall Street, and one that's also followed by investing greats the like of Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group is value investing. Another fund manager who has delivered fantastic returns through a value based approach is Joel Greenblatt. Greenblatt currently runs the hedge fund Gotham Asset Management, a fund that he set up in 2008 after moving forward from his previous fund called Gotham Capital.\nGreenblatt is among the fund managers that have consistently delivered double digit percentage returns during their career on Wall Street. His previous firm, Gotham Capital, had an amazing run between 1985 and 1994. During this time period, the firm delivered a net return of 34%. This was particularly impressive, as 1985 was the year in which Gotham Capital was founded. On an annualized basis, the fund's returns were even stronger, since during the same period, Greenblatt's fund delivered 50% in returns.\nThe hallmark of a value investing strategy, as you'll understand if you study Warren Buffett's investment strategy in detail, is patience. This also applies to Greenblatt, who typically waits for at least a couple of years after making an investment to reap the returns. But while patience might be a virtue, on Wall Street, it's the returns that matter. On this front, Greenblatt hasn't disappointed, as his fund's blazing run in the 1980s wasn't its only one. After setting up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, the value investor managed multiple funds. Two of these were the Gotham Absolute Return (AR) fund and the Gotham Neutral fund. Among these, the AR fund was set up in 2012, and between then and 2018, its returns sat at 58.6%.\nHowever, while these returns are impressive, this period was filled with ups and downs for the investment vehicle. For instance, 2013 was one of the best years for this fund as it posted 29.82% in returns. These gains were trimmed down to 9.31% in 2014. While these weren't as strong as the previous year's performance, they were nevertheless in the green. This is important since the next year wasn't great by any account, since in 2015, the AR fund ended up with -10.25%. 2016 was somewhat turbulent for American stock markets since the Brexit vote in the UK, slowing Chinese GDP growth, and a commodities slump led to US and global stocks dipping between the end of 2015 and the first half of 2016. Between June 2015 and late February 2016, the blue chip Dow index had lost roughly 9% and the broader NASDAQ had bled a much higher 11%.\nThe next year would see Greenblatt bounce back. In 2016, the fund delivered 7.97% in returns and accelerated its performance later on through posting 10.03% in gains. During these same years, i.e., in 2014, the Gotham Neutral fund's annualized returns had sat at 6.83%.\nSince the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019, the stock market has been operating in a changed environment. The pandemic's immediate aftermath saw major stock indexes crash by 30%+, which then led to the Federal Reserve reducing rates to near zero levels. The subsequent low cost of capital, the boom in demand for consumer technology products, and the rise in retail investing then saw markets soar. During this time period, i.e., the bottom in March 2020 and the peak of December 2021, Greenblatt's AR fund was up by 55% while the flagship S&P index gained 103%. This might make you think that perhaps the investor, who calls his investment approach a 'Magic Formula' had lost its magic.\nBut you'd be wrong. The magic of the Magic Formula was visible during the next phase of the stock market. This was marked by the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate tightening cycle that came in response to soaring inflation. Between December 2021 and October 2023, inflation continued to rise, as the interest rates took their sweet time to make a mark. This meant that the flagship S&P was down by 13.6% from 2021 close to the end of October 2023.\nHowever, during the same period, the AR fund had gained 3.41%. A short strategy had helped Greenblatt, it seems, as the AR fund advertises itself as being 50% to 60% net long. Gotham's pure play long fund, which is 100% long, led the S&P in losses during this time period as it had lost 15.52% during the same period and a stronger 27% from its peak in November start. However, the magic was visible between the March bottom and the November 2021 peak as during this period the 100% long fund had gained 97% to nearly match the flagship index.\nBefore we head to our list of the best Magic Formula Stocks, it's also important to take a brief look at what this investment technique entails. Greenblatt's strategy is based on two metrics, the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. In a simple implementation, stocks are ranked according to these metrics, and the top stocks are bought and held for the long term. A specialty implementation is what Gotham calls its Gotham Yield. According to the fund, this is a proprietary technique that assesses a firm's \"pre-tax cash flow, return on capital, and enterprise value.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy, we ranked the stocks present in Gotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 SEC filings by their dollar value and picked out the most valuable holdings.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 308\nGotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 Stake: $60.8 million\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American eCommerce company that has also diversified its business into the lucrative cloud computing market. Its eCommerce site attracted 3.25 billion users in June, which provides the firm with a sizeable customer base and increases its value to merchants and advertisers. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s cloud business and its tech focused approach have also allowed it to bring its very own AI model under its fold. The firm's partnership with Anthropic has enabled Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to use the Claude AI model. This enables it to build a variety of internal and external AI driven services on a foundational base, meaning that the company does not have to pay fees to others for using AI. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also working on all three layers of the AI stack, from developing its own chips, to building a foundation model and developing AI applications. This could position the firm nicely to benefit from all aspects of AI demand in the future.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s management provided key details for its AI work during the Q2 2024 earnings call:\n\"You can see this philosophy in the primitive building blocks we\u2019re building at all three layers of the Gen AI stack. At the bottom layer, which is for those building generative AI models themselves, the cost to compute for training and inference is critical, especially as models get to scale. We have a deep partnership with NVIDIA and the broadest selection of NVIDIA instances available, but we\u2019ve heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance. It\u2019s why we\u2019ve invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference.\nOverall AMZN ranks 5th on our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

For years he has worked to improve on the Everything Store\u2019s cost structure and operating margins. And on top of operations, the company faces other challenges, from upstart discount retailers to the nagging perception that it\u2019s behind in the AI arms race.\nBut that last hurdle may have already been cleared.\nAnalysts say that Amazon\u2019s cloud business, AWS, has invested heavily enough in catching up to the industry\u2019s first mover, Microsoft (MSFT), that its position may even be advantageous. Amazon\u2019s ability to deploy its own chips within its data centers \u2014 at a fraction of the cost of relying on Nvidia\u2019s \u2014 is the key.\nAmazon, some analysts contend, has a leg up on its competitors on two fronts: first, over Microsoft, which was hit with a rare downgrade earlier this week for leaning too heavily on Nvidia's (NVDA) AI infrastructure. Or as Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson, told Yahoo Finance, \u201cMicrosoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia shareholders.\u201d\nJassy also seems to have an answer to recent grumblings over returns on investment as tech giants dedicate tens of billions of dollars to AI capital expenditures. Amazon expects AI to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business in the years ahead.\nOf course, it\u2019s still too early to say if something like \u201cAI chip sovereignty,\u201d the fancy word for vertical integration, will be a key factor in monetizing AI tools or if unseating Nvidia in the battle over chips will be all that useful. Amazon is taking a more \u201call are welcome\u201d marketplace approach to large language models, offering customers an array of advanced models to choose from instead of peddling a single proprietary offering.\nSome on Wall Street see another short-term advantage over a different rival: Google. Pinched by the potential threat of ChatGPT disrupting a search-based business model, as well as ramped-up antitrust enforcement over search practices, Google carries near-term risks that make Amazon look more attractive.\nAmazon's stock is up close to 30% this year. Among its peers in the \"Magnificent Seven,\" only Nvidia's staggering rise and Meta's (META) turnaround have outperformed.\nThe company is reportedly unveiling a new Alexa with AI as early as next month. Another positive jolt to Amazon's AI story might be the most powerful cultural shift there is.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Amazon.com.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\nAmazon.com already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Amazon.com's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Amazon.com. Our data suggests that Jeffrey Bezos, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 8.8%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.2% by the third-largest shareholder.\nA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\nIt seems insiders own a significant proportion of Amazon.com, Inc.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$214b stake in this US$2.0t business. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. \nWith a 26% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Amazon.com. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.\nUltimately the future is most important. You can access this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): A Bull Case Theory",
        "Author": "  Ricardo Pillai ",
        "Text": "We came across a\u00a0bullish thesis\u00a0on Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) on Kroker Equity Research\u2019s Substack by Kroker Equity Research. In this article we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on AMZN. Amazon.com, Inc. share was trading at $187 as of Sept 12th.\nPixabay/ Public Domain\nAmazon remains a dominant force in the online retail and cloud computing sectors, making it a compelling investment case for the long term. With a strong brand presence and a diverse range of offerings, Amazon goes beyond just being a marketplace; it's a powerful conglomerate spanning cloud services, advertising, logistics, and more. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is its most profitable segment, holding a leading position in the cloud computing market. AWS enjoys 30%+ margins, allowing it to subsidize other parts of Amazon's business. However, increasing competition from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud is gradually reshaping the competitive landscape. Microsoft, with its deep integration into enterprise environments, and Google's focus on AI, machine learning, and data analytics, are steadily gaining market share, creating a more balanced competitive environment. Despite these challenges, AWS remains a key player, and Amazon\u2019s diverse revenue streams support its resilience.\nOne critical area where Amazon falls short is its segment reporting. The company aggregates a vast array of services into broad categories, making it difficult for investors to assess the profitability and risks of its diverse business lines. For example, while the North American segment is more mature and profitable, the International segment still struggles to achieve sustainable profitability. More granular data on Amazon's revenue by product category would provide a clearer picture of its growth drivers and segment profitability.\nAmazon Prime is another significant contributor to the company\u2019s success, evolving from a free-shipping program to a comprehensive subscription service with over 200 million global members. The program enhances customer loyalty and drives higher spending among subscribers, contributing to Amazon's overall growth. The growth of Amazon\u2019s Subscription and Advertising Services is notable, both nearing an annual run rate of $100 billion. Meanwhile, physical stores, including Whole Foods Market, remain the smallest and slowest-growing revenue stream.\nAmazon is highly focused on cash flow, with its latest earnings report revealing a trailing twelve-month cash flow from operations exceeding $100 billion and free cash flow approaching $50 billion. Despite significant capital investments in logistics and cloud infrastructure, Amazon has reached a scale where free cash flow continues to grow. This financial strength positions Amazon well for future shareholder returns, even though it currently prioritizes growth and strategic investments over dividends and share buybacks.\nValuing Amazon is complex due to its diverse and rapidly expanding businesses. Despite these challenges, Amazon's strong financial position and growth potential make it an attractive option for long-term investors. With its forward valuation multiples near their lows over the past three years, Amazon appears to be fairly valued, and its continued growth in free cash flow and earnings per share supports a bullish outlook for the stock.\nAmazon.com, Inc. is on our list of the\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 308 hedge fund portfolios held AMZN at the end of the second quarter which was 302 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a010 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\nDisclosure: None.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Retail Dive newsletter. \nRecommended Reading \nAmazon debuts all-new Echo Spot ahead of Prime Day\nTo streamline its e-commerce operations for sellers and shoppers, Amazon made a number of updates to its Buy with Prime and Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment services, the e-commerce giant announced Wednesday at its Accelerate seller conference.\nShoppers using Amazon\u2019s Buy with Prime feature can now pay via PayPal. Next year, the e-commerce platform will allow Prime members to connect their PayPal account to their Prime account, so they can access fast, free shipping while shopping with Buy with Prime on participating merchants\u2019 sites.\nStarting this month sellers can also show estimated delivery dates on their Google Shopping ads, Google search results and TikTok ads, per the press release. \nWith its new ad and payment features, Amazon continues to build upon its Buy with Prime capabilities. \nIn January 2023, the company expanded its Buy with Prime service to all U.S. merchants, enabling Prime subscribers to buy items from other websites with their saved checkout details and receive free delivery and returns. Later that year, the company partnered with Shopify and added order tracking and live chat\u00a0for Buy with Prime customers.\u00a0\nBuy with Prime orders through merchants\u2019 websites are up over 45% year over year, according to Amazon, and the number of merchants offering Buy with Prime is up over 25%.\u00a0\nAlongside its Buy with Prime improvements, Amazon has also bolstered Multi-Channel Fulfillment, which serves over 200,000 U.S. merchants, according to the company. Last fall, the company integrated ReturnGo, a returns management company, into its Multi-Channel Fulfillment service, allowing merchants to automate their reverse logistics.\n\u201cBuy with Prime and Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment continue to help sellers attract new shoppers with the convenient, fast, and predictable experience they expect from Amazon,\u201d Peter Larsen, vice president of Buy with Prime and Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment, said in a statement. \u201cBoth services have seen significant growth over the last year, and we\u2019re delighted to add to the momentum and partner with PayPal, Google, TikTok Ads, and Shopify to give brands even more options to grow their businesses.\u201d\nAmid its efforts to bolster the shopping and seller experience, the company is gearing up for its upcoming sale event next month. The retailer is hosting its Prime Big Deal Days on Oct. 8 and Oct. 9 for its Prime members in 19 countries, during which it will offer discounts on items such as electronics, toys and apparel.\n"

        "Text": "Amazon.com (NasdaqGS:AMZN) is currently experiencing significant growth, with a notable 11% increase in revenue year-over-year and a 91% rise in operating income. However, the company faces challenges such as high costs and competitive pressures. In the discussion that follows, we will explore Amazon's core strengths, financial weaknesses, growth opportunities, and potential threats to provide a comprehensive overview of its current business situation.\nClick here and access our complete analysis report to understand the dynamics of Amazon.com.\nAmazon continues to demonstrate impressive revenue growth, reporting $148 billion in revenue, up 11% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, as highlighted by CEO Andy Jassy. This growth is further supported by a significant increase in operating income, which rose by 91% year-over-year to $14.7 billion. Additionally, Amazon's free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases soared by 664% to $51.4 billion, indicating strong financial health. The company's AWS segment remains a key driver, with revenue growth accelerating from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2. Furthermore, Amazon's advertising revenue added over $2 billion year-over-year, generating more than $50 billion in the trailing 12 months. Prime member engagement also continues to rise, with members increasing their shopping frequency and spending more on Amazon. These strengths are reflected in Amazon's valuation, with the company trading at $191.16, which is below the estimated fair value of $332.64, indicating it may be undervalued despite its high Price-To-Earnings Ratio compared to industry averages.\nAmazon faces several financial challenges, including high costs and retail margin pressure. CFO Brian Olsavsky noted an uptick in expenses and investment in Q2 compared to Q1, which impacted segment operating margins, decreasing by 20 basis points sequentially. The company is also experiencing lower average selling prices (ASPs) as customers trade down on price, reflecting cautious consumer spending. Despite these challenges, Amazon's Price-To-Earnings Ratio (45.2x) remains high compared to the Global Multiline Retail industry average (19.8x) and the peer average (31.5x), indicating that the stock is expensive relative to its peers. Additionally, Amazon's Return on Equity (ROE) is forecasted to be low at 17.1% in three years, which is below the benchmark for high returns. These weaknesses highlight areas where Amazon needs to improve its cost management and pricing strategies to enhance profitability.\nAmazon has several growth opportunities, particularly in AI and cloud services. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized the dramatic growth in the company's AI business, with a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate. The expansion into pharmacy services also presents a significant growth avenue, with Amazon optimistic about its potential. Project Kuiper, which aims to ship production satellites late this year, is another promising venture that could become a large business for Amazon. Additionally, the company sees further opportunities in advertising growth and customer experience enhancements, such as introducing free restaurant delivery for Prime members. These strategic initiatives can enhance Amazon's market position and capitalize on emerging opportunities, driving long-term growth and competitive advantage.\nTo gain deeper insights into Amazon.com's historical performance, explore our detailed analysis of past performance.\nAmazon faces several external threats, including intense competition, economic factors, and regulatory risks. The company's AWS segment, despite being a leader in cloud services, continues to face competition from other major players in the industry. Economic factors, such as cautious consumer spending, pose a risk to Amazon's revenue growth, as noted by CFO Brian Olsavsky. Regulatory risks are also a concern, with ongoing scrutiny and potential legal challenges that could impact Amazon's operations. Furthermore, market risks related to macroeconomic factors and consumer behavior could affect the company's performance. These threats highlight the need for Amazon to navigate competitive pressures and regulatory environments carefully to sustain its growth trajectory.\nTo dive deeper into how Amazon.com's valuation metrics are shaping its market position, check out our detailed analysis of Amazon.com's Valuation.\nAmazon's strong revenue growth, significant increase in operating income, and soaring free cash flow highlight its solid financial foundation, suggesting potential for sustained success. However, challenges such as high costs, retail margin pressure, and cautious consumer spending indicate areas where Amazon must refine its cost management and pricing strategies to enhance profitability. The company's strategic initiatives in AI, cloud services, pharmacy services, and Project Kuiper present substantial growth opportunities that could further strengthen its market position. Despite facing intense competition, economic factors, and regulatory risks, Amazon's current trading price of $191.16, which is below its estimated fair value of $332.64, suggests that the market may not fully recognize its growth potential and financial health. These factors collectively indicate a promising outlook for Amazon, provided it navigates its challenges effectively.\nHave a stake in Amazon.com?

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Don\u2019t Miss Out: Jim Cramer\u2019s 10 Key Stocks to Watch.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Jim Cramer's other key stocks to watch.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer traveled to Dreamforce, to understand the true capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and to separate fact from hype. After diving deep into the topic, he feels more equipped to identify which AI claims are genuine and which are simply marketing fluff. He noted that there seems to be far more misleading information than real advancements.\n\"All right, I had to come all the way out here to Dreamforce, the Salesforce Tech Festival, to learn what artificial intelligence is really capable of and what\u2019s pure hype. After immersing myself in AI, I feel a lot more confident in sorting out the real from the phony. And you know what? There\u2019s a hell of a lot more phony than there is real. That\u2019s why I want to show you which AI claims are meaningless and which ones are legit.\"\nJim Cramer stated that today's market movements show it's possible to navigate unpredictable conditions. He emphasized that we don't need expert predictions to see that interest rates are likely to decrease, which is essential for maintaining a bull market. He advised against overthinking the situation and suggested focusing on profitable opportunities, particularly the growing importance of artificial intelligence.\n\"Today is proof that you can game the ungameable. But you don\u2019t need a San Francisco weatherman to know which way the wind blows. In the end, we know rates are headed lower, not higher, and that\u2019s what we need to sustain this bull market. Please do not overthink it. I\u2019d rather focus on what can help us make some money, like the biggest theme in the world right now: artificial intelligence.\"\nCramer pointed out that while AI is generating excitement in the stock market, its impact on the broader economy has been limited. There are some practical applications, like cost savings in corporate back offices, but nothing particularly groundbreaking. This is why many analysts are starting to label the hype around AI as a bubble.\n\"Specifically, what does AI actually do? We\u2019ve heard so much about this technology and how it\u2019s going to revolutionize everything. Right now, though, we know that while AI has taken the stock market by storm, it really hasn\u2019t taken the actual economy by storm. There are use cases, sure, back office corporate cost savings\u2014nothing flashy. That\u2019s why so many commentators now come on air and call the whole thing a bubble.\"\nJim Cramer explained that AI, especially when combined with advanced computing from chipmakers, significantly speeds up processes and enables machines to act intelligently, similar to capable humans. He noted that businesses aim to create quality products for consumers, but a shortage of workers has become a major issue, particularly highlighted during the COVID pandemic. This has led to sales associates being too busy to engage effectively with customers, resulting in rushed and confusing interactions.\n\"Let me tell you what AI really does. When coupled with accelerated computing, AI makes everything go faster. It rationalizes processes and can make machines behave like smart, good humans. Business wants to produce good products and sell them to real people, whether for enterprises or homes\u2014that\u2019s capitalism 101. But right now, we don't have enough workers to do it.\nCramer pointed out that companies are pushing their employees hard to boost profits, which can create a stressful environment. However, after attending Marc Benioff's keynote, he recognized the potential of a technology called Agent Force. This AI initiative can engage with customers politely, and efficiently answering common questions by using personalized data.\nCramer argued that AI is an ideal solution for customer service, as it can provide clear and friendly assistance without the frustrations that often come from human employees who are overwhelmed and eager to leave. AI agents can listen, reason, and either direct customers appropriately or handle their inquiries on their own.\n\"Companies are already squeezing as much as they can out of their employees to boost stock prices and profits for executives. Then it hit me while watching Marc Benioff's incredible keynote today. He described an initiative called Agent Force, and I realized what this technology can really do. It has time for you, acknowledges you, and is polite. It can almost always answer your questions because there are only so many that get asked regularly, and it has the data to respond your data. It knows your preferences.\nJim Cramer explained that AI offers a better experience than what we currently have. For instance, in retail, AI knows customer preferences, helps with returns, and suggests alternatives based on previous purchases, reducing the need to deal with human salespeople who might be stressed or impatient. If customers are still unhappy, they can opt to talk to a human, but they might prefer the friendly interaction with the AI agent.\n\"So, what AI really is and what it does is provide us with something better than what we currently have. It\u2019s a retailer that knows all about your preferences, can help you return an item, and asks if you want something different from what you bought last time. It frees you from the hassle of a human salesperson who might be frustrated or upset. And if you\u2019re not satisfied, you can still speak to a human if you want to\u2014but I doubt you will, because the AI agent is just so much more pleasant.\"\nCramer added that AI's potential extends beyond retail. He believes that in ten years, we might wonder why we relied on doctors when AI agents could provide kinder, more empathetic care. These AI systems could analyze millions of test results, quickly identifying serious health issues like melanoma, heart disease, or kidney cancer, making it easier to spot dangerous patterns before they become serious problems. AI's ability to compile and analyze data effectively is key to this advancement.\n\"It\u2019s not just retail. In ten years, I think we\u2019ll wonder why we ever wasted a doctor\u2019s time when AI agents were so much better, kinder, and more empathetic. Doctors could analyze millions of test results that might have taken a decade to sort through, identifying dangerous patterns well before they become problematic\u2014like melanoma, heart disease, or kidney cancer. It\u2019s all in the data, and only AI can compile it in an accessible way.\"\nAdditionally, Jim Cramer pointed out that self-driving cars are becoming more common and are significantly safer than human drivers since they don't get distracted or impaired. He noted that AI can also handle tasks like proofreading and correcting errors without making mistakes. This efficiency allows law firms to operate with fewer associates.\n\"We see self-driving cars everywhere. They\u2019re much safer than human drivers. They don\u2019t drink and drive\u2014they don\u2019t even drink. An AI agent can proofread, correct, and never make a mistake. Law firms can now hire half as many associates because of this efficiency\"\nFinally, Cramer emphasized that AI agents often perform better than humans in most situations. For repetitive tasks, he believes it's preferable to interact with a courteous and efficient AI rather than a stressed or frustrated human who may not want to engage.\n\"The bottom line is that if you let the AI agent do its job, it will outperform humans in the vast majority of cases. And for repetitive tasks, trust me: you\u2019d much rather have a polite and friendly AI agent than a harried, angry, or exhausted human who really doesn\u2019t want to deal with you.\"\nOur Methodology\nThis article summarizes Jim Cramer's latest Morning Thoughts, highlighting ten key stocks he reviewed. We ranked them by hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) reported impressive revenues of $134.4 billion for Q2 2023, largely driven by its strong performance in e-commerce and AWS (Amazon Web Services), which alone generated $22.1 billion.\nAWS continues to thrive despite rising competition, reflecting solid demand for cloud solutions.

Dan Niles, Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager, during an interview with CNBC last month, called the decline in Mag. 7 stocks after Q2 earnings representative of a \u201cfundamental shift\u201d in the industry.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s popular to talk about AI because these stocks are driving the market, but at a certain point, you want to get a return on all of this money you are investing.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. employees will soon have to schlep to the office all week, but they might have fewer boring meetings when they get there.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nEric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes\nWaiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development\nExclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million\nUnlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad\nNY\u2019s MTA Warns Against Borrowing More Than $13 Billion\nChief Executive Officer Andy Jassy\u2019s memo targeting corporate bloat promised a purge of \u201cpre-meetings for the pre-meetings for the decision meetings,\u201d which he deemed \u201cartifacts that we\u2019d like to change.\u201d In doing so, the technology giant that employs 1.5 million people became the latest big company to try to reduce corporate bureaucracy, a scourge of the workplace that became more pronounced during a pandemic-induced hiring binge.\nLarge organizations waste an estimated $100 million a year on needless gatherings. Executives have said that nearly half of those meetings could disappear without any negative impact.\nJassy pledged changes that would flatten the organization, saying he wanted employees \u201cfeeling like they can move fast without unnecessary processes, meetings, mechanisms, and layers that create overhead and waste valuable time.\u201d\nSome workplace experts cheered Jassy\u2019s attack on red tape, which also included a promised reduction in management layers and the creation of a \u201cbureaucracy mailbox\u201d where staff can identify processes and rules that \u201cshould be called out and extinguished.\u201d\nOther management gurus said there can be value in the pre-meetings that Jassy wants to cull.\n\u201cI think pre-meetings have upsides and downsides,\u201d said Andy Molinsky, a professor of management and organizational behavior at the Brandeis International Business School. While they eat up time and can be exclusionary, they also help shape and vet ideas, which can increase buy-in and ultimately improve execution, Molinsky said.\n\u201cPerhaps Amazon feels things have just gotten too bogged down. The question is whether what they gain outweighs what they might potentially lose,\u201d he said.\nOrganizational psychologist Steven Rogelberg, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, said pre-meetings can be \u201ca critical part\u201d of some decisions. Even if many are unnecessary, a top-down edict to eliminate them all is misguided, he said.\nCultural red flag\nStill, a calendar chock full of pre-meetings is a cultural red flag, a sign that employees fear the repercussions of not having all the answers, according to Jennifer Nahrgang, a management professor at the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa.\nTactics for limiting meetings vary: Twice a quarter, for example, Salesforce-owned Slack cancels all internal meetings for an entire week, and eliminates them on Fridays. Shopify Inc. created a tool embedded in employees\u2019 calendars that estimates the cost of each meeting. They can add up: A decade ago, Bain & Co. found that a single weekly meeting of mid-level managers cost one organization $15 million a year.\nCutting bureaucracy could add $4.8 trillion to US economic output, according to a new analysis by Gary Hamel and Michele Zanini, the authors of Humanocracy and co-founders of the Management Lab, a research and advisory firm. But initiatives to reduce bureaucracy often fail.\n\u201cEvery few years a company will go to war with bureaucracy. But like grass in the rain, it grows back, and all you\u2019ve done is given it a trim,\u201d Hamel said. \u201cLike aging, this creeping bureau-sclerosis is inevitable.\u201d\n\u201cWorld\u2019s largest startup\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s drive to get leaner follows that of Meta Platforms Inc., where CEO Mark Zuckerberg last year cut thousands of jobs and reportedly railed against \u201cmanagers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work.\u201d Bayer AG chief Bill Anderson has taken a unique approach \u2014 modeled in part on Chinese appliance maker Haier \u2014 by grouping staffers into small teams that work together for 90 days on a project, then disperse, in a model called \u201cdynamic shared ownership.\u201d\nIn Amazon\u2019s case, Jassy said he wants to foster a cultural transformation so the 30-year-old company will \u201coperate like the world\u2019s largest startup.\u201d\nBut Hamel noted other CEOs have made similar promises, only to fall flat: Carly Fiorina, upon taking control of Hewlett-Packard in 1999, said she would recapture the spirit of the Palo Alto garage where the company was founded. Six years, a failed merger and thousands of layoffs later, Fiorina was dramatically ousted by HP\u2019s board.\nWill the new guard of storied tech startups be any more successful at rescuing their entrepreneurial roots from red tape? According to Hamel, that depends on how they approach the problem.\n\u201cBureaucracy is not just excess layers, it\u2019s a way of thinking,\u201d Hamel said. \u201cThere\u2019s great merit in asking if there are too many pointless meetings. But if you really want to recapture the spirit of a startup, that\u2019s a much more radical goal. So my first question for Amazon is, \u2018How much are you really willing to change?\u2019\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside Activision and Blizzard\u2019s Corporate Warcraft\nThis Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "Author": "  Greg Bensinger ",
        "Text": "By Greg Bensinger\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com announced on Thursday a new artificial intelligence application that it says will help its independent sellers with sales metrics, inventory maintenance and product advertising, among other things.\nThe move is part of a broader Big Tech effort to employ the technology for greater automation.\nThe software, dubbed Amelia, can provide instantaneous answers to broad questions such as how to prepare for the holidays and how a seller\u2019s business is performing, including units sold and website traffic.\nLater, the company says, the software will be able to help resolve problems of sellers such as delayed shipments without additional human intervention.\nIn a demonstration of the software for Reuters, Amazon showed how Amelia can quickly call up metrics for a seller, such as sales data. It also made suggestions for preparing for major sales holidays, including promotions and buying advertising on Amazon.com.\nAmelia is meant to give sellers \u201ctheir own personalized expert in selling on Amazon,\u201d said Dharmesh Mehta, vice president of worldwide selling partner services at Amazon. \u201cIt needs to be a deep expert in all these kind of core parts of running your selling business.\u201d\nAmazon, which relies on third-parties to supply more than three out of every five units it sells, has had an at-times testy relationship with sellers, particularly over fees.\nBy automating some of the seller customer service, Amazon may be able to more inexpensively handle complaints and other difficulties that would otherwise require human intervention.\nThe Seattle retailer announced Amelia during its annual conference in its hometown where many of its roughly 450,000 U.S. independent sellers converge for tips and tricks, and to learn about new products and services.\nAmelia follows the announcement earlier this year of Rufus, a generative AI search engine Amazon added to its website to help customers find more products. Amazon has since started selling advertising within Rufus, suggesting it may let marketers pay in exchange for the software\u2019s recommendation.\nIt has also rolled out a corporate chatbot and is working to improve its Alexa voice assistant by updating it with a more conversational AI.\nAmazon boosted capital expenditure in this year\u2019s second quarter to about $16.5 billion from $14 billion in the first quarter, driven in large part by AI investments.\nSince the release in late 2022 of ChatGPT, Silicon Valley has seen an investing frenzy over generative AI which can create full sentence responses to prompts or create lifelike images or sounds.\nBut generative AI software can invent answers, known as hallucinations, when it lacks sufficient training data. Mehta said Amelia could hallucinate and such occasions would be addressed depending on the severity of the mistake.\nHe said Amazon had no plans to offer ads within Amelia. The service will not be made available in its current form to large brands such as Unilever, who also sell on Amazon, he said.\nAmazon said Amelia will initially be available only to a small subset of sellers and only in English before nearly all U.S. sellers gain access over the next month.\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n"

        "Author": "  Sarah Perez ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) sellers now have access to an AI assistant designed to help grow their business by answering questions about their metrics, and later, helping to resolve issues that arise. The assistant, code-named Project Amelia and built on AWS's Amazon Bedrock, is available in beta to U.S. sellers, starting Thursday.\nThe retail giant says select U.S. sellers will gain access immediately, followed by a broader rollout across the U.S. Later this year, the feature will begin to arrive in more countries and in other languages besides English.\nThe goal with Project Amelia, explains Amazon, is to offer sellers tools that can then manage and grow their business.\nAt launch, sellers will be able to retrieve information like sales data and customer traffic information, and be able to ask the assistant questions like \"How is my business doing?\" In response, the AI will offer a summary of metrics, including recent sales, units sold, and website traffic, comparing those metrics to the same time last year.\nSellers will also be able to ask follow-up questions, like those focused on a single product's sale, growth, and customer traffic, among other things.\nLater, the AI assistant will be able to help resolve issues and aid with other tasks.\nFor example, Amazon sellers will be able to ask something like \"I have 300 units on the way and don\u2019t see that reflected in the report. Can someone look into this?\" and they'll receive personalized guidance. If needed, they may also be connected with Amazon's support team to help them investigate the issue further, which makes the assistant sound more like a traditional chatbot, in that case.\nFurther down the road, Project Amelia will be able to offer sellers \"additional help managing the task\" or may even \"offer to solve the problem on a seller\u2019s behalf,\" Amazon says, without providing specifics or a time frame to launch.\n\"We are always seeking to equip our selling partners with the most effective tools and capabilities, empowering them to more easily start and grow a successful business,\" reads a blog post, penned by Mary Beth Westmoreland, VP of Amazon's Worldwide Selling Partner Experience. \"By leveraging the transformative power of generative AI, we are creating and deploying technologies that will improve how sellers can manage and grow their businesses. Innovative solutions like Project Amelia are reducing the time, effort, and resources required from sellers to manage their business, allowing them more time for building great products and delighting customers,\" she adds.\nAmelia's launch follows the launch of another AI chatbot aimed at consumers, Rufus, which went live in the U.S. this summer. On the consumer side, Amazon is also leveraging AI to help customers find clothes that fit and to enhance product reviews, among other things. For sellers, Amazon had previously introduced generative AI tools to help them create product listings, and for those who advertise on Amazon, tools to generate backgrounds using AI.\nOn Thursday, Amazon also shared how it was using generative AI to improve its product recommendations for consumers as well as its product descriptions.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/amazon-debuts-an-ai-assistant-for-sellers-project-amelia/\n"

It was the first time the working mom, who has been with Amazon for over four years, learned she would need to add another four hours to her weekly commute.\n\u201cAt first, I didn't quite believe it,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cAfter all, who expects to get career-altering news from a news article instead of your employer.\u201d\n\u201cWhich, to be honest, is a pretty horrible way to find out about something that's going to impact your life in a huge way. I really, really would have liked a personal communication from my manager, but that didn't happen for a couple of days.\u201d\nLaura says she was hired virtually during the pandemic with the understanding that there was no expectation to return to Amazon\u2019s offices.\nThat was, until 2023 when CEO Andy Jassy announced that he wanted workers to \u201cgo back to being in the office together the majority of the time\u201d\u2014at least, three days per week.\n\u201cThe original RTO mandate was a tough pill to swallow, but the latest one is impossible,\u201d she says.\nAfter the initial shock of the news blew over, Laura says a sense of calm and clarity washed over: \u201cMy months of struggling to make three days a week are over, and I know that my time at Amazon has to end.\u201d\nEven if she could commit to commuting into the office full time, Laura says she would still quit over Amazon\u2019s remote work bait and switch.\n\u201cHonestly, I've lost so much trust in Amazon leadership at this point,\u201d she adds. \u201cI've been updating my resume and portfolio, and rage applying to new jobs on LinkedIn.\u201d\nLaura\u2019s not alone: A handful of Amazon employees told Fortune that they\u2019re so frustrated with the tech giant\u2019s war on working from home that they\u2019re officially on the job hunt.\nTwo say they learned the news\u2014and its implications\u2014via the media, rather than a manager.\nOne says they\u2019ve already handed their notice in. Another says they\u2019ve had two interview offers within 48 hours of the RTO announcement.\nAmazon did not respond to\u00a0Fortune\u2019s\u00a0request for comment.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy has repeatedly warned remote workers that it\u2019s \u201cnot going to work out\u201d for them at the company.\nDespite this, it\u2019s clear that a number of Amazon employees (and managers, for that matter) have been ignoring the guidelines up until now.\nExperts previously told Fortune that Amazon\u2019s 5-day mandate is a \u201cnegotiation game\u201d to get employees in the office for the 3 days it originally asked for.\n\u201cI was not complying,\u201d Ben, who lives three hours away from an Amazon office, comments on the previous hybrid policy.\nHe briefly considered moving before thinking again: \u201cI decided not to make life choices as Amazon can fire me at will anyway, and I do not want to make long-term life changes because some manager decided I should start going to the office when I was hired virtual and promised I could work from wherever I want.\u201d\nSome managers were still assuring their new hires could work from home after the 3-day mandate came into effect.\nOne employee told Fortune that he was hired remotely in May 2023\u2014a month after the company announced its initial RTO policy.\n\u201cI left a decent company I live near to go to Amazon since it was working from home,\u201d Luca, a millennial analyst, complains. \u201cFor me, it's not that I don't want to go in the office, there is no office close to me.\u201d\u00a0\nHe says that his manager has been covering for his absence from any office, but that will no longer work.\n\u201cHe told me he would not be able to help, they\u2019ve made him go into an office too,\u201d Luca says, adding that he couldn\u2019t get a firm answer on whether he will be expected to head into the office despite being promised otherwise in the interview room.\n\u201cI like my job at Amazon, but I need firm ground to stand on and they are not providing that.\u201d\nWhether Jassy\u2019s latest move is to make employees show their faces more frequently or not, workers have until Jan. 2, 2025 (the date he\u2019s given them to relocate if needed) to call his bluff\u2014or quit.\nMost of the people Fortune spoke to think that Amazon is secretly hoping for the latter anyway.\nWhile Jassy positioned Amazon's changes\u2014which also include a flattened hierarchy and no more hot desking\u2014as a better way to work, disgruntled employees are adamant that it's a thinly veiled headcount reduction.\n\u201cIt's a rob Peter to pay Paul situation of short-term gains from voluntary layoffs in exchange for losing top talent and reducing productivity for years to come,\u201d Gen X program manager Jared says.\nAlthough he\u2019s only been working at Amazon for six months, he\u2019s already changed his LinkedIn status to #opentowork, reached out to former colleagues, and updated his resume in the hopes of finding a more flexible job before Jan. 2.\n\u201cThe new policy is less flexible than pre-COVID and does not respect the needs of employees to take care of their health, their family, or work-life balance,\u201d Jared scoffs. \u201cI will not go back.\u201d\nWhile he was complying with the three-day policy, he refused to return to working in a cubicle five days a week when Amazon\u2019s competitors are still offering some working from home\u2014and he thinks many others will do the same.\n\u201cAs a top performer with prior MAANG (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) experience in this tight market, I believe it will be fairly easy to find a new role that is at least hybrid,\u201d Jared adds.\n\u201cOne of my co-workers put in his notice on Monday. I expect others to follow.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not wrong. Rumors of a stricter RTO were enough ammunition to inspire Ben to quit\u2014he took \u201cvoluntary termination\u201d two months ago and has now started his own firm.\nLikewise, Lisa, a marketing leader in Europe, has called time on her four years at Amazon. After hearing about Jassy\u2019s announcement via the news, the 40-something says she immediately started reaching out to recruiters.\n\u201cThis new mandate goes against so many of the leadership principles that we supposedly hold so dear,\u201d she says, adding that she has been a \u201ctop-rated employee year on year\u201d thanks to working from home.\n\u201cI\u2019ve constantly delivered for this business and their reward is to order me back into the office, where I will sit at my desk either writing docs or sitting on calls,\u201d Lisa adds. \u201cI don\u2019t want to work for a business that clearly has so little respect for me.\u201d\nEvery job that Lisa has applied for offers hybrid work, and she\u2019s confident she\u2019ll find a more flexible employer before the New Year.\nWithin 48 hours of Amazon\u2019s new policy going public, she had already secured two job interviews.\n\u201cI will always work hard, but now I want to work for a company that works hard for me too.\u201d\nInterviewee names have been changed for anonymity.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) won partial dismissal of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit accusing it of maintaining illegal monopolies, though the details of the ruling by a federal court in Seattle on Monday were not immediately clear.\nThe FTC has accused the online retailer of using anti-competitive tactics to maintain dominance among online superstores and marketplaces. Amazon asked U.S. District Judge John Chun to dismiss the case in December, saying the FTC had raised no evidence of harm to consumers.\nLast year, the FTC alleged Amazon.com, which has 1 billion items in its online superstore, was using an algorithm that pushed up prices U.S. households paid by more than $1 billion. Amazon has said in court papers it stopped using the program in 2019.\nChun issued a sealed ruling, partially granting Amazon's motion. The FTC will be allowed to continue to pursue any claims the judge did not permanently dismiss, court records showed.\nChun also ruled the case will be tried in two parts, rejecting Amazon's bid to have the FTC present evidence of the alleged violations and its proposed remedies in the same trial.\nA spokesperson for the FTC declined to comment on the order. An Amazon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn its complaint last year, the FTC claimed Amazon hampers competition, in part by pushing sellers to use its advertising and fulfillment services.\nAmazon argued in its motion to dismiss the case that its price-matching and Prime shipping services benefit consumers and are examples of its efforts to compete with thousands of online and brick-and-mortar retailers.\nThe case is one of five blockbuster lawsuits where antitrust regulators at the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice are going after Big Tech.\nFacebook owner Meta Platforms (META) and Apple (AAPL) are both being sued, and Alphabet's (GOOG) Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge recently found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.\nThe Amazon.com case is an important one for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has long pushed to challenge the power of the huge online retailer. In 2017, Khan wrote an influential academic article arguing the company's structure and practices posed anticompetitive concerns and had escaped antitrust scrutiny.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Tom Hogue and sonali Paul)\n"

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other big name stocks.\nIn early April 2024, Goldman Sachs Inc.\u2019s data revealed that short selling on individual US-listed stocks was at the highest level in 6 months, and the most targeted sectors were technology, telecom, and media. This increase in short positions was seen after the significant ~9% advance seen in 1Q 2024 for the S&P 500. As per the data, some hedge funds that were using long-short equity strategies have started to fight the rally.\nDuring extreme market volatility, short selling has become pronounced and has drawn significant interest from institutional and retail investors. It has prompted regulatory intervention as new reporting requirements have been issued by the SEC to offer transparency and ensure the availability of short position data.\nIn the 2Q 2024, the US and Canadian markets saw an increase of\u00a0~$58 billion in short interest or a rise of 5.1% from the previous quarter.\nRecently, S3 Partners, a renowned tracker of short-interest data, reported that the sectors that saw the largest increases in short exposure in 2Q 2024 included information technology (a rise of $49.3 billion), communication services (at $11.2 billion), and utilities (a rise of $3.7 billion) from the previous quarter. The sectors that saw the largest decrease in short exposure were the energy and financial sectors, down $12.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.\nEarlier in 2024, a significant surge in\u00a0the leading AI giant\u00a0resulted in losses of\u00a0~$3 billion for the short sellers. Some market experts even described this as an \u201cAI-generated nightmare.\u201d\nIn global equities, short interest climbed during July 2024, with strong increases seen throughout the Automobile (+13bps), REITs (+11bps), and Consumer Durables (+11bps) sectors, reported S&P Global. On the other hand, the largest decreases were in the Financial Services (-10bps) and Real Estate Management and Development (-4bps) sectors.\nTalking about the US equities, the average short interest decreased to 77 basis points during July 2024. Significant increases in short interest were seen throughout REITs (+6 basis points) and the Household and Personal Products (+8 basis points) sectors. Conversely, the largest declines were in the Financial Services (-15 basis points) and the Automobile (-9 basis points) sectors.\nS3 Partners revealed that there is a relatively weak correlation between short positions in certain assets and distress measures. This means that not all heavily shorted stocks are facing difficulties. As per the firm, broader market sentiments and valuation concerns are some of the factors that can drive short interest.\nThe company believes that shorting an asset can form part of broader strategies or hedging activities not linked to distress. It mentioned that there can be 3 measures of bearishness for stocks \u2014- average analyst ratings (From 1 to 5), Credit default swap (CDS) spreads,\u00a0and Altman Z-Score.\nFor example, the US Dollar had a low short position of ~1.32%. However, it had a high CDS spread of 1000 basis points. This indicates high perceived distress on the currency even though there is minimal short interest. This can be because of factors such as currency market dynamics or investor sentiments.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 20 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss.\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market continues to show tremendous growth, with significant advances across sectors. According to a report by McKinsey on the AI industry, the AI revolution is driving innovation across industries, with investment in AI increasing sevenfold in recent years despite economic downturns in other tech sectors. This surge is primarily fueled by the growing demand for AI applications in data analysis, content generation, and predictive modeling. In particular, generative AI has drawn the most attention, revolutionizing industries like marketing, customer service, and product design\u200b. Moreover, high-performing companies are heavily investing in AI to gain a competitive edge. These firms, often referred to as AI high performers, allocate a significant portion of their digital budgets \u2013 over 20% \u2013 to AI technologies. They prioritize AI not only for cost reductions but also for new revenue streams.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a033 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To\u00a0and\u00a020 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThe market for AI applications is set to expand even further, with several industry reports predicting that by 2030, AI could contribute up to $13 trillion to the global economy. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Moreover, the bank expects established businesses around the world to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years\nProminent businesses have taken note of these developments. Latest reports suggest that investment titan BlackRock, in partnership with tech giants is likely to launch a more than $30 billion fund focused on AI. The fund will invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects. The need for energy is a source of particular interest to the business community as AI models require substantial computational power, leading to higher energy consumption.\nThe sheer scale of computational power required for AI workloads has also forced tech giants to build supercomputer clusters, stringing together expensive chips, cooling systems, networking tools, and other high-tech gear to crunch data. These AI data centers will likely consume a growing amount of energy as the use cases of AI expand. McKinsey estimates that by 2025, 15% to 20% of all data center workloads will be AI-driven, compared to less than 5% in 2020. Furthermore, according to a report from the International Energy Agency, AI data centers could account for as much as 13% of global electricity demand by 2030 if current growth trends continue. Tech giants are thus investing billions of dollars into expanding their AI infrastructure.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores in North America and internationally. Latest reports suggest that the e-commerce giant is slowly rolling out an artificial intelligence tool designed to help third-party sellers quickly resolve issues with their accounts and fetch sales and inventory data. In an announcement made last week, the company detailed that it was launching the new product, named Amelia, for select US sellers. Amelia is the latest addition to a series of generative AI tools launched by Amazon in the past year, like an AI-powered shopping assistant named Rufus and a chatbot for businesses dubbed Q.\nEvercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney recently raised the price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock to $240 from $225 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares. In a research note, the analyst noted that Amazon had ramped up its content on Prime Video with more NFL games, 66 regular season NBA games in 2025 and the 2024 PPA World Championships and monetizing that content via advertising had become a higher priority. Evercore estimated that APV would generate between $3 billion and $5.9 billion in total revenue for the tech giant in 2025, implying 3% to 9% incrementality to the FY24 Amazon ad revenue estimate of $56 billion.\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is launching an artificially intelligent assistant designed to help online merchants manage their businesses.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nEric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes\nUnlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad\nWaiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development\nNY\u2019s MTA Warns Against Borrowing More Than $13 Billion\nBelfast\u2019s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland\u2019s Public Transport\nCodenamed Project Amelia, the new tool will answer a range of questions, from how to prepare for the holiday shopping season to suggesting the wording of product listings, Amazon said Thursday during its annual Accelerate conference for merchants.\nAmazon has been rolling out various AI tools amid intensifying competition with Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Open AI. One is a workplace chatbot called Amazon Q that helps corporate customers search for information, write code and review business metrics. Rufus lets consumers comparison shop and research products on Amazon\u2019s web store.\nFor the merchants, who account for most of the sales on Amazon retail sites, the company has introduced software designed to help them optimize product listings and create or modify images. On Thursday, Amazon said it would also give them tools to create product videos.\nAmelia is available in beta for a subset of merchants and will be rolled out to all US sellers \u201cover roughly the next month,\u201d Dharmesh Mehta, an Amazon vice president who oversees seller services, said in an interview. Later this year, Amazon will start introducing Amelia to other countries and making it available in languages besides English.\nThe assistant is built atop Bedrock, a software platform designed to make it easier to access other companies\u2019 large language models, as well as Amazon\u2019s own. Mehta said Amelia had relied on a variety of different models through its development. He didn\u2019t specify which ones power it today.\nMehta conceded that sellers weren\u2019t clamoring for an AI chatbot specifically, but that Amazon thinks the tool can help simplify selling online. \u201cThe thing we hear from sellers regularly is, \u2018Hey Amazon, I\u2019ve got to do a lot of things, figure out a lot of stuff to be successful and I want to be an expert in these because it really drives my business,\u2019\u201d he said.\nIn a video presentation at the conference, Mehta demonstrated Amelia surfacing bullet points about a seller\u2019s product line and offering recommendations. Over time, Amelia will provide a more personalized experience and become better at anticipating merchants\u2019 needs, he said. It will also grow more capable of taking action on a seller\u2019s behalf.\nAmazon long ago began automating elements of the relationship with millions of third-party sellers, some of whom say they\u2019re at the mercy of algorithms that can suspend their accounts unfairly. In the video, Amazon demonstrated a seller asking a question about a product shipment that hadn\u2019t shown up in Amazon\u2019s records. If the software can\u2019t find the answer, it can connect sellers with Amazon\u2019s support teams.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPalantir\u2019s CEO and Wall Street Annoy Each Other Straight to the Bank\nFive Reasons to Be Optimistic About the Entertainment Business\nThreats to Local US Election Officials Are Rising, and More Workers Are Quitting\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool\nIn Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Daniel Sparks, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "On the surface, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock may look expensive. Shares trade at 41 times earnings. But a look beneath the hood shows a number of reasons why the stock easily lives up to its premium valuation.\nHere are some of the main reasons investors may want to consider adding shares of the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant to their portfolio today if they don't already own it.\nSure, Amazon's $1.8 trillion market capitalization might seem overwhelming to some investors looking into the stock. But the company's underlying cash flow helps justify this valuation. For instance, the company's trailing-12-month operating cash flow came in at an astounding $108 billion. This huge cash-flow stream enables enormous reinvestment in its business while still producing substantial free cash flow. Total trailing-12-month free cash flow, less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations, was $53 billion.\nAmazon's price-to-adjusted free-cash-flow multiple of 34 is much easier to embrace than its price-to-earnings multiple of 41.\nStill, even a price-to-adjusted free-cash-flow multiple of 34 may seem a bit pricey for a company that grew its total revenue by only 10% year over year in its most recent quarter. But an overview of Amazon stock is incomplete without understanding how important its cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is to the company. Coming in at 16% of trailing-12-month sales, some investors may make the mistake of concluding the segment is of small importance to Amazon's overall business. But this couldn't be further from the truth.\nFirst, investors should note that AWS is growing faster than Amazon's overall business. This means it will grow as a percentage of revenue over time. Consider that AWS revenue rose nearly 19% year over year in the second quarter.\nSecond, AWS is far more profitable than the rest of Amazon's business. AWS's operating income in Q2, for instance, was $9.3 billion. This gives the segment an operating margin of greater than 35%. Even more, this segment accounted for about 63% of total operating income. This means that as AWS grows, it will have an outsize impact on Amazon's profitability.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy emphasized the importance of AWS in the company's most recent earnings call, noting that none of the progress it is making in cloud computing is especially noteworthy.\u00a0\"AWS continues to be customers' top choice,\" Jassy said in the company's second-quarter earnings release.\nOf course, it's no surprise that AWS remains a top customer choice. The company's market leadership in cloud computing gives it scale and cost advantages, helping it reinvest aggressively and innovate rapidly.\nAmazon's scale in cloud computing is difficult to overstate. Synergy Research Group estimates that AWS commands nearly a third of the worldwide cloud infrastructure market share, with Microsoft's Azure coming in second -- about six percentage points behind.\nOnce investors realize the significance of AWS as a growth engine for Amazon, fundamentals start to justify the stock's current valuation.\nThe final key factor helping the bull case for Amazon stock in a big way is the company's competitive advantage: scale. As both the world's largest e-commerce retailer and cloud-computing infrastructure provider, the company's overall scale is a competitive advantage in and of itself.\nPut another way, the company is able to spread its fixed costs across a larger number of customers than its peers, spinning its flywheel faster so it can invest more aggressively than its competitors and expand its economic moat even further.\nConsidering Amazon's significant cash flow, its fast-growing and lucrative cloud-computing business, and its scale competitive advantage, shares look like a good buy today. Of course, there's always a chance that the company's edge in retail and cloud computing will erode over time and that Amazon's future isn't as bright as expected. But this risk seems small, given the company's long history of growing rapidly, expanding profitability, and maintaining market share leadership.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Buy for Long Term.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks.\nOn September 23, Chris Watling, Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate easing path and the impact it may have on the market.\nAccording to Walting, the market is deeply divided on not two but three different sides. While some analysts and investors foresee a recession, others believe the economy is going towards a soft landing, and of those a small minority believe that the economy may accelerate at a rapid pace. Walting also added that while predicting the appropriate terminal rate is interesting, there is a lot more going on with the economy. Comparing economic conditions to the 2008 recession, households and corporations are in much better shape, hinting that a recession may not be the most likely outcome.\nHe believes that the economy may be slowing right now but it may experience faster reacceleration than before without the need for further falls. His advice to investors is to judge the economy based on multiple data points. As for the appropriate portfolio, Walting suggests that bonds are overcooked and gold must be given a pause. At the moment, the market is rotating away from tech into defensive sectors, and in the future, it may rotate more towards cyclical stocks.\nAs the S&P 500 recorded an upside following the Fed's easing cycle, investors and analysts alike eye a soft landing for the economy. On September 26, Liz Miller, Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the future of markets.\nMiller states that the pivot has been great for the financial markets and now that the Fed is thinking about growth, investors are hopeful of a soft landing. She suggests that stocks in sectors such as housing, rental, finance, and consumer goods may benefit immensely from the easing interest rate cycle.\nMiller suggests that the S&P 500 is not the best way to measure the performance of financial markets, given that it is skewed to the mega-cap tech stocks. Looking at other indices, other sectors have not made highs since December 2021. She believes the market may be flat but there is huge potential for upsides. Miller shares concerns over the Chinese economy and how it influences the global outlook. She suggests that for the global economy to balance, companies must work to regain consumer confidence in China.\nNow that we have studied the appropriate portfolio mix for investors following the Fed's decision, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nTo come up with the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term we examined promising stocks hedge funds are piling into. These are blue chip stocks with wide moats and have long track records of driving shareholder returns. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services, on the other hand, is used by millions of active customers and has over 130,000 AWS partners across 200 countries.\nThe company is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. As for its cloud segment, AWS has logged 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters, making it a star performer.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also making strides on the AI front. Over the past few months, the company has partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models. As for AI hardware, the company has produced several AI chips to reduce its dependence on other companies. Speaking of AI, AWS is now housing the next generation of Llama models from Meta, giving customers more choices to build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications. The new models are capable of visual reasoning, document processing, and multilingual translation.\nAmazon\u2019s growth is undeniable which explains its position on our list. Analysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 17% upside from current levels. Overall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds and Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder, according to the Insider Monkey database.\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon\u2019s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.\"\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "By Jody Godoy\n(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc won partial dismissal of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit accusing it of maintaining illegal monopolies, though the details of the ruling by a federal court in Seattle on Monday were not immediately clear.\nThe FTC has accused the online retailer of using anti-competitive tactics to maintain dominance among online superstores and marketplaces. Amazon asked U.S. District Judge John Chun to dismiss the case in December, saying the FTC had raised no evidence of harm to consumers.\nLast year, the FTC alleged Amazon.com, which has 1 billion items in its online superstore, was using an algorithm that pushed up prices U.S. households paid by more than $1 billion. Amazon has said in court papers it stopped using the program in 2019.\nChun issued a sealed ruling, partially granting Amazon's motion. The FTC will be allowed to continue to pursue any claims the judge did not permanently dismiss, court records showed.\nChun also ruled the case will be tried in two parts, rejecting Amazon's bid to have the FTC present evidence of the alleged violations and its proposed remedies in the same trial.\nA spokesperson for the FTC declined to comment on the order. An Amazon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn its complaint last year, the FTC claimed Amazon hampers competition, in part by pushing sellers to use its advertising and fulfillment services. Amazon argued in its motion to dismiss the case that its price-matching and Prime shipping services benefit consumers and are examples of its efforts to compete with thousands of online and brick-and-mortar retailers.The case is one of five blockbuster lawsuits where antitrust regulators at the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice are going after Big Tech.Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Apple are both being sued, and Alphabet's Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge recently found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.\nThe Amazon.com case is an important one for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has long pushed to challenge the power of the huge online retailer. In 2017, Khan wrote an influential academic article arguing the company's structure and practices posed anticompetitive concerns and had escaped antitrust scrutiny.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Tom Hogue and sonali Paul)\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Invest In According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other blue chip stocks.\nWhile economic data may be scarce, every data point gives a new angle to the ever-uncertain economic conditions in the US. On September 12, Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Asset Allocation, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the market moves after the consumer price index (CPI) report was released on Wednesday.\nDraho suggested how regular intra-day moves did not hold enough weight to impact or influence the Fed\u2019s decision. However, he did acknowledge that the inflation data and Wall Street\u2019s reaction to it make the case for a 25-basis cut, or more, in the upcoming Fed meeting.\nDraho then hinted that investors are hoping for a soft landing and are looking for stronger reasons or economic cues to hold back, given that bad economic news, as of now, has not triggered investors as much. He also emphasized the need for more financial data and clarity on whether the Fed would be proactive with its rate cuts for further analysis.\nContrary to what investors wish, he believes the Fed will be rather hawkish than proactive with its rate-cutting cycle. He adds that while the market calls for 100 basis points in rate cuts by the end of this year, he does expect the Fed to signal way less.\nHe then shed light on supply challenges in the technology sector, hinting that demand is not the issue at the moment. He was particularly impressed by the earnings posted by AI companies. Draho expects tech companies to have strong balance sheets and strong earnings power by the end of 2024, making them attractive stocks despite the economic turmoil.\nOn September 13, Andrew Krei, Crescent Grove Advisors co-chief investment officer, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his bullish outlook on the economy and financial markets. Krei discussed the labor market trends and how they may impact the Fed\u2019s decisions in the upcoming meeting.\nKrei pressed that despite the \u201cunwarranted\u201d volatility over the past few weeks, the economic outlook remains favorable, with credit markets showing close to no signs of stress. Krei also shed light on the global economic backdrop, suggesting that international markets, especially Europe, Japan, and China were showing strong signs of recovery in trade and manufacturing.\nAs far as investment goes, Krei suggests that while mega-cap tech stocks have shown promising results, he is more bullish on stocks outside of the magnificent 7. He was particularly inclined to companies in healthcare, finance, and industrials, hinting that these sectors will benefit immensely from the easing cycle. He then suggested that investors must shift their focus to diversified stocks with lower valuations and relatively stronger risk-adjusted returns.\nWhatever the state of the economy, some stocks are notorious for their strong and consistent financial results.\nPhoto by Bryan Angelo on Unsplash\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 12 best blue chip stocks to invest in according to short sellers, we first went over multiple similar rankings, our own rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of blue chip stocks. We then found the companies with the lowest short float and ranked the top 12 with the largest number of hedge fund holders and lowest short float percentage. The stocks are sorted in descending order of their short interest.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services.\nWe call Amazon the e-commerce giant because it is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. It is also worth noting that its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), increased its revenue by 17.2%, year-over-year in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) can also be considered a rising AI star. Over the past few months, the company has not only partnered with AI startups and the US government, but it has also been actively investing in the development of AI chips. Its AI journey does not end here. The tech company has powered its e-commerce platform with AI to help customers shop, and receive intuitive product recommendations, and ideal price packages.\nAnalysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to an 18% upside from current levels.

        "Author": "  Glenn Taylor ",
        "Text": "Even Amazon needs warehouse assistance from other global logistics players from time to time.\nMaersk is reportedly providing the e-commerce giant with fulfillment services at a 1 million-square-foot warehouse in Denain, France, according to French newspaper La Voix du Nord. Most known for its ocean freight capabilities, Maersk is renting the building from industrial real estate developer GLP.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nShuffle Board: Fair Trade Founder Departs, Target Names CFO\nAmazon Hikes Hourly Warehouse, Delivery Minimum Wage to $22\nAmazon Launches Project Amelia, a Commerce Chatbot for its Third-Party Sellers\nSourcing Journal reached out to Amazon and Maersk.\nA spokesperson for Maersk told supply chain publication The Loadstar that Maersk would occupy 75 percent of the facility, but did not confirm Amazon was the customer. Maersk plans to employ 430 workers at the site during the peak holiday season and 240 during off-peak periods, that report said.\nFrench news outlet France Bleu noted that Amazon doesn\u2019t own the facility, but reported that a company rep said, \u201cLike other companies in the logistics sector, Amazon regularly works with third-party companies to complement its own sites.\u201d\nIn Douai, France, Amazon also rents a 750,000-square-foot warehouse that employs 500 staff members. That building is owned by ID Logistics. Maersk itself doesn\u2019t have an owned warehouse in France, but has more than 30 warehouses throughout Europe.\nAmazon has made a significant investment into its operations in France in 2024, unveiling in May it would pour 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) into the country to create more than 3,000 permanent jobs.\nAs of that announcement, Amazon already operated more than 35 of its own logistics facilities in the country. The new investment would support further expansion of the company\u2019s logistics infrastructure to cut the time and distance necessary to serve customers, all while increasing delivery speeds.\nAt home in the U.S., Amazon recently gave warehouse workers a long-sought pay bump to an average of $22 per hour, up from the prior hourly $20.50. All warehouse staff will get free access to Prime as part of the benefit.\nFor Maersk, the company has expanded beyond its ocean carrier roots in recent years to build out a more substantial logistics offering. The firm doubled its North American warehousing and distribution capacity in February 2020 when it acquired Performance Team for $545 million, and extended the warehousing and fulfillment ambitions further into the Far East when it acquired Hong Kong-based contract logistics company LF Logistics for $3.6 billion.\nMaersk\u2019s logistics and services division saw revenue growth of 7.3 percent to $3.6 billion in the second quarter due to increased volumes across all services, more than offsetting continued low rates. The \u201cFulfilled by Maersk\u201d offering, which is the warehouse and distribution service that Amazon likely is using at the Denain location, saw revenue increase 12.6 percent to $1.4 billion. Ground freight and last-mile delivery accounted for the majority of the increase, Maersk said.\nThe Amazon-Maersk partnership in Denain wouldn\u2019t mark the first time the global logistics players have collaborated, but the previous endeavors have been related more to sustainability efforts out on the ocean.\nMaersk\u2019s goal to reach net-zero by 2040 aligns with the company\u2019s commitment to The Climate Pledge, an Amazon-founded decarbonization effort for corporations to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to be compliant with the Paris Agreement\u2019s 2050 net-zero goal 10 years ahead of schedule.\nAmazon has participated in Maersk\u2019s Eco Delivery low-carbon shipping program since 2020, with the companies agreeing last year to transport 20,000 40-foot containers using green biofuel. With the year-long agreement, the companies could reduce 44,600 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) used, roughly equal to 50 million pounds of coal burned.\nThe Eco Delivery biofuel option is designed to offer emission reductions that enable immediate and externally verified greenhouse gas (GHG) savings for customers, without compensatory measures like offsetting.\nAs worries of a strike on the East and Gulf Coast ports on Oct. 1 set in, Maersk is the latest major ocean carrier to announce a surcharge related to the potential backlog.\nThe move following similar announcements by Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), Hapag-Lloyd and CMA CGM, all of which added fees on moving product to the East and Gulf Coasts.\nMaersk\u2019s potential port disruption surcharge for all cargo moving to and from the U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast terminals would be effective Oct. 21, 2024.\nThe surcharge is rated at $1,500 per 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU), $3,000 per 40-foot containers and $3,780 for a 45-footer.\n\u201cThis surcharge is necessary to cover the higher operational costs that will be incurred due to the service disruptions, ensuring the sustainability of our services and ongoing support for your supply chain requirements,\u201d Maersk said.\n"

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the new buzzword that is attracting the attention of almost everyone on Wall Street. The sector, characterized by rapid growth, significant investment, and intense competition, has witnessed a surge in venture capital (VC) funding over the past few months. In 2023, global VC investment in AI startups exceeded $94 billion. This surge in funding reflects the strong belief that these investors have in the transformative potential of AI across various industries. Merger and acquisition activity in the field is also on the rise, with more than 1,100 such deals in 2023 alone. Larger tech companies are actively acquiring AI startups to bolster their capabilities in the shortest time possible.\nSome sector-specific numbers highlight the AI potential in minute detail. For example, in the healthcare universe, the AI healthcare market is projected to reach $102 billion by 2028, with startups focusing on diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. In finance, AI-driven financial services are expected to reach a market value of $26.67 billion by 2026, with startups focusing on fintech, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading. In the retail world, AI is revolutionizing through personalized shopping experiences and supply chain optimization, with the sector projected to grow at a 34.4% CAGR by 2030.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nHedge fund interest in AI has increased in the past few months, an indication of the long-term growth potential of the industry. During routine interviews with the media, investor conferences, and through their 13F activity, hedge fund managers have detailed their bullish views on AI. For example, Bill Ackman, the chief Pershing Square Capital Management, has said that AI startups represent the next frontier in technology, offering unparalleled opportunities for innovation. He adds that the key is finding those with a clear vision and the ability to execute in a rapidly evolving landscape.\nSimilarly, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates is of the opinion that the impact of AI on industries is undeniable, and the startups driving this change are in a unique position to capitalize on it. Dalio adds, however, that it's crucial to invest in those that are building sustainable, ethical models, as they will be the long-term winners. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corporation believes that AI startups are not just about tech but about transforming entire industries. He notes that the challenge is in navigating the hype and identifying the true innovators who have the potential to disrupt established markets.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

Latest reports reveal that Amazon will power the latest updates to Alexa, the virtual assistant it has been marketing for years, with the AI model of Anthropic, a California-based AI startup. The reports indirectly reveal the failure of in-house AI models at Amazon, with some sources that spoke to news agency Reuters claiming that the in-house AI models of Amazon have lag times of six or seven seconds and problems with consistency and accuracy. The tech giant will charge $5 or $10 per month for advanced AI features in Alexa.\nFollowing the latest earnings release, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) earned an Overweight rating at Morgan Stanley with a price target of $210. In an investor note, the advisory highlighted that the mix shift toward lower average selling price and lower margin items, combined with a slower than expected ramp in high-margin advertising and cost to serve improvements, was weighing on profits of the tech giant more than expected.\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks you should not have missed.

Recent reports suggest the company may have gone a little too far.\nA Reddit user last week posted on the AmazonDSP subreddit about a new topic that arose during his company\u2019s regular safety briefing. In the post, spotted by Freight Waves, the user said their team was reportedly told that Amazon is cracking down on distracted driving, so they can't be \u201csinging along to the radio because the camera will ding you for distracted driving.\" When the drivers became upset, they were told that a lot of mouth movement would set off the camera so they \"needed to keep mouth movement to a minimum.\u201d\nA few other Reddit users said they had heard the same thing and that it applied to other activities like hands-free phone conversations.\nBut Amazon Spokesperson Steve Kelly refuted the report and called the post completely inaccurate.

The company obviously has a vested interest in maintaining a safe and efficient fleet for deliveries, the backbone of its e-commerce business. And it often faces lawsuits and large legal settlements if Amazon drivers are involved in accidents.\nBut it doesn\u2019t make sense or sound very sustainable for the company to stop its drivers from singing along with the radio or having a hands-free phone conversation, an idea that has obviously touched a nerve with some drivers. According to the NHTSA, distracted driving activities include texting, eating or drinking, or \u201cfiddling with the stereo.\u201d Nowhere does it say you can\u2019t hit all the high notes in \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believing.\u201d Or have a conversation if there\u2019s someone else in the truck. Most of these things are perfectly safe as long as you keep your eyes on the road.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that in Amazon\u2019s own video titled, \u201cA Day in the Life of an Amazon Driver,\u201d Adam, the featured driver, actually sings \u201cBaby Driver\u201d by Simon & Garfunkel while driving his truck.\nClick here to subscribe to our daily newsletter featuring breaking manufacturing industry news.\n"

Companies are investing billions in AI and they expect to see the results of their investments in the coming months and years.

It is continuously making strides in the Generative AI (GenAI) technology, which has now become mainstream in the cloud industry.\u00a0Amazon has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, integrating GenAI capabilities across its AWS product suite. Growing AI capabilities have positioned AMZN as a leader in the cloud market.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nDespite being the dominant player in the cloud market, the company faces strong competition from cloud giants like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google, which are also making concerted efforts to power their cloud solutions with GenAI.This raises a crucial question of whether Amazon\u2019s AI advancements will drive the momentum in its share price amid stiff GenAI and cloud competition.\nAWS is gaining significantly from the solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.The company\u2019s introduction of Bedrock innovations, including custom model import and model evaluation capabilities and Guardrails, is a positive. These features are designed to provide customers with a secure, easy and fast way to develop advanced generative AI applications.With a wide selection of foundation models from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI and Stability AI, Bedrock offers seamless deployment, scalability and continuous optimization.AWS also offers a generative AI-powered assistant called Amazon Q, which generates codes, tests and debugs, and has multi-step planning and reasoning capabilities.The company\u2019s collaboration with NVIDIA, through which it will make the latter\u2019s Blackwell GPU platform available on AWS, is a plus. This will help speed up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion-parameter language models.Amazon recently unveiled a GenAI-powered service called AWS App Studio, which helps create enterprise-grade applications by leveraging natural language. It simplifies and fastens the process of developing an application from scratch.AWS partnered with Intel INTC to enhance its AI capabilities. Per the terms, Intel will produce an AI fabric chip for AWS based on its most advanced process node, Intel 18A.

        "Author": "  Jake Spring ",
        "Text": "By Jake Spring\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) -Amazon and other companies have agreed to buy carbon offset credits that will support the conservation of its namesake rainforest in the Brazilian state of Para, in a deal valued at around $180 million.\nAmazon and at least five other firms will make the purchase through the LEAF Coalition forest conservation initiative, which it helped to found in 2021 with a group of companies and governments including the United States and United Kingdom.\nThe agreement is LEAF's first deal in the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, which is vital to curbing climate change because of the enormous amount of greenhouse gas its trees absorb.\nThe Para state government and the LEAF Coalition first shared details of the deal exclusively with Reuters. Para Governor Helder Barbalho announced the agreement on Tuesday during New York Climate Week, when about 900 events will be held alongside the UN General Assembly.\nBarbalho said the state would only collect the portion of the sales' proceeds needed to continue its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, while the rest would go to Indigenous peoples, former slave and traditional extractivist communities as well as family farms.\n\"Clearly it sends an important message: A company with a name referencing the Amazon making its first purchase with a state in the Amazon,\" Barbalho told Reuters separately.\nAmazon confirmed the purchase in a statement, emphasizing the importance of tropical forest preservation in addressing climate change.\nWhile demand for carbon credits globally has stalled, tech giants Microsoft, Meta and Google have all made purchases of offsets in Brazil this year.\nAmazon, drug and chemical maker Bayer, consultancies BCG and Capgemini, clothing retailer H&M and Walmart Foundation will collectively buy 5 million credits at $15 per credit. That is far above the average last week of $4.49 for carbon credits linked to nature, according to data provider Allied Offsets.\nEach credit represents a reduction of 1 metric ton of carbon emissions from reducing deforestation in Par\u00e1 state in the years 2023 to 2026.\nAnother 7 million credits will be made available for other companies to purchase. The U.S., U.K. and Norwegian governments have guaranteed a portion of those credits and will buy them if companies do not.\nPara will host the UN COP30 climate summit next year, in a move that is the centerpiece of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's bid to restore Brazil's environmental credentials after years of soaring deforestation.\nPara has been the top state for deforestation since 2005, although destruction has been falling there since 2021. An area larger than New York City has been deforested in Para from January to August this year, a 20% decline from a year ago, according to preliminary federal government data.\nBarbalho said at Climate Week that the government will by 2026 have complete traceability of supply chains for cattle, a key driver of deforestation in Para.\n(Reporting by Jake Spring; Additional reporting by Andre Romani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Nick Zieminski)\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this online retailer have returned +2.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.15 per share, indicating a change of +35.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +63.5%. This estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 indicates a change of +23.2% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $157.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $634.49 billion and $702.77 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +10.8% changes, respectively.\nAmazon reported revenues of $147.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.63 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.44%. The EPS surprise was +17.14%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "So far this year, Buy with Prime orders through merchants\u2019 websites are up more than 45% year-over-year; the service is also driving an average 16% increase in revenue per shopper for merchants offering Buy with Prime\nBuy with Prime shoppers can now use PayPal to check out on participating merchants\u2019 websites\nNew advertising solutions with Amazon Demand-Side Platform, Google Shopping Ads, and TikTok Ads help merchants drive traffic to their Buy with Prime enabled items\nAmazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment is also growing quickly, now serving over 200,000 U.S. merchants, with a 70% year-over-year increase in total orders fulfilled by the service so far this year\nSEATTLE, September 18, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today at Amazon\u2019s Accelerate seller conference, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) direct-to-customer (DTC) offerings, Buy with Prime and Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment (Amazon MCF), announced a number of enhancements to their merchant and shopper experiences. These new capabilities are part of Amazon\u2019s focus on innovating to help businesses of all sizes increase their sales on their own online stores and other channels beyond Amazon.com.\nTransforming how Brands Grow Across their Sales Channels\nTo help merchants build and scale their businesses across their own websites, other marketplace service providers, and social media channels, Amazon offers a suite of externalized ecommerce services that leverage the power of Amazon\u2019s fulfillment network and the Prime shopping experience. Amazon MCF is the foundational supply chain service operating in more than 10 countries. This service gives merchants the option to have Amazon pick, pack, and ship their orders for channels beyond Amazon.com. Buy with Prime, currently available in the U.S., uses the trust and recognition of the Prime brand to help increase traffic and sales on merchant DTC websites, while also leveraging Amazon MCF to fulfill and deliver orders. For Prime members, Buy with Prime is a member benefit that unlocks even greater selection, value, and convenience beyond Amazon.com. By using Amazon MCF and Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), merchants can quickly scale up and scale down a single, shared pool of inventory based on customer demand across their sales channels. This has helped merchants cut out-of-stock rates by an average of 13% and improve inventory turnover by an average of 24%. Amazon\u2019s continued innovation in Amazon MCF and Buy with Prime have made them invaluable tools for merchants looking to grow and scale their businesses across all their sales channels.\n\"Buy with Prime and Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment continue to help sellers attract new shoppers with the convenient, fast, and predictable experience they expect from Amazon,\" said Peter Larsen, vice president of Buy with Prime and Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment. \"Both services have seen significant growth over the last year, and we\u2019re delighted to add to the momentum and partner with PayPal, Google, TikTok Ads, and Shopify to give brands even more options to grow their businesses.\"\nMerchant Growth with Buy with Prime\nBuy with Prime launched in 2022 with a dozen brands and the goal of helping DTC merchants overcome challenges with acquiring new shoppers and driving conversion by offering quick and reliable delivery, and increasing their long-term relationships with customers. By leveraging the power of Amazon\u2019s fulfillment network and the trust and recognition of the Prime brand, Buy with Prime continues to focus on helping businesses grow by making it easy for them to offer fast, free delivery; easy returns; 24/7 shopper support; and a convenient checkout experience.\nBuy with Prime momentum includes:\nSaw an increase so far this year of more than 45% in Buy with Prime orders year-over-year through merchant websites, with merchants generating an average 16% increase in revenue per shopper from offering Buy with Prime.\nHelped merchants bring new traffic to their site so far this year, with over 50% more Prime members shopping Buy with Prime year-over-year.\nLeveraged one of Amazon\u2019s biggest shopping moments of the year to garner a 300% increase in the number of orders for Buy with Prime merchants during the Prime Day 2024 event.\nIncreased the number of merchants offering Buy with Prime so far this year by over 25% year-over-year with hundreds of new brands to shop including IZOD, Elizabeth Arden, Dollar Shave Club, Shokz, Brumate, Buxom Cosmetics, Thunder Works, Toroe, Backbone, babysense, Tini Lux, Feliway, Iron Flask, Nectarlife, Waterdrop Filter, and more.\n\"No matter the history or longevity of your store, if someone sees Buy with Prime and the option to check out using their Amazon account, it gives them an elevated sense of trust,\" said David Parrish, founder and chief executive officer for SnS Grills, a Buy with Prime merchant. \"Our experience with Buy with Prime is simple: it works, and it works well. We think it\u2019s a powerful solution for merchants, and those who adopt it will see the rewards\u2014quickly.\"\nDriving Traffic Through New Advertising Solutions\nTo help merchants lower their cost to acquire new customers and drive traffic to their Buy with Prime enabled items, Buy with Prime is introducing two unique advertising solutions:\nIntroducing Amazon DSP for Buy with Prime \u2013 Buy with Prime merchants can now launch Amazon Demand-Side Platform (DSP) campaigns that leverage Amazon product-level shopping signals to drive traffic to their ecommerce websites. By combining insights from their Amazon.com listings\u2014like product views and purchases\u2014with shopping signals from their own website, merchants can remarket to these shoppers with ads across thousands of third-party apps and websites. More than 80% of merchants who\u2019ve used Amazon DSP for Buy with Prime have reported meeting or exceeding their return on ad spend (ROAS) goals.\nIntegrating Delivery Estimates in TikTok Ads \u2013 Buy with Prime merchants will be able to display the Prime brand and real-time delivery estimates in their TikTok Ads next month. After clicking the Shop with Prime button within the merchant\u2019s ad, shoppers will be directed to the merchant\u2019s website to place their order. Featuring the familiar Prime delivery estimate will help merchants stand out, drive traffic from social channels, and increase conversion.\n\"Within two weeks of using Amazon DSP for Buy with Prime to remarket to engaged shoppers across the web, it\u2019s already our second-highest performing ad channel giving us an incredibly strong return on advertising spend,\" said Tommy Kowalski, vice president of digital commerce for HEYDUDE, a Buy with Prime merchant.\nDelighting Buy with Prime Shoppers with New Ways to Pay and Check out\nContinuing the Buy with Prime journey to extend Prime shopping benefits beyond Amazon.com, the company is rolling out enhancements to the Buy with Prime shopping experience, including:\nExpanded Payment Options with PayPal \u2013 For participating brands integrating using the Buy with Prime API, PayPal is now available at checkout after shoppers log in to their Amazon account. And starting next year, Prime members will be able to perform a one-time link of their Amazon account to their PayPal account so that Prime free, fast shipping benefits are available automatically whenever they use PayPal while shopping with Buy with Prime on participating merchants\u2019 websites.\nPurchase items with Prime and without Prime in one Checkout via Shopify Stores \u2013 Using the existing Shopify cart and checkout, shoppers can now purchase items with Prime and without Prime, together in one order. This capability extends the functionality of the Buy with Prime app for Shopify that launched in the Shopify App Store last year to help merchants increase their units per order and average order value.\nDriving Sales Growth with Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment\nWith Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment, merchants can leverage Amazon\u2019s fulfillment network to pick, pack, ship, and deliver their orders from channels beyond Amazon.com, including their own website, other ecommerce marketplaces, and social media channels. This solution works with over 100 prebuilt integrations or merchants can build a custom integration tailored to their needs.\nAmazon MCF has grown to serve over 200,000 U.S. merchants and seen a 70% year-over-year increase in total orders fulfilled by the service so far this year. To further improve the delivery experience and drive traffic to merchants\u2019 websites, Amazon MCF is introducing:\nSpeeding Up the Amazon MCF Standard Delivery Option by 40% \u2013 As Amazon continues to invest in speed throughout its fulfillment network, Amazon MCF is now reducing its Standard Delivery option from 5 business days to 3 business days at no extra cost to merchants. Customers can now enjoy this faster delivery speed along with deliveries made 7 days a week.\nMCF Fast Badges for Merchant Websites \u2013 Like with Buy with Prime, merchants can now show a dynamic, real-time delivery estimate on their website. MCF fast badges give shoppers visibility into when they'll receive the product early in their shopping journey, and helps merchants increase shopper conversion. For example, sports apparel company NXTRND saw an 8.9% increase in revenue using an Amazon MCF delivery estimate.\nDelivery Estimates in Google Shopping and TikTok Ads \u2013 This month, merchants will also be able to show an estimated delivery date in their Google Shopping ads and search results, and in their TikTok ads. Displaying a fast, reliable delivery speed on ads can help merchants drive more shoppers to their site while boosting their ROAS.\n\"With Amazon Multi-Channel Fulfillment, our ability to scale was essentially unlimited. We didn\u2019t have to buy warehouses, trucks, planes, or other logistics resources like packaging or labels\u2014we could rely on Amazon to provide that,\" said Craig Barnell, co-founder and chief operating officer, Fishers Finery, an Amazon MCF merchant. \"Amazon has helped us to exceed customers\u2019 expectations. In fact, we regularly get emails from customers saying, \u2018I can\u2019t believe how fast and on-time our package got to us!\u2019\"\nMerchants interested in learning more can visit the Buy with Prime website or Amazon MCF website.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240918507437/en/\nContacts\nAmazon.com, Inc.Media HotlineAmazon-pr@amazon.com www.amazon.com/pr\n"

        "Author": "  Maham Fatima ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other buzzing stocks.\nSeptember and October tend to be the most volatile months for the stock market, particularly during election years. This was recently discussed by Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, who expects the volatility to stay until the end of October.\nStovall says that while the S&P 500 recovered all its 2022 bear market losses by January this year, and reached 22 new all-time highs by March, equities have digested some of these gains and experienced sector rotation away from 2023 high flyers into more defensive areas of the market. Hence, the year started great, but the markets are declining once again. The S&P 500\u2019s average volatility in October 2023 was 35% higher than the average for the remaining 11 months of the year.\nInvestors are concerned that the Fed will be slower to lower interest rates while inflation remains sticky and GDP growth begins to cool. Stovall expects three 25-basis point cuts this year, followed by another four in 2025. He thinks that while a 50 basis point cut is rare since it only ever happened twice, in 2001 and then 2007, it is still not unlikely given that the economy is worse than expected.\nAccording to Stovall, investors need to be prepared for this increased volatility as the market digests the Fed\u2019s actions and the potential impact on the economy. The market will likely remain uncertain until the Fed can find the right balance between slowing down the economy and stopping inflation, without causing a recession.\nTom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, is of a similar idea, suggesting that investors should remain cautious over the next 8 weeks, due to both uncertainty surrounding elections and the September cuts. He says that the stock market may experience a 7-10% pullback, considering there have already been two 7% corrections this year.\nLee thinks at least a 5% pullback can be anticipated, but if it\u2019s only 1-2%, then that\u2019s negligible. But despite the recommended caution for the 8 weeks starting September, he thinks the volatility does not translate into a tough full-year. He views this pullback as a buying opportunity, believing that the market has not yet reached its peak for 2024.\nAs Lee encourages investors to be ready to buy the dip, we are here with a list of the most buzzing stocks to buy now.\nNote: All price/volume data is as of September 6.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nVolume: 28.588M million\nAverage Volume (3-Month): 42.624 million\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. The e-commerce platform works in 20 countries and ships to over 100. Its global cloud platform operates under the name of Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nIt captures over 40% of the e-commerce market in the US. AWS increased its revenue from 18.8% year-over-year in Q2 2024. The overall company revenue in the second quarter was $147.98 billion, representing a 10.12% year-over-year improvement. However, there was a loss per share of $1.26 in this period.\nAWS is projected to grow annually by 15% to 21% through 2028, making its performance a crucial factor in future profit forecasts.\nOver the past months, the company partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models.\nIn July, it processed a new server design, similar to the ones produced by NVIDIA. It has invested in hardware for long, considering that its non-AI computing chip, Graviton, has been under development for almost a decade. More recent chips by the company include Trainium and Inferentia. On Prime Day, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) deployed a quarter million Graviton Chips and 80,000 custom AI chips to manage the surging activity on its platforms.\nIn August, it launched Room Decorator, which allows users to visualize various furniture pieces in their space. Commitment to such advancements is a testament to the company\u2019s long-term growth, making it a top buzzing stock.\nIt should benefit from the early-September expected rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. Even the slightest reduction in borrowing costs should support the consumer purchasing power.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is held by 308 hedge funds, of which the highest stake is valued at $8,460,561,806 by\u00a0Fisher Asset Management.\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cFounded in 1994,\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has evolved from its early roots as an online bookstore to become one of the world\u2019s largest eCommerce retailers. At the end of 2023 Amazon stood poised to capture ~40% of all US e-commerce sales, representing five times more share than the next closest competitor. In addition to eCommerce, Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) has become the market leader in outsourced cloud infrastructure. Further, Amazon Advertising is garnering significant share in digital advertising, particularly product placement ads, thanks to consumers beginning their product searches on Amazon\u2019s site. Amazon\u2019s stock appreciated on the back of stabilization of the company\u2019s cloud computing segment and increased confidence management would be able to contain expenses and push operating margins above prior peaks in the near-to-medium term.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list the most buzzing stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the growth potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $157.05 billion, showing a 9.76% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\nAMZN's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.74 per share and revenue of $634.49 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +63.45% and +10.39%, respectively.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.48% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. Right now, Amazon possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nIn the context of valuation, Amazon is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 39.39. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 22.78.\nOne should further note that AMZN currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.44. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. As the market closed yesterday, the Internet - Commerce industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.07.\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 57, finds itself in the top 23% echelons of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 9.7% over the last month. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Amazon.com's  ROE in this article.\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n19% = US$44b \u00f7 US$236b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.19 in profit.\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nAt first glance, Amazon.com seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 21%. This certainly adds some context to Amazon.com's moderate 14% net income growth seen over the past five years.\nNext, on comparing Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 15% over the last few years.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is AMZN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\nAmazon.com doesn't pay any regular dividends currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the decent earnings growth number that we discussed above.\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Amazon.com's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "Title": "Andy Jassy\u2019s return-to-office mandate shows how serious the Amazon culture mid-life crisis has gotten",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "For years, Amazon employees and executives have warned that the company\u2019s unique corporate culture was starting to fray. The worries have crescendoed recently, as I reported in this deep Fortune investigation on the growing pains of Jeff Bezos\u2019 famed leadership principles and management rules.\nOn Monday, Bezos successor Andy Jassy tacitly acknowledged this reality while proposing a pair of would-be silver bullets: a push to flatten the organization and reduce middle management layers and, most controversially, a five-day return-to-office mandate starting in January. Amazon has employed a hybrid work model in recent years, requiring in-office work three days a week since May of 2023.\n\"When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant,\" Jassy wrote. \"I\u2019ve previously explained these benefits, but in summary, we\u2019ve observed that it\u2019s easier for our teammates to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.\"\nThe shift to full-time in-office work marks a major shift for Amazon employees that will please some and undoubtedly drive others from the company, employees told me today. It will serve as a first for a majority of current Amazon corporate employees who've never worked in an Amazon office full-time, while for long-time corporate employees, it will be the first time since the pandemic began five years ago that they to work alongside their colleagues on a daily basis.\nMore face-to-face time will no doubt help rebuild some of those muscles. Amazon insiders have lamented the difficulty of learning the nuances of Amazon's principles and practices during remote work.\nThe challenge for Jassy and his senior leadership team \u2013 or S-team \u2013 is that hybrid work is not the sole cause of the company's endangered corporate culture.\nThe loss of longtime talent, including the high-profile departures of veterans like former Amazon consumer business CEOs Dave Clark in 2022 and Jeff Wilke in 2021, as well as Bezos\u2019 departure from the CEO role that same year, has significantly diluted the company's traditions, employees have said.\n\u201cCulture takes active architecture and work,\u201d a former Amazon vice president who worked at the company for more than 15 years told Fortune earlier this year. \u201cThere was nobody else left to teach [that],\u201d the former exec added, in a nod to all the top leaders who have left the company.\nJassy & Co. also face a reality that many employees already believed that the original three-day return-to-work mandate severed trust between leadership and the rank-and-file when it was instituted last year. At the time, more than 30,000 Amazon employees joined an internal Slack channel to discuss opposition to that move, with some helping to create a six-page memo \u2014 a prototypical Amazon document format \u2014 to lay out their concerns. Today, anger is a common emotion among those I've spoken with.\nStill others pointed to the addition of two new Leadership Principles in 2021 \u2014 \u201cStrive to be Earth\u2019s best employer\u201d and \u201cSuccess and scale bring broad responsibility\u201d \u2014 as a turning point for how vague many employees thought the new rules, and how they diluted the other principles that came before them.\n\u201cThey are clearly a marketing ploy and they devalue the rest of the Leadership Principles,\u201d one former senior manager of more than 10 years who left the company recently told Fortune earlier this year. \u201cTotal bullshit,\u201d was how a former longtime communications employee at Amazon who was still at the company at the time summed them up, saying the new maxims were \u201cplaying the reputational game versus guiding how you think.\u201d\nAgain, today's announcement won't cure any of this. If anything, employees who spoke to Fortune on Monday expressed a belief that the new mandate actively goes against the idea of a \"best employer.\"\nAll of that said, there is another component of Jassy's announcement that the CEO hopes will revitalize some of the deficiencies in the corporate culture.\n\"[W]e\u2019re asking each...organization to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025,\" Jassy wrote. \"Having fewer managers will remove layers and flatten organizations more than they are today. If we do this work well, it will increase our teammates\u2019 ability to move fast, clarify and invigorate their sense of ownership, drive decision-making closer to the front lines where it most impacts customers (and the business), decrease bureaucracy, and strengthen our organizations\u2019 ability to make customers\u2019 lives better and easier every day.\"\nIn recent years, many company employees have told me that middle management became bloated as hiring dramatically increased between 2019 and 2021. Even with the layoffs of tens of thousands of corporate employees under Jassy, the problem festered, employees have told Fortune. During those intense hiring cycles, thousands of managers and executives not steeped in the Amazon Way joined the company.\nIt remains to be seen whether Amazon's purge of middle managers, via the new manager-contributor ratios, increase its decision-making and innovation metabolism. The unintended consequences of such a move will also be worth watching.\nEither way, Jassy is making a calculated bet that a controversial kick in the pants will recharge Amazon's cherished culture. But the risks are very real.\nAre you a current or former Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime Video streaming service surpassed its goal of $1.8 billion in upfront advertising commitments for 2025, according to a recent report from The Information.\nThe achievement reportedly exceeded Amazon's internal expectations and marks a significant step forward for the platform's advertising business, according to Bank of America analysts in a note Monday.\nDespite Prime Video only serving ads for the past nine months, advertisers seem to be seeing strong returns on their investments, BofA noted.\nThe analysts highlighted Prime Video's large ad-supported user base of approximately 115 million U.S. viewers, an expanding content slate, including a $1.9 billion annual deal for NBA games, and advanced data and measurement capabilities integrated with Amazon's retail platform.\nWhile Amazon's upfront commitments for streaming are impressive, the bank says they still trail behind larger players like Disney and NBCUniversal, which generated $9 billion and $7 billion in upfronts, respectively, in 2022.\nEven YouTube, which has made significant strides in TV viewership, reportedly expects to generate around $7 billion in upfronts for 2024.\nBofA sees significant growth potential for Amazon's ad business. They estimate that Prime Video could be on track to generate $3.5 billion to $4 billion in ad revenue for 2025, accounting for 5-6% of Amazon's overall ad revenue forecast for the year.\nThe analysts had previously estimated that Prime Video could reach $4.6 billion in ad sales by 2025.\nFurthermore, BofA believes Amazon's continued investment in live sports, including a $1 billion per year deal for Thursday Night Football, positions the platform to further increase engagement and ad sales.\nThe bank remains \"constructive\" on the future growth of Prime Video's ad business, maintaining a Buy rating with a price target of $210 on Amazon shares. They stated, \"Amazon appears well on its way to building an effective streaming ad platform.\"\nRelated Articles\nAmazon Prime Video\u2019s upfronts reportedly beat internal expectations: BofA\nGlenview Capital to push CVS Health to make changes - Wall Street Journal\nFord to offer free chargers to EV buyers through year-end\n"

        "Title": "Amazon employees slam CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s demand to return to office \u2014 do American workers have a right to work from home?",
        "Author": "  Christy Bieber ",
        "Text": "Amazon employees are up-in-arms over a recent note from CEO Andy Jassy alerting them to a change in policy about remote work.\nIn a Sept. 16 letter, Jassy said that employees would be expected to return to the office five days a week, barring extenuating circumstances or a remote work exception, beginning on Jan. 2, 2025.\nHere is the true value of having a fully paid-off home in America \u2014 especially when you're heading into retirement\n'I could've been set for life': This former Goldman Sachs analyst says his family of 4 can't live comfortably on $230K a year after buying 'forever home.' Is the American dream out of reach?\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years \u2014 but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger\nAs Jassy pointed out: \"Some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments,\" but he's made clear that this isn't optional given the type of team he'd like to create.\nUnsurprisingly, however, many workers aren't pleased with the forced change. The big question, though, is what can they do about it?\nAmazon, like many companies, went fully remote during COVID but shifted to a hybrid schedule in May of 2023. Under that policy change, workers were required to come into the office three days a week. At that time, 1,000 employees staged a walkout to protest and 30,000 signed a petition requesting a retraction of the new requirements to be in office.\nThose employees who express their opinions through walkouts and petitions may enjoy protections under the National Labor Relations Act, which gives all workers the right to engage in \"protected concerted activity\" including strikes, picketing or protesting, as long as the employees are responding to a work-related issue that concerns their interests.\nIt's up to the NLRB to determine whether the activity is protected, though, and employers are typically allowed to bring in temporary employees when their regular staff stops working for a protest.\nIn some cases, this type of activity will prompt employers to reconsider their position or to work with their staff members to find a mutually agreeable solution. In Amazon's case, however, the three-day a week policy that the workers were protesting went into effect, and the CEO has now doubled down by mandating workers begin coming in five days weekly.\nSince the company wasn't responsive last time, they probably won't be swayed by the anger workers are currently expressing. Many aired their grievances in an internal Slack channel seen by Business Insider, including some who expressed a desire to get fired or a plan to take their money and find work elsewhere.\nUnfortunately, while those workers can express their anger and even stage further protests, ultimately they may have few choices but to come back to work, quit or, as some say is their plan, force Amazon to terminate them for failure to perform.\nRead More: Feeling broke on a $665K salary: This surgeon and his wife didn't realize their financial adviser may have been charging a high fee until Ramit Sethi set things straight\nThe general rule in the United States is that workers are at will employees. They can be fired for any reason or no reason at all \u2014 and failure to return to the office when required would certainly be a justification for letting them go.\nThere are some limited exceptions to this rule. If someone has an employment contract negotiated on their own, or as part of a union, then an employer can't violate its terms. If it says staff can work remotely, employers must allow them to do so unless they can renegotiate the deal.\nLikewise, being able to work from home is sometimes considered a reasonable accommodation for a disability, although this is more likely when an employer does allow some telework and it usually won't be an option if the company can accommodate the disability in-office.\nThe bottom line is that Amazon workers are probably out of luck and just have to head back to the office. And the same is true for others who may be working remotely but whose companies change the rules.\nIf your employer says you must come into the office, you'll need to listen or look for another position with a remote-friendly business that won't force you to make that dreaded commute.\nArizona man says his gap insurance won't pay an $18,000 claim for his totaled BMW because of a 60-cent mistake\nTexas man used to spend $9,000 a month partying, now refuses to work more than 15 hours a week to pay off debt\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof \u2014 and only getting worse.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com's estimated fair value is US$331 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nCurrent share price of US$171 suggests Amazon.com is potentially 48% undervalued\nOur fair value estimate is 51% higher than Amazon.com's analyst price target of US$219\nHow far off is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$71.9b\nUS$94.9b\nUS$113.5b\nUS$134.0b\nUS$149.2b\nUS$162.2b\nUS$173.3b\nUS$182.9b\nUS$191.4b\nUS$199.0b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x18\nAnalyst x9\nAnalyst x5\nAnalyst x4\nEst @ 11.37%\nEst @ 8.71%\nEst @ 6.85%\nEst @ 5.54%\nEst @ 4.63%\nEst @ 3.99%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% \nUS$67.3k\nUS$83.3k\nUS$93.3k\nUS$103.1k\nUS$107.6k\nUS$109.5k\nUS$109.6k\nUS$108.3k\nUS$106.2k\nUS$103.4k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$992b\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.8%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$199b\u00d7 (1 + 2.5%) \u00f7 (6.8%\u2013 2.5%) = US$4.8t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$2.5t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.5t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$171, the company appears quite undervalued at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.036. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

        "Title": "Amazon Prime Day: Here's How to Maximize Your Spending",
        "Author": "  Maurie Backman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "\nIf you love mega shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you may be happy to hear that you don't have to wait until late November to go on a spending spree. Amazon's October Prime Day event, known as Prime Big Deal Days, is scheduled to take place on Oct. 8 and 9. During that time, shoppers can potentially enjoy a lower credit card tab when they buy thousands of items on the site.\nBut if you're on a budget -- which you should be, at least to some degree -- you'll want to manage an event like Prime Big Deal Days carefully. Here's how to make the most of it without going overboard.\nLightning deals are limited-time specials offered by Amazon. They generally last for a few hours, and they're not exclusive to Prime Day events. You might find a lightning deal on a random Tuesday just by scrolling the site.\nBut during events like Prime Big Deal Days, you can expect many lightning deals to drop. And that's not necessarily a good thing.\nWith lightning deals, there's only a limited quantity of the product that's being offered at a discount. That puts the pressure on to scoop up a deal while you can. As a result, you might end up making impulse purchases that drive you over your budget and lead you into debt. You might also end up spending so much on unplanned buys that you don't have enough money left over for the items you really wanted.\nBecause of this, you'll need to be careful with lightning deals. As you come across them, ask yourself: \"Would I actually want this item if it wasn't on sale?\" If the answer is no, you should pass.\nAmazon doesn't have an unlimited supply of every item it stocks. And some of the more popular items could easily sell out during Prime Big Deal Days. If you have your eyes on a particular product, you may want to see if you can sign up for an invitation to buy it.\nAmazon will designate some items as invite-only deals for Prime Big Deal Days. If you come across one of these items, there should be an invitation button you can click that gives you access to the sale price on Oct. 8 or 9. You'll get a notification by email or through the Amazon app once your deal becomes available. It's an easy way to make sure you don't miss out.\nAnd if you do miss out on an invite-only deal, shop around for an alternative source. There's a good chance Amazon's competitors will offer up their own bargains during Amazon's upcoming October Prime Day event. And you may find the exact same item you wanted at an equally good price if you check Walmart, Target, or other major stores.\nYou may be excited about Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days event.

        "Title": "Intel to Make Custom AI Chip for Amazon, Delay German Plant",
        "Author": "  Ian King ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger has landed Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS as a customer for the company\u2019s manufacturing business, potentially bringing work to new plants under construction in the US and boosting his efforts to turn around the embattled chipmaker.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority\nThe Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America\u2019s Roads\nCalifornia\u2019s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough\nNew York City\u2019s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways\nTo Build a Happier City, Design for Density\nIntel and AWS will coinvest in a custom semiconductor for artificial intelligence computing \u2013 what\u2019s known as a fabric chip \u2013 in a \u201cmultiyear, multibillion-dollar framework,\u201d according to a statement Monday. The work will rely on Intel\u2019s 18A process, an advanced chipmaking technology.\nThe shares jumped more than 7% in premarket trading on Tuesday. They had been down 58% this year, closing at $20.91 on Monday.\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is big,\u201d Gelsinger said in an interview. \u201cThis is a very discerning customer who has very sophisticated design capabilities.\u201d\nThe news was part of a flurry of announcements that followed a pivotal board meeting last week. Intel is also postponing new factories in Germany and Poland, but remains committed to its US expansion in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon and Ohio.\nGelsinger, who embarked on a bold comeback effort for Intel in 2021, has had to scale back some of his ambitions in the name of efficiency. With sales shrinking and losses piling up, the company announced plans last month to slash 15,000 workers, find $10 billion in cost savings and suspend Intel\u2019s dividend. Now he\u2019s going further to rein in expansion plans, especially overseas.\nThe Poland and Germany construction projects will be paused for about two years depending on market demand. Another one in Malaysia will be completed but only put into operation when conditions support it, Intel said.\nThe postponement of the German factory marks a setback for the European Union\u2019s semiconductor ambitions and is likely to reignire controversy in Berlin over where to allocate \u20ac10 billion ($11 billion) in earmarked subsidies.\nAt last week\u2019s three-day board meeting, executives presented options on how to conserve cash while keeping Gelsinger\u2019s turnaround plan on track. The CEO\u2019s effort hinges on transforming Intel into a so-called foundry, a chipmaker that manufacturers products for outside customers. The Santa Clara, California-based company has been slow to line up customers for the project \u2014 and a high-profile client such as Amazon represents a notable win.\nIntel is also looking to speed up efforts to execute the $10 billion in cost savings and focus its products better on AI computing, an area where rival Nvidia Corp. has excelled. It\u2019s also looking to pare its real estate globally by about two-thirds by the end of the year.\nAnd the company reiterated plans to sell part of its stake in Altera Corp. to private equity investors. The business, which Intel bought in 2015, was separated from its operations last year with the goal of taking it public.\nAnother change: Intel\u2019s foundry operations, referred to as IFS, will be further separated from the rest of the company and become a wholly owned subsidiary. That move is aimed in part at convincing prospective customers \u2014 some of whom compete with Intel \u2014 that they are dealing with an independent supplier. Bloomberg reported earlier on a potential foundry separation.\n\u201cWe still have things to learn about becoming a foundry,\u201d Gelsinger said in the interview. \u201cI need lots of customers.\u201d\nAmazon Web Services is the largest provider of cloud computing, and it could help build confidence that Intel can compete with the likes of foundry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. AWS has used Intel processors over the years, but has been shifting more toward in-house designs \u2014 the very products that Intel may now help manufacture.\nMicrosoft Corp., another major cloud-computing provider, announced plans in February to use Intel for some of its in-house chips as well.\nIn another win, Intel said earlier Monday that it\u2019s eligible to receive as much as $3 billion in US government funding to manufacture chips for the military. The effort, called the Secure Enclave, aims to establish a steady supply of cutting-edge chips for defense and intelligence purposes. That news helped send the shares up 6.4% in regular trading Monday.\nThe Secure Enclave award is separate from a possible $8.5 billion Chips and Science Act grant that Intel is set to receive to support factories across four US states. The projects include a facility in New Albany, Ohio, that Intel has said could become the world\u2019s largest chipmaking operation.\nIntel still has a long way to go to win back Wall Street\u2019s full confidence. After years of losing ground to rivals and seeing its technological edge slip, the Silicon Valley pioneer is valued at less than $90 billion. It no longer ranks as one of the top 10 chip companies on that basis. Nvidia, meanwhile, now has a market capitalization of about $2.9 trillion.\nIntel shocked investors with a bleak financial report last month, triggering the biggest single-day stock decline in decades. Analysts described the announcement as Intel\u2019s worst-ever earnings report.\nGelsinger, in a letter to employees, acknowledged that the chipmaker\u2019s performance has drawn negative scrutiny \u2014 and spurred speculation over what might happen to the company. The only way to \u201cquiet our critics\u201d will be to deliver results and execute better, he said. Today\u2019s announcements are a step toward that, he said.\n\u201cIs it good enough? No. Is it substantial? Yes,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cI\u2019ve reupped my commitment. We\u2019re going to finish a seminal assignment.\u201d\n--With assistance from Mackenzie Hawkins.\n(Updates with share move in the third paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool\nTrump\u2019s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection\nThe Host of Hot Ones Spills the Secrets of His Success\nHow a Former IRS Agent Got Locked Up in a Nigerian Prison\nThe Fed Risks a Political Backlash by Spurring Economy Close to Election\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Jane Thier, Nina Ajemian ",
        "Text": "Good morning, Broadsheet readers! Tupperware filed for bankruptcy, Joanna Geraghty\u2019s JetBlue is opening its first airport lounges, and Fortune writer Jane Thier examines how return-to-office mandates like Amazon\u2019s may put women\u2014especially mothers\u2014at a disadvantage. Have a restful weekend. \n- The end of flex. On Monday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that employees would be mandated to return to the office five days a week. \u201cBefore the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward,\u201d Jassy wrote in a memo to employees titled \u201cstrengthening our culture and teams.\u201d\nJassy acknowledged that \u201csome of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments,\u201d but nonetheless, five days is the new expectation come the new year.\nIt didn\u2019t go over well.\nAfter the news broke, several Amazon employees told Fortune\u2019s Jason Del Rey that they believe the new mandate actively runs counter to the company\u2019s purported people-first mission. It also is likely to create an instant hemorrhage of top talent fleeing the tech giant for employers more amenable to flexibility and choice, workplace experts say.\nSome hard-charging companies may be tempted to copy Amazon\u2019s moves, given that it\u2019s \u201cone of the largest private-sector employers in the world, and the second-largest in the U.S.,\u201d Del Rey wrote. \u201cOn the other hand, competitors could seize on the mandate to attract talented Amazon workers looking for more flexible work.\u201d\nEmployees pointed out that this mandate is harsher than prior to the pandemic. \u201cPlease do note that this is (in a lot of cases) significantly more strict and out of its mind than many teams operated under pre-COVID,\u201d one Amazon employee wrote in an internal Slack channel, per a Business Insider report. \u201cI\u2019m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,\u201d an Amazon Web Services engineer wrote on LinkedIn, donning an \u201c#opentowork\u201d halo around his profile picture.\nReturn-to-office or \u201cRTO\u201d mandates are near-uniformly unpopular with employees. But the nitty-gritty of RTO mandates are particularly fraught for women\u2014mothers in particular, who most often bear the brunt of caregiving and household upkeep.\nNearly two-thirds of C-suite leaders whose companies have mandated an office return say the policy has led a disproportionate number of women to quit, as Kelly Monahan, who directs research at freelancing platform Upwork, told Fortune over the summer. There\u2019s not even an upside for the boss; more than half of executives told Upwork that losing female employees ended up tanking company productivity\u2014the very thing mandates are supposedly designed to boost.\nNearly nine in 10 women, per a survey by International Workplace Group, believe flexible work is an equalizer; two-thirds say such an arrangement lessens the biases they face. Almost 75% of women said they\u2019d instantly look for a new job if their employer removed their hybrid work plans.\nWomen\u2019s day-to-day work experience remains largely unexamined, Annie Dean, workplace futurist and head of Team Anywhere at workplace software firm Atlassian tells Fortune. \u201cThere are \u2018pinch points\u2019 in various phases of life, especially for working mothers, when the ability to commute and spend the majority of waking hours in an office is impractical,\u201d she added. \u201cBut this in no way impacts a woman\u2019s ability to do her highest-level work.\u201d\nTo be sure, in-person work is valuable, insofar as it fosters collaboration, idea exchange, and simply getting to know the people one works with day in, day out. But, research has proven time and again, that same value can be fostered without compulsory daily attendance. In fact, Dean points out, daily office attendance, when compared with just a handful of days per week or month in person, actually negatively impacts business performance.\u00a0Dean calls choices like Amazon\u2019s \u201cespecially egregious.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that correlates higher in-office time with better performance; in fact it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d Monahan notes. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you have to be 100% remote\u2014and women aren\u2019t always asking for that\u2014just time for life outside of work.\u201d\nJane Thierjane.thier@fortune.com\nThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

The stock price of the chipmaker that is famous for selling AI GPUs has surged significantly in the past two years. After tripling in 2023, NVIDIA shares are up another 140% in 2024, pushing the market valuation of the firm close to $3 trillion. Analysts, like those at Bank of America, have increased their price target on the shares to around $1,500, citing the potential of NVIDIA to drive AI growth for years to come. Bank of America analysts believe the conversion of global data centers to AI-accelerated computing could require up to $500 billion annually, with NVIDIA playing a key role in this transformation\u200b.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nProminent investment firms appreciate the significance of emerging AI trends. According to a report by Financial Times, investment titan Blackrock is exploring the launch of an AI-focused fund, in collaboration with tech powerhouse Microsoft and MGX, an investment firm based in Abu Dhabi. The primary aims of this fund are likely to include focus on creating data centers and funding energy infrastructure to support AI growth. NVIDIA is assisting Blackrock with estimating energy demands for new AI technologies. Analysts have forecast that energy constraints could be a potential roadblock to faster AI adoption. BlackRock will launch the fund with Global Infrastructure Partners, a firm it bought back in January for $12.5 billion.\nThe AI hype is truly global. Tech giant Amazon recently announced that it would invest \u00a38 billion in the United Kingdom over the next five years as part of a major push to expand data center infrastructure across the country. Amazon rivals like Google and Microsoft have also previously announced plans to boost data center infrastructure in the UK. The former plans to invest $1 billion in the UK while the latter has confirmed around \u00a32.5 billion to expand AI growth. Experts have stressed that AI is not just a short-term trend but a long-term transformative force. Francisco Bido, a top portfolio manager, recently underlined that AI was not a fad, noting the significant impact it had on both the top and bottom lines of many companies.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

The company recently announced a string of measures that aim to ease investor concerns around the finances and technological prowess in the AI domain. The company revealed that it had struck a deal with tech giant Amazon to manufacture AI chips under a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar framework, starting with a custom artificial intelligence fabric chip utilizing the 18A foundry process technology. Under the deal, Intel will also create custom Xeon 6 chips using the Intel 3 node for Amazon Web Services.\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Pat Gelsinger has commented on the deal, noting that the expansion of a longtime relationship with AWS reflected the strength of the process technology of the chipmaker that delivered differentiated solutions for customer workloads. The CEO added that chip design and manufacturing capabilities, combined with the comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud, AI and machine learning services of AWS, would unleash innovation across the shared ecosystem and support the growth of both businesses, as well as a sustainable domestic AI supply chain.\nOverall INTC ranks 16th on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of INTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than INTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "It\u2019s been just a week since Amazon\u2019s CEO Andy Jassy told his workforce that they will have to return to working in an office five days a week\u2014and already, 73% of Amazon workers are considering quitting in response.\nThat\u2019s at least according to the anonymous job review site Blind, which polled 2,585 verified Amazon professionals one day after Jassy sent out the RTO memo.\nAlthough employees at the $1.9 trillion tech giant have until January 2025 before they\u2019ll be expected to show face at one of Amazon\u2019s many offices, the data highlights that many are hoping to find a new job before the new year.\nThe majority of corporate Amazon employees reported that they\u2019re not happy with the mandate and are looking for new jobs\u2014or know someone on their team who is.\nWhat\u2019s more, over a third said that they know someone at the company who has handed their resignation in because of the announcement.\nFortune similarly found in its own investigation that employees are \u201crage applying\u201d for new jobs and already interviewing for more flexible roles elsewhere.\nAmazon didn't respond to Fortune's request for comment.\nOver 90% of Amazon\u2019s workers are \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the company\u2019s new in-office policy, according to the Blind poll, and many posted on Blind about their fears that it will inspire other tech giants to follow suit.\n\u201cRemote is a thing of the past\u2026\u201d a verified Block professional wrote on Blind. \u201cAmazon will not do this unless they know their peers aren\u2019t going to do something similar in the future.\u201d\n\u201cOther companies are gonna do this, enjoy wfh while it lasts people,\u201d a Google worker echoed.\n\u201cPack it up boys, it\u2019s over,\u201d an AT&T employee added. \u201cAll tech going to follow and be 5 days a week now.\u201d\nIndeed, since Amazon announced it\u2019s summoning workers back to the old ways of working, computer maker Dell has similarly demanded that its sales staff come into the office five days a week\u2014up from three.\nHowever, research consistently shows that companies with strict in-office mandates, like Amazon and now Dell, are actually exceptions to the norm.\nIn reality, most businesses are becoming more\u2014not less\u2014flexible and have even recently backtracked on their stance around working from home.\nFlex Index analyzed office requirements at more than 9,000 companies (who collectively employ more than 100 million people) and found that around half of U.S. firms asked workers to return to the office last January.\nOnly a third have kept their strict five-day in-office mandates in place.\nNow 37% of employers offer hybrid working instead\u2014up from 20% at the start of 2023.\nSeparate research has echoed that CEOs in the tech industry especially have spent the last year backtracking on their RTO mandates.\nJust 3% of tech firms are now asking their workers to go into the office full-time\u2014a significant drop from 8% last year\u2014after experiencing more resistance than they had anticipated.\nAmazon could suffer the same fate: According to Blind\u2019s report, in addition to a potential mass exodus of current employees, Amazon's hiring managers are already struggling to recruit because of the new mandate.\nA verified Microsoft professional who claims to be interviewing for a job at the company revealed that \u201cthousands of candidates are dropping out of Amazon\u2019s recruitment process.\u201d\nNow, they say, Amazon's recruiters are \u201cblowing up\u201d their phone and trying to pin down an interview date.\n\u201cI just asked the recruiter why they are rushing to hire and he said the hiring managers are pissed that so many candidates dropped out of the pipeline in just the last 24 hours.\n\u201cIf you doubt that people would turn down an Amazon offer in a recession, remember that most candidates are still employed and likely working [remotely]\u2026\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Roche Holding AG RHHBY, GE Aerospace GE, Canterbury Park Holding Corp. CPHC and NVE Corp. NVEC.\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc., Roche Holding AG \u00a0and GE Aerospace, as well as two micro-cap stocks Canterbury Park Holding Corp. and NVE Corp. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\nAmazon.com shares have lost ground lately, along with the rest of its Magnificent 7 peers and other megacap Tech operators, but they have still been strong performers this year (up +13.7% vs. +15.3% for the S&P 500 index. The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive.\nAmazon.com\u2019s expanding global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses, remain a plus. Growing adoption of AWS is aiding Amazon\u2019s cloud dominance. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Also, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings are tailwinds. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives.\nHowever, macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Amazon issued weak third-quarter 2024 revenue guidance due to the changing shopping pattern of consumers, which is a negative.\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\nShares of Roche have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past three months (+22.0% vs. +4.1%). The company's performance in the second quarter and the first half of 2024 was impressive because of the high demand for its drugs and tests.\nThe second quarter saw an acceleration in growth as total sales were no longer affected by the decline in COVID-19 sales, resulting in very strong sales growth. Consequently, Roche raised its earnings outlook for the full year. Vabysmo, Ocrevus, Evrysdi and Polivy boost growth. Vabysmo has put up a stellar performance against Eylea.\nMeanwhile, Roche is also looking to diversify and make inroads in the lucrative obesity market in the wake of declining sales from legacy drugs due to competition from biosimilars. The company\u2019s efforts to develop new drugs are encouraging. The base diagnostics business is also performing well.\n(You can read the full research report on Roche here >>>)\nShares of GE Aerospace have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry over the past six months (+25.1% vs. +7.7%). The company has been witnessing strength in its businesses, driven by robust demand for commercial engines, propulsion and additive technologies.\nRising U.S. & international defense budgets, geopolitical tensions, positive airline & airframer dynamics and robust demand for commercial air travel augur well for the company. GE Aerospace remains committed to making investments to boost growth and provide better services to its customers.\nIts portfolio-reshaping actions are likely to unlock values for its shareholders. Its shareholder-friendly policies are encouraging. For 2024, it expects organic revenues to grow in the high-single-digit range from the year-ago level. However, it has been dealing with high costs and expenses related to projects and restructuring activities.\n(You can read the full research report on GE here >>>)\nCanterbury Park\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Gaming industry over the year-to-date period (-0.6% vs. +6.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $100.78 million offers significant long-term revenue potential through diversified projects like an amphitheater, Winners Circle and residential units, driving growth beyond traditional gaming.\nFinancially stable with $24 million in cash and short-term investments, Canterbury Park can fund growth without debt. Improved EBITDA margins and diversified revenue streams, including pari-mutuel wagering and event hosting, support CPHC\u2019s earnings stability. The company\u2019s vision of a regional destination is progressing, with leasing success indicating solid demand.\nHowever, risks include a 93.6% drop in second-quarter 2024 net income due to a non-recurring gain in 2023, weak casino revenues and substantial losses from equity investments. Increased competition from nearby casinos could impact market share and profitability.\n(You can read the full research report on Canterbury Park here >>>)\nShares of NVE have gained +0.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry\u2019s gain of +16.2%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $367.89 million exhibits strong margins in the fiscal first quarter of 2025, with gross margin rising to 86% and operating margin at 65%, driven by a profitable product mix and direct sales.\nThe company's increased R&D spending by 26%, especially in wafer-level chip scale packaging aimed at medical and industrial applications, expected to drive new revenue streams. Despite a 24% sales decline due to semiconductor downturns, strong cash flows and a $53 million cash reserve support a steady $1.00 per share dividend. NVE Corporation's focus on spintronic technologies positions it well in high-growth sectors.\nHowever, revenue risks persist with heavy reliance on key customers and competitive pressures. Rising operating expenses and labor market challenges may pressure near-term profitability, while supply-chain vulnerabilities and inventory management issues could impact operational efficiency.\n(You can read the full research report on NVE here >>>)\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": " Madison Mills    \u00b7 Host and Reporter",
        "Text": "After more than a decade of competition, Amazon Web Services (AMZN) is changing course on Oracle (ORCL).\nOn Monday, AWS announced a partnership with Oracle that will allow customers to access Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle Exadata Database Service within AWS, making it easier for customers to integrate data and manage databases.\nThe partnership is a marriage of former foes. Oracle Database@AWS marks a pivot in the longstanding competitive relationship between the two companies.\n\"Hell hath frozen over,\" Patrick Moorhead, CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told Yahoo Finance about the partnership. \"These two companies have been essentially at war with each other since AWS was formed 15 years ago, and AWS's thesis before this was they were going to take out Oracle ... and they would use their database. ... What's clear today ... was that Oracle database is very much alive and well.\"\nOracle stock jumped 12% in early trading Thursday on the news, while Amazon stock rose 2%.\nAWS CEO Matt Garman spoke to Yahoo Finance about the partnership at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communicopia and Technology Conference on Monday. According to Garman, who is three months into his CEO role at AWS, \"We've always wanted to have a broad set of offerings for customers, ... [and] customers do like running on Oracle databases.\"\n\"We thought about how integrating AI services into Oracle databases would work,\" Garman said (video above). \"It took us a while to get there, but I do think it's a partnership that strongly benefits customers, and that's something that's good for AWS. It's good for Oracle.\"\nThe partnership is certainly a shift. As of Thursday, AWS and Oracle still had blog posts on their websites highlighting challenges and complaints about each other's services. For instance, AWS pointed out complaints about Oracle's \"non-standardized systems\" and \"jaw-dropping\" price increases, while Oracle charged that AWS has complex pricing models and less flexible offerings.\nMoorhead noted that the deal is particularly bullish for Oracle stock.\n\"Cloud isn\u2019t winner take all and this is a perfect example that it takes a village,\" Moorhead said. \"The most sophisticated investors now see the durability of Oracle database in the cloud. \u2026 This event will see more bulls come out.\"\nThis partnership also reflects a broader strategy from AWS amid an AI boom that has left tech giants scrambling to be the first and have the best large language model, something Garman said he's not concerned about.\n\"There\u2019s not going to be one model thats going to rule them all,\" Garman said. \"We like to partner, not necessarily compete.\"\nThe strategy has AWS on track for $105 billion in annual revenue, and the stock is currently outpacing the Nasdaq year to date.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. is raising the pay of its hourly warehouse workers by at least $1.50 an hour and adding Prime memberships to their benefits.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUnlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad\nThe Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America\u2019s Roads\nBelfast\u2019s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland\u2019s Public Transport\nThe raises will take effect this month for the hundreds of thousands of employees working for Amazon\u2019s sprawling US logistics operation, boosting the average base wage to more than $22 an hour, the company said in a blog post on Wednesday. The pay bump comes as inflation, though well below its post-pandemic highs, continues to eat away at the value of workers\u2019 paychecks.\nEmployees will start receiving Prime, Amazon\u2019s speedy shipping and video subscription service, as part of their compensation beginning early next year, the company said. The additional investment in pay and benefits, $2.2 billion, is the company\u2019s largest, logistics chief Udit Madan said in the blog.\nThe Seattle-based company tends to announce pay tweaks and seasonal hiring goals ahead of the holiday shopping rush. Last year, Amazon said it would spend $1.3 billion boosting worker wages and benefits.\nAmazon\u2019s pay rates tend to fall between those of physical retailers \u2014 the source of many Amazon recruits \u2014 and higher-skilled work in the logistics industry. Walmart Inc.-owned Sam\u2019s Club this week said starting wages would increase by $1, to $16 an hour. Costco Wholesale Corp. raised its starting wage for US workers to $19.50 in July.\nAmazon is the second largest private-sector employer in the US, trailing only Walmart. In a survey of Amazon warehouse workers conducted by researchers last year, about half reported struggling to afford enough food or a place to live.

        "Author": "  Orianna Rosa Royle ",
        "Text": "Amazon is making its employees go back to the office five days a week from January\u2014sparking global panic among professionals that their employer may do the same. But really, research suggests that the tech giant\u2019s CEO Andy Jassy could backtrack on the toughened stance soon.\nFlex Index analyzed office requirements at more than 9,000 companies (who collectively, employ more than 100 million people) and found that around half of U.S. firms asked workers to return to the office last January.\nYet, only a third have kept their strict five-day in-office mandates in place.\nNow, 37% of employers offer hybrid working instead\u2014up from 20% at the start of 2023.\nDespite the increase in headlines around firms forcing their workers back to their desks, companies like Amazon are actually exceptions to the norm.\u00a0In fact, the data shows that workplace location flexibility is generally on the rise.\nAlthough 50% of businesses were already offering their employers some flexibility over where they work last year, that\u2019s now increased to 69%.\nAs one worker consoled disgruntled Amazon employees on Reddit: \u201cMy company got real strict about RTO last year insisting on 3 days in the office and laying off fully remote workers. 9 months later they have dropped the policy.\u201d\nThey make a valid point: Separate research has echoed that CEOs in the tech industry especially have spent the last year backtracking on their RTO mandates.\nJust 3% of tech firms are now asking their workers to go into the office full-time\u2014a significant drop from 8% last year.\nAmazon\u2019s toughened RTO policy comes as bosses around the world grapple with staff defying their hybrid policy.\nIn London, employers are asking staff to come in to the office for 3.1 days a week on average\u2014employees are actually showing up only 2.7 days.\nLikewise, in New York workers are being asked to work from the office for 3.7 days of the week\u2014but are only showing up for 3.1 days.\nThe report from the think tank Centre for Cities highlighted that this pattern is followed in most major global cities, including Toronto, Singapore, and Sydney.\nAmazon is no stranger to RTO-defiant workers: Around 30,000 employees signed a petition protesting the company\u2019s three-day in-office mandate last year, and more than 1,800 pledged to walk out from their jobs to take a stand.\nSince then it has attempted to reassert its authority by giving managers the green light to fire employees who fail to show face in the office three days a week and asking remote workers to relocate near an office\u2014or resign.\nHowever, just two months ago, the tech giant was still complaining of workers dodging the three-day in-office mandate, over a year later.\n\u201cThe data shows clearly that many companies\u2014including Amazon\u2014set hybrid work mandates, knowing compliance will vary,\u201d Daan Van Rossum, author of the Future Work newsletter and founder of FlexOS tells Fortune.\n\u201cThey\u2019re playing a negotiation game, asking for five days to get three, as employees have grown used to the autonomy and productivity that hybrid work offers.\u201d\nUltimately, despite Jassy\u2019s call for workers to return to \u201cthe way we were before the onset of COVID,\u201d Daan Van Rossum highlights that \u201cin the pre-pandemic office, most people didn't show up 5 days a week. Even then, office occupancy was usually 70%.\u201d\n\u201cI expect a loosening of the policy as this public display of 'office nostalgia' versus the expected reality of offices\u2014that they will still be half-empty even after the mandate goes into effect\u2014will be visible to everyone.\u201d\nHas your firm gone back on its RTO policy?

        "Author": "  Jordan Valinsky, CNN ",
        "Text": "Amazon is taking a page out of Aldi and Target\u2019s playbook and launching a new line of budget-friendly food items in an attempt to attract price-conscious shoppers who are ditching name brands to save money.\nAmazon is rolling out a new \u201cno-frills\u201d private label brand called Amazon Saver, with most items priced at less than $5 and that include an array of household staples and pantry items such as cookies and crackers and perishable items like sliced turkey and ham. More than a hundred additional items will be revealed in the coming months.\nThe company has several private label food brands, including Amazon Fresh, 365 and Happy Belly, but Saver is the company\u2019s lowest priced brand, which \u201ccomplements the company\u2019s selection of private label brands designed to provide the best value for a range of grocery products,\u201d Amazon said in a statement.\nAmazon is also taking aim at its rivals, including Walmart, Target and Aldi, all of which have cheaply priced private label brands that are popular with customers, as retailers look to retain shoppers despite stubbornly high grocery prices.\nA few years of high inflation has forced customers to reevaluate their spending habits and made them prioritize value, especially in grocery shopping, since many similar items are sold at different prices depending on the brand.\n\u201cAmazon still has big ambitions in grocery, so it needs to jump on this bandwagon as well as sharpen its value for money position,\u201d said Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail. \u201cSaver products will help the business to accomplish this as it provides stronger opening price points.\u201d\nSaunders told CNN that it\u2019s vital that Saver has \u201creasonable quality,\u201d because shoppers \u201cdo not want cheap products; they want good products with low prices.\u201d\nShoppers have pulled back spending in the past year as costs have risen 20% to 30% higher than they were three years ago and as incomes failed to keep up, Sarah Wyeth, managing director, retail and consumer with S&P Global Ratings, previously told CNN.\nAmazon also said that starting Tuesday it would add more grocery discounts for Prime members, its $139 yearly membership program. Shoppers at its roughly 50 Amazon Fresh stores and online are getting price cuts on more than 3,000 items.\nTypically, Prime members get a 10% discount, but now they can get up to 50% off eight to 15 grocery items that change weekly, including fresh produce and meats. And more than 1,200 rotating grocery items from popular brands will be discounted 25%. Prime members will also get an additional 10% off its new lineup of Saver products.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Author": "  Meghan Hall ",
        "Text": "Amazon will soon close two of its California facilities, state records show.\nOn September 6, the company filed two notices under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act (WARN Act), noting that the closings will affect about 160 employees at each of the two facilities.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nAmancio Ortega's Journey from Fast-Fashion Tycoon to Logistics Kingpin\nCongresswoman Calls on eBay, Amazon, Facebook to Share Info on Stolen Goods\nAmazon Sues NLRB After Board Determines Delivery Partners Are Joint Employers\nOne of the facilities is a warehouse in West Sacramento, and the other is a facility in Irvine. The West Sacramento warehouse will lay off 159 employees, and the Irvine warehouse will part ways with 162 employees, WARN notice filings show.\u00a0Amazon plans to find new positions for all the employees affected by the changes.\nThe West Sacramento facility will close on October 30, and the Irvine facility will close just over a week later, on November 7.\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the company does not expect the decision to have any impact on its customers and noted that it closes older facilities, opens new sites and upgrades existing facilities according to its business needs at the time.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always evaluating our network to make sure it fits our business needs and to improve the experience for our employees, customers, and partners. As part of that effort, we\u2019ve decided not to renew the lease at our facilities in Irvine and West Sacramento, California,\u201d the spokesperson said via email. \u201cWe appreciate our team\u2019s hard work and commitment, and we\u2019re supporting impacted employees to find new opportunities within Amazon, including at nearby fulfillment sites.\u201d\nAnalysis from e-commerce and Fulfilled by Amazon partner AMZ Prep shows Amazon has over 200 fulfillment facilities in California alone\u2014by far the most in any state. For point of reference, AMZ Prep notes Amazon has nearly 90 fulfillment facilities in Texas and just over 60 in Florida.\nDespite its enormous footprint in the Golden State, the company has been pulling some operations out this year.\nIn April, the company announced it would end its Prime Air drone testing in Lockeford, Calif., while also placing a new Prime Air facility in Tolleson, Ariz., outside of Phoenix. Upon closing that facility, Amazon said it planned to offer its employees in Lockeford different positions in nearby Amazon facilities. West Sacramento and Lockeford are about 40 miles\u2014a 45-minute drive\u2014apart. Amazon did not confirm whether any employees from the Lockeford facility were displaced to West Sacramento.\nCalifornia is not the only state taking the heat when it comes to Amazon closures. In February, Amazon Air announced it would close a cargo-handling facility in San Antonio, Tex., resulting in 65 layoffs for employees of third-party contractor Worldwide Flight Services.\n"

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Amazon.com is raising the pay of its fulfillment and transportation staff in the United States by at least $1.50 an hour and handing out free Prime memberships as benefits, it said on Wednesday.\nThe company will spend over $2.2 billion on the hikes that will take the base salaries of hourly workers to more than $22 an hour, and more than $29 an hour including benefits.\nAmazon's decision comes as one of the biggest employers in the U.S. faces pressure from warehouse staff for better contracts and improved working conditions.\nIn June, the Amazon Labor Union - the first group of company workers to organize at a U.S. warehouse - voted to affiliate with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the largest U.S. labor unions.\nThe hikes will roll out starting this month and could help Amazon hire and retain staff as it heads into the key holiday season, typically the busiest shopping period of the year.\nThe Prime membership will be added to the benefits package early next year.\nAmazon employs more than 800,000 full-time and contract workers in the fulfillment and transportation roles in the U.S., according to the company. In 2018, it paid these workers a starting wage of $15 per hour.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Devika Syamnath)\n"

It identifies slang and terms associated with criminal activity and allows investigators to search for and categorize explicit images \u2013 lessening the volume of exposure to disturbing imagery and audio. With Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Pathfinder also makes data easily searchable as it scans and converts text from images and devices. Additionally, with Cellebrite Pathfinder's Automated Translation Services, law enforcement agencies can quickly overcome language barriers, gaining rapid access to critical data and insights from digital evidence in multiple languages.\nPathfinder in the Cloud with AWS, part of Cellebrite\u2019s Case-to-Closure (C2C) platform, helps agencies of all sizes eliminate both the need to purchase and maintain physical servers as well as the common reliance on dedicated server rooms and sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF) secure rooms. With this update, customers can now quickly scale storage and resources based on demand, while preserving resources as they only pay for what is needed.\nOther key capabilities of Pathfinder in the AWS cloud include:\nRapid Resource Commissioning: With the cloud, organizations can rapidly commission and decommission resources as needed, compared to the longer lead times for resource provisioning that traditional on-premises setups require.\nHigh Availability and Redundancy: Amazon VPC provides customers with high availability, uptime redundancy and failover capabilities with robust data security and business continuity, eliminating the need to invest in high-availability infrastructure.\nFlexible Infrastructure and Security and Compliance: Customers can tailor their infrastructure, security and compliance controls to align with their organization\u2019s requirements, all without the use of physical hardware.\n\u201cLaw enforcement agencies and public safety organizations stand to gain significantly from using investigative analytics solutions in the cloud,\u201d stated Cam Cowdery, Detective at the Nampa, Idaho Police Department and Member of the Treasure Valley Digital Forensic Task Force. \u201cMerging the adaptability of a secure virtual private cloud with Pathfinder\u2019s AI-driven analytical capabilities allows examiners, investigators and detectives to access evidence more swiftly and resolve cases more rapidly.\u201d\n\u201cAs digital evidence continues to increase in volume and complexity, it\u2019s critical that investigators have access to a secure and AI-powered cloud solution that meets their organization\u2019s requirements,\u201d said Ronnen Armon, Chief Products and Technologies Officer, Cellebrite. \u201cPathfinder leverages Amazon VPC to empower agencies to quickly and cost-effectively scale their resources and infrastructure to meet evolving needs and accelerate digital evidence analysis.\u201d\nTo learn more about Cellebrite Pathfinder, visit https://cellebrite.com/en/pathfinder/.\n###\nAbout Cellebrite\nCellebrite\u2019s (Nasdaq: CLBT) mission is to enable its customers to protect and save lives, accelerate justice and preserve privacy in communities around the world.

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been one of the biggest winners since the start of this millennium and has delivered stellar returns for long-term investors. On the other hand, the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant has actually been lagging behind the broader market in 2024.\nWhile Amazon stock has risen roughly 17.5% across this year's trading, the S&P 500 index has delivered a dividend-adjusted total return of 19.5% as of this writing.\nEven though Amazon has underperformed the benchmark index this year, investors shouldn't bet on that continuing to be the case over the long term. In fact, the stage appears to be set for the stock to deliver market-crushing returns over the next five years -- and artificial intelligence (AI) could be at the center of an incredible transformation.\nTake a look at the chart below, which tracks Amazon's quarterly operating margin over the last five years.\nAs the chart shows, the tech giant's operating margin has seen some big swings -- but it's trending in an encouraging direction. Some key macroeconomic pressures began easing in 2023, and performance across two quarters in 2024 seemingly has the company on track to record its highest-ever annual operating margin. There are good reasons to think that performance will continue to improve.\nDriven by the still growing, higher margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud services business, and the rapidly expanding -- and highly profitable -- digital advertising business, overall margins have expanded since 2023.\nWhile the e-commerce business still accounts for the majority of total sales, AWS and the digital ads business should continue to account for a growing portion of sales, helping push margins and overall profits higher. Even better, there's a good chance its massive online retail business will become significantly more profitable thanks to the rise of AI and robotics.\nDespite generating huge amounts of revenue, e-commerce is still a relatively low-margin business for Amazon. If automation meaningfully reduces costs for this segment, the company's earnings and share price should soar.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

Amazon denied any wrongdoing.\nOne of those sellers, Appario, which has since ceased to be a seller on Amazon, on Thursday challenged the CCI in the High Court in Karnataka state, saying the investigation report that names it must be \"set aside\", court records showed.\nNo further information on the grounds for the suit was immediately available.\nThe lawsuit marks the first legal challenge to the CCI investigation that started in 2020, and poses a major challenge to Amazon in India, a key market.\nAppario also said in the suit that a CCI order that asked it to submit its financial statements after the investigation was completed should be quashed, according to the court's records.\nAppario, Amazon and the competition regulator did not respond to requests for comment.\nAmazon maintained it does not give preferential treatment to any seller and complies with all laws, but said in October 2022 that Appario will within a year cease to list products on its website.\nThe Reuters investigation had found that Appario was internally referred to as a \"special\" merchant and received discounted fees and access to Amazon global retail tools used for things like inventory management.\nIn 2022, the CCI raided Appario and some other sellers as part of its investigations.\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra;Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)\n"

        "Author": "  Asra Isar ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the ChatGPT Stock Advice: 10 Recent Stock Recommendations.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks recommended by ChatGPT.\nChatGPT has quickly become an essential tool for both professional and personal use, thanks to its human-like responses. Analysts are also exploring its potential for stock picking, using criteria like low P/E ratios to find undervalued stocks. While some question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, a study from the University of Florida suggests that ChatGPT can predict stock price movements more accurately than some basic analysis models.\nOpenAI recently made a major leap by launching GPT-4o, a new AI model, alongside a desktop version of ChatGPT and an updated user interface. This update brings GPT-4 to all users, including those on the free tier, with enhanced speed and capabilities in text, video, and audio. The \"o\" in GPT-4o stands for \"omni,\" indicating its ability to support 50 languages and be available via APIs, allowing developers to start building applications with the new model right away.\nThe S&P 500 and NASDAQ are on track for their tenth consecutive positive session, driven by the same bullish factors that have propelled the market throughout the year. Inflation continues to trend downward, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. This potential for rate cuts supports the market by fostering conditions that could lead to a soft economic landing.\nEd Clissold, Ned Davis Research chief U.S. strategist, told CNBC that quarterly earnings growth has consistently accelerated over the past few quarters, with Q2 showing strong results and Q3 expected to follow suit. This steady growth suggests no significant changes in the underlying market thesis, keeping investor sentiment positive.\nDespite the recent volatility seen in August, which was partly driven by a spike in market uncertainty and liquidity issues, analysts do not expect this to carry over into September. The possibility of rate cuts by the Fed is providing a solid foundation for the market, though there are some concerns about elevated earnings estimates for Q3 and the upcoming election.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is close to an all-time high, with stocks like Travelers, Boeing, and 3M leading the charge. Analysts predict a broad market advance, with potential for catch-up in sectors that have lagged behind this year. As interest rates are likely to come down, the market rally could broaden beyond just AI and mega-cap growth stocks.\nLooking ahead to next week, key economic data will be in focus, including PCE data on Friday and consumer spending insights on Tuesday. Investors are hoping for \"Goldilocks\" economic data\u2014not too hot, not too cold\u2014that would confirm the Fed's rate cut path without signaling an economic downturn. The market favors moderate economic growth, which would support continued stock market gains.\nIn a world overwhelmed by information, ChatGPT offers a solution for investors. Its natural language processing capabilities allow it to sift through vast amounts of data and provide concise, actionable summaries, helping investors make informed decisions. By reducing information costs and democratizing financial knowledge, ChatGPT is becoming an invaluable tool for individual investors.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article we prompted ChatGPT multiple times to recommend stocks, based on the data as of its knowledge cutoff date. ChatGPT recommended 10 stocks based on \u00a0\u201chistorical trends\u201d and the \u201cmarket landscape\u201d from various sectors which have \u201csubstantial\u201d potential over the next few years. We shortlisted the stocks that were recommended the most and then further selected the ones that were the most widely held by hedge funds. We have sorted these stocks based on the number of hedge fund investors as of Q2 2024.\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon's stock recently plummeted following its disappointing third-quarter revenue guidance, prompting a significant market reaction. Despite this, Goldman Sachs tech analyst Sheridan has maintained a positive outlook on the company, even lowering his price target from $250 to $230. Sheridan argues that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is reaccelerating, largely driven by increased enterprise-level workload migration and growing AI workloads. He believes that AWS remains an undervalued asset within Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), especially considering its 19% growth rate and mid-30s GAAP operating income margin.\nInvestors fear that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) potentially overbuilding its cloud infrastructure may outpace demand. However, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a long-term growth potential, particularly as operating margins are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels. The current stock price, around $170, is relatively cheap given the anticipated earnings growth in the coming years.\nScott Devitt from Wedbush on CNBC, highlighted a $1 billion currency headwind that impacted the top line. While AWS exceeded expectations with a 19% growth rate, the company's advertising revenue underperformed, coming in at 19.5%, below the consensus of 22%. This underperformance contrasts with strong advertising results from other tech giants like Meta.\nWhile the disappointing advertising revenue is concerning, AWS's strong performance is a positive sign for Amazon's long-term growth. The stock's decline could be considered as a potential buying opportunity, especially given the strength in AWS. Analysts remain optimistic about the company's long-term prospects, particularly in the cloud and AI sectors. Investors are encouraged to focus on the bigger picture of sustained growth, rather than short-term fluctuations.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of ChatGPT's recent stock recommendations. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, heck out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

Beyond Prime Video, its linchpin service, Amazon also owns Freevee, its free, ad-supported streaming service, as well as Twitch, its popular live streaming platform.\nThe Information was the first to report the news.

The service costs $8.99 per month as a standalone app, and is also available to Prime members who pay the company $14.99 per month (or $139 per year) to get free shipping on products and other perks.\nAd sales are an increasingly important part of Amazon\u2019s video business. Starting next year, Amazon will streaming NBA games, as part of the league\u2019s recent $76 billion deal with the company, Disney, and NBC.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of Morgan Stanley's Best Stock Picks: 15 Stocks To Own For 2025.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Morgan Stanley's other stock picks.\nThe tail end of 2024 is seeing a market shift in the stock market as the Federal Reserve has finally signaled that interest rate cuts are on the horizon. This means that cheaper capital might be on the horizon, with the rate cuts coming just as the labor market starts to feel the pinch through lower growth.\nIt also means that consumer spending can pick up if economic output remains robust. For investors, it creates an opportunity to gain an early foothold into stocks that could benefit from the new environment. On this front, investment banks have been analyzing the situation diligently for quite some time.\nOne bank that's out with regular reports is Morgan Stanley. It releases monthly reports that cover the latest trends in the economy and the stock market. The bank's August report covered some recent trends. It shared that the labor market was one of its most closely watched economic indicators as it was \"vulnerable to a further deceleration in economic activity.\" To explain why, the bank shared that US excess labor supply, that is the demand minus supply, was at pre pandemic levels that had sustained since 2018. This implies that employers no longer have the incentive to offer lucrative pay packages to attract workers, which in turn leads to less money flowing into the economy to contribute to inflation.\nMS added that the three month national unemployment average was 0.5% above the 12 month average, which is a warning bell for the economy. This is because according to one of the most widely used recession indicators, the Sahm Rule, a recession has started once the rate is 0.5% or higher than the 12 month average. MS is not the only one that is ringing warning bells on this front, as JPM also confirmed in early August that the rule was triggered when the unemployment rate jumped to 4.3%. However, it did add that we \"do not think a recession is imminent\" and \"remain constructive on U.S. equities despite increased volatility, and see opportunity to lock in rates before they fall.\"\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\nReturning to MS, it also sees an opportunity in the battered commercial real estate market. It cites the commercial real estate cap rate, which is the rate of return based on its income generation capability, to argue that commercial real estate valuations are currently depressed enough to warrant an investment. The office real estate market had a cap rate of 9% in March 2024 as per MS, for a two percentage point and three percentage point lead over retail and residential real estate, respectively. As for the stock market, the bank shared in August that it still prefers large cap stocks (an important point as you'll find out when you check out the stocks in this piece).\nThe bank believes that small caps \"are lower in quality, more volatile and carry greater exposure to cyclical sectors relative to large cap,\" meaning that their outperformance \"requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates.\" MS warned that \"softer economic data may constrain\" small cap performance. In terms of data, it argues that small cap performance is dependent on bond yields. This data set shows that when we assume an index value of 100 for US small caps had led benchmark S&P stocks except the Magnificent 7 at a time when 10 year US bond yields were around 1.5% in July 2021, the indexed returns dropped to 90 in July 2023 when the yields were approximately 4.3%.\nAugust's final week was pivotal for the stock market as Fed Chair Jerome Powell finally signaled that the time for interest rates had come. \"The time has come for policy to adjust,\" stated Powell at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. \"The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\" he added.\nFollowing the Fed Chair's remarks, MS was out with its September report. Commenting on the economy, the bank shared that it does not \"believe the economy is set to accelerate over the next few months, which makes the S&P 500 around 5650 our near-term upper bound. At the same time, the economy is not collapsing, which makes 5200 attractive and 5350 seem fair. We plan to trade around the ranges.\" MS also shares key details for the unemployment rate, which are important when analyzed in tandem with the Sahm Rule. It comments that higher immigration \"may be supporting a higher labor force participation rate, which in turn would contribute to a higher reported unemployment rate. From this perspective, a higher unemployment rate is not signaling weakness but rather an increase in the labor supply that would help bring inflation down without affecting growth.\"\nSubsequently, the bank believes that the percentage of total unemployed accounted for by people who lost their jobs (Job Losers) and the number of total layoffs (Challenger Layoffs) might be more relevant when analyzing the labor market. Job Losers currently sit at 50%, while Challenger Layoffs are less than 50,000 after having jumped to 100,000. In short, this paints a more robust labor market picture that might not signal a recession as the Sahm Rule might have suggested.\nRemaining bearish on small caps, it believes that the \"window for small cap outperformance is too narrow \u2013 requiring \u201cGoldilocks\u201d growth and inflation.\" This sentiment is also echoed in the bank's Vintage Values 2025 stock report, where it comments that its strategists \"currently recommend avoiding small caps, and Vintage Values 2025 reflects that view. It skews heavily toward large-cap stocks: 80% of the names are classified as either mega-cap or large-cap.\" Mind you, this sentiment was also echoed in the 2024 report, verbatim.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of MS' top stocks for 2025, we ranked MS' Vintage Value 2025 stock picks by their share price percentage upside based on the bank's price target.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is an eCommerce and cloud computing company. This enables it to benefit from the sizeable nature of the eCommerce industry and the high growth, high margin, and recurring revenue offered through cloud computing. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) dominates the eCommerce market through its market share which saw it attract 3.25 billion users to its website in June. This also provides a wide moat to the firm in the advertising business, as merchants are eager to sell and advertise their products on its platform. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also enjoys key operating advantages, as evidenced by the click to door speed of just 1.9 days for the firm as opposed to 4.4 days for the industry. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s resources have also enabled it to establish a strong footing in the AI industry as it is one of the few firms with a foundational AI model. The firm is operating on all three layers of the AI stack, from designing semiconductors to providing a platform for businesses to develop AI products and services. \"Amazon\u2019s high-margin businesses continue to allow Amazon to drive greater profitability while still continuing to invest,\" believes Morgan Stanley. It adds that \"Advertising serves as a key area for both further growth potential and profitability flow-through.\"\nAlbyn Capital Management mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\"In his annual letter to shareholders, CEO Andy Jassy underscores Amazon's commitment to \"primitive services\" over the last 20 years \u2013 creating foundational building blocks that empower rapid development of higher level products and services. Examples include developing core functionalities like payments and search, which eventually led to the Fulfilled by Amazon service, or developing logistics infrastructure, which led to the Buy with Prime service. Amazon is adopting the same approach to the next front, GenAI, from custom AI chips and training/deployment services to empower companies to construct their own core GenAI models, to their Bedrock service which allows customers to use pre-existing models to more quickly develop applications, to Amazon developing their own applications for internal use (think Alexa and a new shopping AI called Rufus).\nOverall AMZN ranks 10th on our list of Morgan Stanley's best stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Greg Bensinger ",
        "Text": "By Greg Bensinger\n(Reuters) -Amazon.com will require employees to return to working at company offices five days per week beginning next year, toughening a prior three-day mandate.\nThe change is necessary to \"invent, collaborate and be connected\" wrote CEO Andy Jassy in a letter to employees on Monday posted to its website. He said the experience of a three-day mandate \"strengthened our conviction about the benefits\" of in-office work.\nCompanies have been allowing many employees to work from home since the pandemic, leaving downtown offices nearly empty in a number of cities such as San Francisco and Seattle. However, some tech firms are beginning to mandate employees to return to their offices two or three days per week.\nAmazon has taken a tougher stance than many of its rivals as COVID-19 has become less of a daily threat. Employees have described to Reuters how Amazon has required them to report to, in some cases, distant offices or move to Seattle to keep their jobs.\nAnd some employees who were consistently out of compliance with the existing three-day mandate were told they were \"voluntarily resigning,\" and were locked out of Amazon's systems. A spokesperson for Amazon did not immediately respond to say whether the new mandate will be as stringent, nor did an employee Q&A shared with Reuters on Monday make it clear.\nThe mandate has been deeply unpopular among a vocal group of employees who have said working from home is both effective and spares time and money for commuting. In May last year, workers at Amazon's Seattle headquarters staged a walkout protesting changes to the e-commerce giant's climate policy, layoffs and a return-to-office mandate.\nAs part of an organizational restructuring, Amazon is looking to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. In the Q&A, Amazon said some \"some organizations may identify roles that are no longer required\" without giving additional details.\nAmazon also is eliminating a prior program that allowed workers the option to work from anywhere for four months per year, according to the Q&A.\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger in San Francisco; Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru and Juby Babu in Mexico City; Editing by Alan Barona and Sandra Maler)\n"

        "Author": "  Chloe Berger ",
        "Text": "Laszlo Bock, consultant and former Google senior executive, likened Andy Jassy\u2019s demand that Amazon employees spend five days a week in the office to ordering the usual at a restaurant.\nSay the hamburger is your pick of choice at the regular joint and you all of a sudden go for the grilled chicken, Bock suggested. The chicken turns out to be okay, \u201cno better than the hamburger, it\u2019s no worse.\u201d Naturally, you\u2019ll revert back to the burger, or the norm.\n\u201cYou default back to what you\u2019re comfortable with,\u201d Bock told Fortune. The Gretel AI data platform cofounder is a corporate culture expert and was senior people exec at Google from 2006 to 2016, a period during which the tech giant was named Best Company to Work For dozens of times. \u201cWhy would you ever have the chicken sandwich again?\u201d he asked.\nIt\u2019s a classic tale of executives falling back into the familiar schedule of fully in-person work after five years of attempting or waffling on flexible, remote, or hybrid schedules. Joining the ranks this week was Amazon, as Jassy increased the mandated number of in-office days from three to five, in a note sent to employees on Monday. Amazon responded to requests for comment by referring Fortune to said memo.\nThe memo, posted on the company site, stressed the importance of in-person attendance as nourishment for company culture and collaboration. It also outlined changing the structure to reducer staff in management positions.\nBock called the move \u201ca triumph of traditional management over innovative management,\u201d explaining that the latter style is more difficult and needs more data to support its implementation.\nHybrid work can be a successful boost to productivity if managed well, said Bock, pointing to early studies, work from companies like Atlassian that host community events, and the success of employers implementing focal days. During the early days of the pandemic, productivity increased after companies put effort into their plans. In turn, employees responded positively to it, added Bock, author of the New York Times bestseller Work Rules!: Insights from Inside Google to Transform How You Live and Lead.\nYet to actually do hybrid work well requires resources, a clear plan, and above all, buy in. Most companies aren\u2019t looking to put in the effort without guaranteed results, therefore dampening the potential benefit of mixed-mode work. In the absence of an effective flexible schedule, hybrid work\u2019s cons became all the more clear\u2014 including a diffuse culture, feeling of disconnect, generic culture, and managers who don\u2019t feel in control, he said.\nRead more: Stop romanticizing in-office watercooler talk. As a fully distributed company of 12,000 people, here\u2019s what really works\n\u201cFrom a company perspective there is not clear, overwhelming evidence that this is good,\u201d Bock said And because it\u2019s such a change, executives need an evidence windfall to alter course. \u201cEmployees love it\u201d because it values their autonomy and freedom. But they lose out when employers, especially big ones like Amazon that struggle due to their size, pull out of hybrid plans.\nIn a sense companies fumbled the bag on hybrid work, giving up on a new strategy once it stopped being sexy enough. Or in other words, executives \u201ccreated a self fulfilling prophecy that is now dragging people back to the office kicking and screaming.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s announcement wasn\u2019t exactly met with open arms. Some employees expressed dismay and disapproval over the mandate, as one posted on Slack that it's a sign of \u201cgoing backwards,\u201d according to Business Insider.\nCompanies run the risk of losing out on top talent when they shirk flexibility, but Bock seems to think that Amazon isn\u2019t running a terrible gamble here. \u201cVery few people vote with their feet,\u201d he said, adding that the strategy likely won\u2019t hurt the company in the long run. Even though it\u2019s controversial and many remote or hybrid Amazonians are likely peeved, many won\u2019t leave, he noted. And successful companies will continue to have a large talent pool to draw from even if they are rolling out polarizing ultimatums, he said.\nAs for the new management strategy, Bock sees it as a way to pare micromanaging. It\u2019s a \u201cvery clear call for productivity, but it's also a call for managers focusing on actually making things work better,\u201d he said. He referenced Google\u2019s rule of seven, which didn't hire managers for teams with fewer than seven employees as to disperse their time and tamp down over involvement that could border on control.\nEven so, with all this change, he \u201cimagine[s] it's going to be a very stressful time for managers at Amazon.\u201d Despite getting flamed online, this isn\u2019t all that out of the ordinary for Amazon. It \u201creflects their values,\u201d as a tight organizational culture which is intense and is rooted in close management, he said.\nCalling the memo \"entirely expected and actually quite thoughtful,\" Bock praised their data-driven approach and added that many companies will likely follow suit. And this approach perhaps is better in the long-term as humans crave social connection and tend to lose that during poorly executed hybrid plans, he added.\nRather than simply issuing an edict like a banking CEO who simply sees RTO as important, Amazon is tying its mandate to internal data and culture, he explained Bock. While some companies tried to wait for the (still impending) downturn to get their in-office way and others went for the incremental \u201cboil the frog\u201d route, neither turned out all that effective\nBut Amazon will likely get its way.\u00a0 \u201cThey will force it...they\u2019ll make it happen,\u201d said Bock. He has \u201cno doubt they\u2019re going to measure it and monitor it\u201d and that\u00a0 \u201cthey're going to fire people for noncompliance.\u201d\nAnd more edicts might be forthcoming. Amazon is a sort of bellwether for others, and \u201call of tech has kind of moved in this direction,\u201d noted Bock. In other words, \u201cmost companies just don't put in the effort, and they just keep ordering the cheeseburger.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) is raising pay for its more than 800,000 US warehouse and transportation workers and giving them Amazon Prime for free.\nAmazon, one of the country\u2019s largest private employers, announced Wednesday that it will raise wages by at least $1.50 an hour, bringing the company\u2019s average starting wage to more than $22 an hour. Amazon will also offer the $139 yearly Prime benefit to employees for free.\nAmazon\u2019s decision to raise wages is another sign of a tight jobs market for logistics workers, fueled by more Americans shopping online. The labor market has cooled considerably during the past year, but the economy is still adding jobs.\nThe average hourly wage for transportation and warehouse workers rose to $30.79 in August, up 22% from August of 2020, according to the Labor Department. In July, more than 460,000 jobs were unfilled in the transportation and warehouse sector, the Labor Department said.\nRivals such as UPS, Walmart and Target have also bumped up wages for warehouse workers. UPS struck a five-year deal with the Teamsters union last year that included a jump in starting pay to $23 an hour during the contract.\nAmazon\u2019s wage hike comes ahead of the holiday season, typically the busiest online shopping stretch of the year. Sales are expected to climb by up to 3.3% this holiday stretch, Deloitte predicted in a report last week. Online sales will grow by up to 9%.\nAmazon has also faced intense scrutiny over safety and working conditions at warehouses.\nAn investigation by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee found Amazon\u2019s warehouses are especially dangerous for workers during the company\u2019s annual Prime Day event as well as the holiday season. The company\u2019s workers have repeatedly made headlines, with persistent complaints about the \u201cgrueling\u201d experience of racing around warehouses that can be the size of 28 football fields while the company tracks their every move.\nAmazon said Wednesday that it has made progress on worker safety. The company claims work-related injuries are down by 28% and serious injuries are down by 75% over the past five years.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Title": "Amazon Sent a Big Warning to Nvidia Shareholders. Is the AI Stock in Trouble?",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have surged 145% over the past year due to the semiconductor company's critical position in the artificial intelligence (AI) economy. Specifically, Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUS) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like training machine learning models and running artificial intelligence applications.\nEarlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported, \"Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%.\" Some analysts believe Nvidia controls as much as 95% of the AI chip market. But Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) recently issued a warning for Nvidia shareholders.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told analysts no single artificial intelligence chip will fit every use case, simply because companies and developers want optionality. \"You saw this several years ago when some companies tried to argue that TensorFlow will be the only machine learning framework that mattered, and then PyTorch and others overtook it,\" Jassy explained.\nNvidia consistently sets performance records at the MLPerf benchmarks, objective tests that measure how well AI systems perform training and inference tasks. But Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are also very expensive. Its H200 GPUs cost up to $40,000 each, and full server racks cost millions of dollars. Jassy believes there is robust demand for products between the two extremes, so Amazon is developing custom AI silicon.\n\"We have a deep partnership with Nvidia and the broadest selection of Nvidia instances available, but we've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance,\" Jassy told analysts. \"It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon. Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference.\"\nImportantly, Amazon has previous experience in developing custom chips. The company has been designing generalized central processing units (CPUs) called Graviton processors for several years. Those chips are based on Arm architecture, and they offer 30% to 40% better price performance versus the leading x86 processors from AMD and Intel, according to Jassy.\nAmazon has the same goal with its custom AI silicon. Trainium and Inferentia are not meant to challenge Nvidia GPUs on performance alone, but rather to provide customers with a cost-efficient alternative. Some companies would rather pay a premium for the fastest AI chips, but others would gladly use slower chips to save money.\nAmazon is not the only company that is designing custom silicon. Broadcom develops custom AI chips for Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms, and it won a third major customer earlier this year. The company has not named the customer, but Reuters identified it as TikTok parent ByteDance. Additionally, J.P. Morgan\u00a0analysts recently speculated that Broadcom has also secured a contract to build custom AI chips for OpenAI, bringing its total to four major customers.\nJoseph Moore at Morgan Stanley expects that trend to continue. \"Hyperscalers, including Amazon, Google, and Meta, use custom silicon for their data centers due to cost and energy constraints in AI computing. As hyperscalers continue to invest in AI infrastructure, we expect increased demand for energy-efficient and cost optimizing custom chips to outpace the growth of general-purpose GPUs,\" he wrote in a note to clients.\nHere's the big picture: While Nvidia dominates the AI processor market today, input from Amazon and Morgan Stanley indicates the company is virtually guaranteed to lose market share in the years ahead. That does not mean Nvidia will lose its leadership position in the AI chip market. I doubt that will happen. But some spending will inevitably be redirected away from expensive Nvidia GPUs as more cost-efficient alternatives are made available.\nAdditionally, Nvidia will probably lose some pricing power as it fights to maintain its market share. Indeed, the company's gross margin declined 330 basis points sequentially in the most recent quarter, despite reporting 122% revenue growth on strong demand for its AI chips. Investors should expect that trend to continue in the coming quarters.\nHowever, Nvidia is not necessarily a bad investment. In fact, Wall Street still expects its earnings to increase at 37% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 56 times earnings look reasonable. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.5, which is well below the three-year average of 3.1.\nPersonally, I think investors looking to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom should have a position in Nvidia, and I am not alone. A recent note from Jim Kelleher at Argus reads, \"We believe that most technology investors should own [Nvidia] in the age of deep learning, AI, and GPU-driven application acceleration.\"\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Not only is it against free and fair competition but also against the interest of consumers,\" CCI's additional director general G.V. Siva Prasad wrote in the Amazon and Flipkart reports, in identical findings.\nReuters is first to report the smartphone companies have been accused of anticompetitive behavior in the CCI's reports which are dated Aug. 9 and are not public.\nXiaomi declined to comment, while the other smartphone makers did not respond to requests for comment.\nAmazon, Flipkart and the CCI did not respond, and have not so far commented on the reports' findings.\nBoth the CCI reports said that during investigations Amazon and Flipkart \"deliberately downplayed\" allegations of exclusive launches, but officials found the practice was \"rampant\".\nCounterpoint Research data shows that South Korea's Samsung and China's Xiaomi are two of India's biggest smartphone players, together holding an almost 36% market share, with China's Vivo on 19%.\nIndia's e-retail market is set to exceed $160 billion by 2028, up from $57-60 billion in 2023, consultancy firm Bain estimates.\nThe investigation findings are a major setback for Amazon and Flipkart in a key growth market where they have faced the ire of small retailers for years for hurting their offline businesses.\nThe CCI has also said both companies used their foreign investments to provide subsidised rates for services like warehousing and marketing to a select number of sellers.\nONLINE SALES BOOM\nSome of the smartphone companies - Xiaomi, Samsung, OnePlus, Realme and Motorola - have been ordered to submit their financial statements for three fiscal years to 2024, certified by their auditor, to the CCI, according to an internal CCI document dated Aug. 28, also seen by Reuters.\nThe investigation into Amazon, Flipkart and their sellers was triggered in 2020 by a complaint from an affiliate of the country's biggest retailer association, the Confederation of All India Traders, which has 80 million members.\nThe CCI will in coming weeks review any objections to its findings from Amazon, Flipkart, the retailer association, and the smartphone companies, and could potentially impose fines along with mandating companies to change their business practices, people familiar with the matter said.\nIndian retailers have repeatedly accused Amazon and Flipkart, and smartphone companies, of exclusive phone launches online, saying shopkeepers suffered as they didn't get the latest models and customers looked for them on the shopping websites.\n\"Exclusive launches had not only severely affected the ordinary sellers on the platform but also the brick-and-mortar retailers who were provided mobile phones at a much later date,\" both CCI reports said, citing analyses of data from smartphone companies.\nIndian research firm Datum Intelligence estimates that 50% of phone sales were online last year, up from 14.5% in 2013.

To that point, its\u00a0notable that their Zacks Internet-Commerce Industry is currently in the top 27% of over 250 Zacks industries.\n\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nDiving into the outlook for these retail leaders, Amazon\u2019s growth trajectory is more compelling with annual earnings now expected to climb 63% in fiscal 2024 to $4.74 per share versus EPS of $2.90 in FY23. Plus, FY25 EPS is projected to pop another 23%.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has largely attributed to the tech behemoths' expansion as Amazon's total sales are forecasted to increase more than 10% in FY24 and FY25 with projections edging toward $700 billion. As the world\u2019s largest cloud provider, Amazon\u2019s AWS segment sales increased 18% during Q2 to $26.28 billion.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlibaba has diverse operations outside of its e-commerce business as well which also includes cloud computing but the company\u2019s earnings growth has slowed in recent years. \nAlready in its FY25, Alibaba\u2019s EPS is expected to be up roughly 1% in its current fiscal year and is slated to be virtually flat in FY26 with projections at $8.74 per share.\u00a0However, Alibaba\u2019s top line is projected to expand 7% in FY25 and FY26 with forecasts edging toward $150 billion in annual sales.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nDespite Amazon's more attractive growth trajectory, value investors may be more drawn to Alibaba\u2019s stock. Amid the recent rally BABA still trades at just 10.9X forward earnings and at a significant discount to the industry average of 28.7X. \nIn contrast, AMZN is at a 40.5X forward earnings multiple which is also a noticeable premium to the S&P 500\u2019s 24.2X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFurthermore, BABA trades at less than 2X sales with AMZN at 3.1X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRegarding the balance sheet, Amazon had $89 billion in cash & equivalents at the end of Q2 2024 compared to Alibaba\u2019s $68 billion.\nAmazon\u2019s total assets stood at $554.81 billion with $318.37 billion in total liabilities.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nEqually as impressive, Alibaba has $245.63 billion in total assets compared to $102.18 billion in total liabilities.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAt the moment, Alibaba and Amazon\u2019s stock land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It\u2019s easy to see how growth investors may favor Amazon while value investors may be more inclined to choose Alibaba\u2019s stock.

The timing couldn\u2019t be better as it gives Intel another opportunity to regain its footing as a major chip manufacturer after drastically losing market share to Nvidia\u00a0NVDA\u00a0and AMD\u00a0AMD.\nThis may also quiet fears of Intel being able to preserve enough cash and gateways to growth to support the costly operations of its foundry business as a chip producer for other companies. These concerns have largely loomed despite Intel having $29.27 billion in cash & equivalents at the end of Q2 2024 and $206.2 billion in total assets compared to $85.77 billion in total liabilities.\nHowever, Intel\u2019s sales and operating performance have steeply contracted in recent years although a modest rebound is expected in fiscal 2025.

The company has not given details of its plans.\nAmazon's Head of Marketplace for Sub-Saharan Africa, Suzelle Abe, hinted at a gradual approach, telling potential sellers at an e-commerce conference in Johannesburg that the retailer would keep building its online store with more categories and sellers.\n\"We want to get to know the customers. We want to get to know a lot of important learnings and through that, we keep on building,\" Abe said.\n\"And yes, we're definitely here for the long run.\"\nThe retailer, which made South Africa its 23rd launch country, recently added jewellery and luggage to its growing list of categories, Abe added, with more to come.\nAmazon has two fulfilment centres in South Africa, one in Johannesburg and one in Cape Town, and has partnered with click-and-collect companies such as Pargo and home courier companies for last-mile delivery.\nApart from Takealot.com and local retailers, Amazon is also competing with U.S. retail giant Walmart Inc, which owns food and general merchandise group Massmart, and low-price fast-fashion sites Shein and Temu, which have disrupted South Africa's discount fashion market.\n(Reporting by Nqobile Dludla; Editing by Mark Potter)\n"

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The biggest driver of the market rally since early last year has been the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's largest companies have been investing heavily to stake their claim in the resulting windfall. However, lurking just behind the scenes are concerns about the state of the broader economy and what it might mean for the short-term direction of the stock market.\nWith that as a backdrop, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) was off 2.8%, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) fell 3.3%, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) tumbled 3.6%, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) slumped 6.8% as of 3:10 p.m. ET.\nTo be clear, there was nothing in the way of company-specific news driving these so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower today. This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to a report that suggested the broader economy was slowing faster than expected.\nThe monthly jobs report, courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that total nonfarm payrolls increased by 142,000 during the month of August, up from 89,000 in July, but well below economists' forecasts of 161,000. The unemployment rate came in as expected at 4.2%.\nAt first glance, this would appear to be good news. A weakening jobs picture suggests the economy is slowing, which makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will begin to cut interest rates next month. Thus far, the Fed has been reluctant to reduce rates until it was certain that it was winning its battle against a red-hot economy that was accompanied by relentless inflation.\nThe headline numbers show growth is slowing, which gives the Fed cover to begin its long-awaited rate cuts. However, the devil is in the details, and other revelations in the report gave investors pause.\nOne of the more troubling factors was the speed at which the labor market has been weakening. The government released revised figures for the months of June and July, showing 86,000 fewer jobs were created over those two months than originally believed.\nThe Fed has been trying to slow rampant inflation without tipping the economy into a recession, thereby engineering a so-called \"soft landing.\" The evidence thus far has suggested the Fed was on track to achieve this lofty goal, but the downward job revisions show the economy is cooling faster than originally believed. That increases the likelihood -- however remote \u2013- that a recession could still occur.\nAs recently as July, the major market indexes were regularly tapping new all-time highs, but some investors see the worsening jobs picture as a warning bell and are taking profits as a cautionary measure.\nSo, what does this have to do with Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla? The common thread that weaves the Magnificent Seven collective together is their potential to exploit AI. Each of these companies has been spending heavily to establish a beachhead in the AI revolution -- and it's easy to understand why.\nEstimates vary wildly, but one of the more conservative takes suggests the market for generative AI could be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\nThis will represent a veritable windfall for businesses at the cutting edge of this technology. However, many smaller companies have been reluctant to invest in new and emerging technology until the economy is stabilized, and today's mixed data did little to provide those assurances.\nYet the future looks bright for our Magnificent Seven companies:\nAmazon and Alphabet are two of the \"Big Three\" cloud infrastructure providers and, as such, are well positioned to provide AI services to their cloud customers, reaping the financial rewards.\nMeta Platforms collected reams of data from the billions of users on its social media platforms to develop its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which the major cloud providers pay to offer on their platforms.\nTesla has been working for years to perfect its Full Self Driving (FSD) technology, which is fueled by AI. The company recently announced that it will launch FSD in Europe and China as early as next year, thanks to the latest developments in AI.\nFinally, there's the matter of valuation to consider, and not all Magnificent Seven stocks are created equal. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are currently selling for 20 times and 24 times forward earnings, extremely attractive multiples, particularly in light of the opportunity. Amazon stock is selling for less than 3 times sales, which is also an appealing price. Tesla stock is expensive no matter how you slice it, at 90 times forward earnings and 7 times sales, so it isn't for every investor.\nThat said, if Tesla is the first to crack the code for self-driving cars, its current valuation may end up being meaningless.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "How AWS's AI Surge Boosts Amazon",
        "Author": "  Yiannis Zourmpanos ",
        "Text": "Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), or AWS, recorded very strong growth in Q2 2024, bolstered by robust demand for AI services and sustained migration away from traditional infrastructure to the cloud.\nWhile companies are modernizing their operations, AWS continues to reap the benefit accruing from this trend, thus finding its place in one of the leading positions among cloud providers. \nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nWith growing AI capabilities and strategic partnerships, AWS is in a position to drive the overall growth of Amazon and reinforce its competitive edge in the market.\nAWS continues to derive high top-line growth for Amazon. In Q2 2024, AWS top-line growth accelerated to 18.8%, up from 17.2% in Q1. This acceleration in growth emerged from several macro trends. Companies are increasingly moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. \nAdditionally, this shift will continue, with AWS benefiting from the increasing IT spending transitioning to cloud solutions. Many companies have completed their initial cost optimization efforts and are now focusing on modernizing their infrastructure. Hence, this modernization will derive more vital cloud adoption, contributing to AWS's growth.\nMoreover, AWS's AI and machine learning (ML) services are seeing dramatic growth. The demand for AI capabilities is driving a multi-billion dollar revenue run rate. This is reflecting strong client interest and adoption of AWS's AI services. AWS's ability to leverage its broad functionality, strong security features, and extensive partner ecosystem positions it as the preferred cloud provider.\n \nIn Q2 2024, AWS showcased robust growth in the global cloud infrastructure services market. Global spending in this sector increased by 19% year over year, reaching $78.2 billion. AWS, along with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Cloudthe top three vendorscollectively grew by 24%, now accounting for 63% of total market spending. Specifically, AWS's sales rose by 19%, marking a notable acceleration compared to the previous quarter.\nSource: Amazon\nThis is highly driven by enterprises boosting their IT budgets in areas related to AI. Of course, other providers own over a third of the global cloud market. Still, the trend shows movement to these big hyperscalers, including AWS, with market share increasingly captured due to their advanced capability and wide service offerings. \nAnother important highlight is that the historical estimates of Canalys from cloud infrastructure services revenue have been revised thanks to an extensive review. Thus, this revision affected the market shares from Q1 2022 to Q1 2024 and did not alter the overall rankings and growth rates from the previous reports that confirmed AWS's solid and consistent position in the market.\nSource: Canalys\nAdding AI to AWS's offerings has helped build up Amazon's advertising capability, which testified to its substantial growth in ad revenue that neared major key milestones each year by increasing.\nAmazon increased the value of its advertising platform by using AI to promptly improve ad targeting, personalization, and analytics. This drew a more diverse set of advertisers into its fold, who began to invest more in the platform. The interaction of AWS's AI innovations and advertising strengthened the top-line growth and Amazon's position in the digital advertising market.\nMoreover, AWS's AI capabilities capture new channels to advertise through support for video and voice ads by Amazon Prime Video and Alexa devices. This expansion gives Amazon greater reach and consumer engagement, but it also unlocks new revenue sources because more advertisers want to take advantage of its advanced advertising capabilities.\nIt's important to note that AWS's AI innovations extend beyond advertising, impacting other areas of Amazon's business. In e-commerce, for instance, AI will enhance inventory management and supply chain logistics, leading to improved customer service and cost reduction.\nLooking ahead, AWS's AI is set to play a disproportionately critical role in driving future ad revenue growth. With its rich AI algorithms, the platform will enable the creation of highly personalized and effective advertising strategies, further enhancing Amazon's advertising capabilities.\nCurrently, AWS accounts for 16% of Amazon's net sales. With AWS already well-positioned in AI services through products such as Amazon Bedrock and SageMaker, it is further positioned to see a great leap in revenues due to exponential growth in global AI demand. For instance, if AI-related revenue grows at a much faster rate compared to Amazon's North American and International segments, we could see AWS's share rise closer to 20% or higher in the coming years. \nSource: Amazon\nAWS has a set of advanced AI services that strengthen the AWS cloud computing platform and solidify AWS's market leadership by attracting enterprises with a high demand for sophisticated AI and ML solutions. This is supposed to drive long-term contracts and revenue stability.\nMoreover, its AI technologies can be adapted for various industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, expanding Amazon's market reach and fostering innovation across multiple sectors.\nThe key metrics to track for investors who want an idea of the future impact of AWS's AI innovations on Amazon's bottom line will be revenue growth of AWS' AI and ML services and overall ad revenue growth. This is where the effectiveness of AI-driven advertising strategies can be understood by assessing user engagement and conversion rates.\nExcessive reliance on cloud segment revenue can be considered a decisive weakness for Amazon. However, at the same time, Gen AI is making it a solid uplifter for Amazon. The Amazon Bedrock service provides secure access to leading foundation models, enabling clients to build and deploy AI applications. \nBedrock's broad selection of models and enterprise-grade security boost its appeal to businesses. These include major players like GE HealthCare (NASDAQ:GEHC) and Iberdrola (IBDRY). Further, Amazon SageMaker is used to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. Its features (such as HyperPods) significantly improve performance and efficiency. This service supports various AI applications, including healthcare and energy sectors.\nMoreover, AWS's investment in custom chips like Trainium and Inferentia boosts AI's price performance. The upcoming versions of these chips will derive vital demand. AWS's AI tools, like Amazon Q and Amazon Bedrock, are essential for applications in healthcare, energy, and business process optimization. These tools help accelerate development cycles, improve operational edge, and support advancement across industries. Hence, AWS's AI capabilities derive growth by seizing diverse client needs, from AI model training to application development, reinforcing Amazon stock's presence among Magnificent 7.\nLastly, according to the tech expert Panayot Kalinov, AWS's AI advancements have propelled Amazon's ad sales to exceed $50 billion annually, growing by over $2 billion year-over-year, providing the company with a powerful new revenue stream. As AWS continues enhancing its AI tools and cloud services, this synergy is expected to further boost ad revenue through improved targeting and personalization while enhancing other areas like logistics and customer servicedriving growth across the entire company.\nOverall, AWS's AI and cloud technologies are likely to play a crucial role in further boosting Amazon's ad revenue. Looking forward, one should monitor AWS revenue and margin expansion as a critical signal for Amazon stock's bullish momentum.\nAmazon is trading approximately 33 times forward earnings, higher than Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) 33x and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) 19x. While this suggests Amazon is more expensive, considering the expected earnings growth changes the picture. Amazon's expected EPS forward long-term growth (3-5 year CAGR) is 23.44%, notably higher than Microsoft's and Alphabet's projections. Amazon's ratio becomes more attractive when adjusting for growth using the forward PEG ratio (forward P/E divided by expected EPS growth). A forward PEG of 1x implies fair value relative to growth; Amazon's forward PEG is higher than Alphabet's but lower than Microsoft's, indicating it is reasonably valued given its superior growth prospects.\nAWS takes advantage of the high demand for cloud migration and AI services. AWS's largest strategic advantage over Azure is its in-house chips, which will reduce dependence on suppliers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), thus allowing for improved profit margins. Amazon ramps up leverage in open-source AI models, too, boosting its competitive edge as Microsoft's early access advantage over OpenAI begins to fade. Although Amazon seems expensive at first glance, its strong expected earnings growth, and strategic advantages in cloud computing and AI, support the valuation, making it an attractive choice for growth-oriented investors.\nAmazon's significant reliance on AWS poses a major risk. While AWS contributes 16% of net sales, it generates most of the operating income. A slowdown in AWS growth could severely impact overall profitability. The recent rebound in North American e-commerce may falter if consumer spending declines. Historically, Amazon struggles to maintain net margins above 25%; current margins may regress, affecting earnings.\nAdditionally, rising unemployment rates in 2024 and the recent un-inversion of the yield curvea traditional recession signalintensify these concerns. Deloitte forecasts slower holiday sales growth of 2.3%-3.3% for 2024, down from 4.3% last year, suggesting weakened consumer spending that could hurt Amazon's core retail business.\nBusinesses might reduce cloud and AI investments during economic downturns, potentially slowing AWS growth. Additionally, Amazon's forward price-to-sales ratio now slightly exceeds its five-year average, indicating limited upside and a narrower margin of safety for investors. Given the concentrated dependence on AWS, potential economic headwinds, and valuation concerns, Amazon faces significant downside risks that warrant careful investor consideration.\nAmazon's AWS is experiencing strong growth fueled by high demand for AI services and cloud migration, reinforcing its market leadership and boosting Amazon's overall revenue, including ad sales. While this success enhances Amazon's competitive edge, the company's heavy reliance on AWS poses a risk if growth slows; however, strategic investments in AI technologies and custom chips justify its valuation and position it for continued expansion.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

Gell\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res, the French skincare company, has been testing the offering as it prepares for the Black Friday rush.\nAmazon also announced a new live image capability for its existing image generator feature that allows brands to add flourishes, like steam rising from a coffee cup, to what were previously static pictures.

Amazon made the announcements as part of its Accelerate event last week.\nGell\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res has already been experimenting with the video generator as holiday marketing campaigns get underway. In a press statement, a spokesperson for the French skincare company said that the solution \u201csignificantly reduced the time required to produce a video ad\u201d and has opened the door to video advertising for a wider range of products in its portfolio.\nTo use the video generator, a marketer on the Sponsored Brands platform can submit their product page and go to a drop-down menu, selecting \u201cchoose an AI-generated video.\u201d The tool will then show several video options to choose from that the marketer can edit to their liking. In a demo video, a lavender-scented lotion is fed through the video generator, creating ads that show sprawling fields of the flower. The user then adds additional copy to highlight the product\u2019s qualities.\nAvailability of the video generator and live image capability is limited at first, and Amazon will fine-tune the technology based on advertiser feedback.\nThe e-commerce giant began ramping up its generative AI offerings for advertisers last fall, when it debuted an AI-powered image generator. Appliance maker Whirlpool leaned on the image generator for its holiday marketing last year with a campaign that drove more than 2 million impressions and a click-through rate of 2%, above category benchmarks. Extending the concept into the video realm is part of Amazon\u2019s efforts to attract more upper-funnel advertising spend.\nOther digital platforms, including Meta and Google, have made generative AI a focus, with a pitch around production efficiency and scale.\nAmazon\u2019s ad segment grew revenue 20% year over year in Q2 to $12.77 billion, a figure that missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates and marked a deceleration in growth from prior quarters.\n"

        "Author": "  HALELUYA HADERO ",
        "Text": "Amazon is giving another pay boost to its subcontracted delivery drivers in the U.S. amid growing union pressure.\nDrivers who work with Amazon\u2019s Delivery Service Partners, or DSPs, will earn an average of nearly $22 per hour, a 7% bump from the previous average of $20.50, the company said Thursday.\nThe increase in wages is part of a new $2.1 billion investment the Seattle-based online retailer is making in the delivery program. Amazon doesn\u2019t directly employ drivers but relies on thousands of third-party businesses that deliver millions of customer packages every day.\nThe company also gave a pay bump to U.S. drivers last year. Last week, it also said it would increase wages for front-line workers in the United Kingdom by 9.8% or more.\nAmazon said the DSP program has created 390,000 driving jobs since 2018 and its total investments of $12 billion since then will help with safety programs and provide incentives for participating businesses.\nU.S. labor regulators are putting more scrutiny on Amazon\u2019s business model, which has put a layer of separation between the company and the workers who drive its ubiquitous gray-blue vans.\nThe Teamsters and other labor groups have argued that Amazon exercises great control over the subcontracted workforce, including by determining their routes, setting delivery targets and monitoring their performances. They say the company should be classified as a joint employer under the eyes of the law, which Amazon has resisted.\nHowever, labor regulators are increasingly siding against the company.\nLast week, a National Labor Relations Board prosecutor in Atlanta determined Amazon should be held jointly liable for allegedly making threats and other unlawful statements to DSP drivers seeking to unionize in the city. Meanwhile, NLRB prosecutors in Los Angeles determined last month that Amazon was a joint employer of subcontracted drivers who delivered packages for the company in California.\nIf a settlement is not reached in those cases, the agency could choose to bring a complaint against Amazon, which would be litigated within the NLRB\u2019s administrative law system. Amazon has the option to appeal a judge\u2019s order to the agency\u2019s board and eventually, to a federal court.\n"

        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Ten years ago this November, Amazon released a breakthrough device with an understated tweet.\n\u201cIntroducing Amazon Echo,\u201d it read. \u201cAlways ready, connected, and fast. Just ask.\u201d\nBuried within the subsequent announcement was the introduction of Alexa, too, which quickly captured the minds of consumers young and old on its way to becoming a cultural phenomenon. Coming on the heels of Amazon\u2019s Fire phone flop, the release felt even more astonishing.\nFor a period of time in my household, Alexa felt like magic. Sure, we queried it for weather updates and asked it to serve as a timer during cooking. But it was the ability for our young kids to start a post-meal dance party by uttering just a few words that, looking back, my wife and I remember the most fondly. No, the speaker didn\u2019t have the greatest sound. But it was more than passable and the moments it helped create for our family were delightful.\nThe problem for Amazon, eventually, was that our usage of Alexa never translated into real incremental revenue or profit for the company once the Echo was in our house. We didn\u2019t shop from the company any more than we did before and slowly stopped engaging overall as much as we once did. Over time, Alexa started to sound more desperate, too, offering us suggestions we had no interest in after an answer to our actual query was given. Along the way, Amazon was still spending billions with no real return in sight.\nThen, ChatGPT and the generative AI boom happened, and Alexa was caught flat-footed as my colleague Sharon Goldman reported in depth. Now, a gen AI-powered version of Alexa could be announced as early as this month, but it is expected to come with a monthly fee. Yes, Amazon has half a billion Alexa-powered devices out in the world, but it may be an uphill battle to convert enough existing users to a paid version years after the popularity of the original Alexa peaked.\nIf unsuccessful, it\u2019s fair to wonder how Amazon CEO Andy Jassy would react. He hasn\u2019t been afraid to course-correct and cost-cut aggressively in his three years as chief executive. He could decide that Amazon\u2019s AWS cloud business, with its multiple positions in the AI land grab, is enough.\nThen again, a 500-million device footprint is massive and Amazon has pleasantly surprised the masses and the media before, as the early years of Alexa proved. Can they do it again?\nMore news below.\nJason Del Rey\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

        "Text": "Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) climbed higher on Thursday, adding as much as 3.8%. As of 3:05 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 2.8%.\nThere were a pair of catalysts that sent the cloud computing leader higher. The company got a little love from Wall Street and Amazon Web Services (AWS) got a prestigious new client.\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan initiated Amazon stock with an overweight (buy) rating while assigning a price target of $230. For those keeping score at home, that represents potential upside of 33% compared to Wednesday's closing price. The analyst cited opportunities in both online retail and AWS. Mathivanan believes Amazon has room to expand its retail margins, which will boost profits. He also suggests that AWS growth will continue to accelerate.\nThe analyst notes Amazon's \"dominant competitive position in two large consumer and software end-markets with its retail and cloud businesses provides a lot to be bullish about over the next 12-18 months.\"\nThe second catalyst was the announcement that Central Japan Railway Company had selected AWS to advance its operations. The high-speed railway provides services to 170 million passengers each year. The company will tap AWS' Internet of Things, machine learning, and generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to help make data-driven decisions, improve operational efficiencies, and lower maintenance costs.\nBy acquiring an important new client, Amazon seemed to punctuate the analyst's point about the acceleration of AWS and he's clearly done his research. In the second quarter, AWS increased sales by 19%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-over-year growth.\nFurthermore, Amazon has no equal in the realm of digital retail, generating sales of nearly $122 billion in Q2. Even a small improvement in the company's margins will result in a big increase in profits.\nFinally, at roughly 3 times sales, Amazon is attractively priced, particularly in light of the multiple opportunities for growth.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "New collaboration aims to improve awareness of, and expand access to, online therapy and psychiatry services to the 150+ million people who have Talkspace as a covered benefit\nNEW YORK, September 17, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Talkspace (NASDAQ: TALK), a leading online behavioral health care company, today announced a partnership with Amazon Health Services to increase awareness and discoverability of its mental health care services on Amazon.com. Talkspace is the first virtual behavioral health provider to join Amazon Health Services\u2019 program to help individuals discover and enroll in their health insurance benefits at no extra cost or for a small copay. With more than 5,000 therapists and providers across 50 states, Talkspace improves access to high-quality mental health care services for more than 150 million eligible members. The average copay for a virtual therapy visit is $15, however, out-of-pocket may vary based on the member\u2019s specific deductible.\nMental health challenges are widespread, with millions of people across the U.S. regularly experiencing stress, anxiety, depression, and relational issues. In fact, nearly half of all American adults will face emotional or mental health struggles at some point in their lives. Despite the increasing demand for support, affordability and difficulty finding providers are the top two barriers that prevent individuals from seeking care.\nThrough this uniquely designed partnership, Amazon is helping customers discover, determine their eligibility for, and enroll in their Talkspace mental health benefits if they choose to do so. Many people may not know they have access to these services through their employer or health plan. In fact, studies have shown that nearly a quarter of U.S. adults are unaware of all the benefits available to them through their plans.\n\"This partnership with Amazon marks a pivotal moment in our mission to provide high-quality mental health care to the majority of Americans,\" said Jon Cohen, MD, Chief Executive Officer at Talkspace. \"By making it easier for millions of people across the U.S. to discover their behavioral health benefits while shopping Amazon, we can ensure more people gain access to more than 5,000 licensed therapists they may not have known about, helping them begin their therapy journey with Talkspace.\"\nWhen Amazon customers search Amazon for topics like \"stress relief,\" \"family therapy,\" or \"sleep help,\" they can now discover an easy way to, if they so choose, check their eligibility for therapy and psychiatry services. Customers can also visit the Amazon Health webpage to see if their insurance covers Talkspace and explore Talkspace\u2019s various offerings. Eligible individuals will be guided to Talkspace\u2019s website to complete the enrollment process, get paired with a licensed therapist in their state within days, and can right away schedule live online sessions (audio, video, or live chat) or message asynchronously with their therapist.\n\"Amazon aims to simplify the journey to better health by making it easier for customers to discover and access the products, services, and professionals they need,\" said Aaron Martin, Vice President of Healthcare, Amazon. \"Our collaboration with Talkspace will not only help customers discover their mental health benefits but also, if they choose, gain access to their own dedicated, licensed therapist in a fraction of the time it might take to see someone in-person.\"\nThis partnership aligns with Talkspace\u2019s mission of making high-quality virtual mental healthcare accessible to the majority of Americans through insurance.\nAbout Talkspace\nTalkspace (NASDAQ: TALK) is a leading virtual behavioral healthcare provider committed to helping people lead healthier, happier lives through access to high-quality mental healthcare. At Talkspace, we believe that mental healthcare is core to overall health and should be available to everyone.\nTalkspace pioneered the ability to text with a licensed therapist from anywhere and now offers a comprehensive suite of mental health services, including therapy for individuals, teens, and couples, as well as psychiatric treatment and medication management (18+).

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks for Beginners with Little Money According to Analysts.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other beginner stocks.\nOn one hand, some investors view the status quo as a bear market, and on the other, some analysts hold a bullish view. While caution is necessary, blue chip stocks with historically solid results have an edge in the risk department.\nGeopolitical tensions on the one hand and economic turmoil on the other, have created a concerning situation for investors. On September 3, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared in an interview on CNBC to share his outlook of the market. Lee is particularly concerned about the job market, the surprise inflation has in store for the economy, and weak growth projections.\nLee emphasized that investors must remain cautious for the next eight weeks or so, especially with elections and rate cuts, he predicts that the general public is bound to be nervous and confused. While his timeline may not be exact, he expects economic conditions and political turmoil to settle within the suggested time frame.\nHe further added that it is safer to be cautious than to make hasty decisions at the moment. He also stated that the oil industry is particularly weak due to geopolitical tensions despite a massive rise in production. Lee added that increasing production levels does not indicate a booming global economy, because, previously, production increased only because prices were rising which led to more drilling and activity in the sector.\nLee recommended that investors will be able to buy long, and therefore it is best to remain cautious. He further added that we already had 7% corrections twice this year, and there is a possibility of another 7% to 10% correction in the market. He did agree that the market is currently testing investors' patience and he predicts something close to a 5% pullback.\nOn September 6, Liz Ann Sonders, Charles Schwab's chief investment strategist, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss how investors should navigate the market right now. Sonders held a particularly bullish view of the market. She further added that while there has been significant weakness and churn on the surface, it is concealed by cap-weighted index returns.\nSonders suggested that the market level declines were most likely a set-up for the broadening out we have witnessed. She shared her point of view on the market, which is rather bullish, and emphasized that stocks in the consumer discretionary, technology, and communication services sectors are doing particularly well. Sonders, however, did point out that the market may see an exhaustion in the mega-cap tech trade.\nShe then suggests that investors must let go of the perception that to succeed they must invest in mega-cap tech stocks. She states that there are a myriad of opportunities outside of the mega-cap tech that are high quality. Finally, Sonders believes that a recession is not on the cards and that the current situation is nothing more than a growth scare.\nNow that we have assessed the market, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks for beginners with little money according to analysts. You can also take a look at the best defensive stocks to buy.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 7 best stocks for beginners with little money according to analysts we sifted over multiple similar rankings and ETFs to come up with safe and blue chip stocks. The rationale behind this was that investors with little money don't afford to lose a lot and are more likely to invest in stocks that are safer or risk-free. We then sorted our stocks based on their upside potential. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nAnalyst Upside as of September 10: 26%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Folders: 308\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services, on the other hand, is used by millions of active customers and has over 130,000 AWS partners across 200 countries.\nThe company was first launched in 1994 and is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. As for its cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS) increased its revenue by 17.2%, year-over-year in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2. AWS has logged 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters, making it a star performer.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also making strides on the AI front. Over the past few months, the company has partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models. In July, the e-commerce giant processed a new server design, similar to the ones produced by NVIDIA. As for AI hardware, the company has produced several AI chips including Trainium and Inferentia, allowing it to reduce its dependence on other companies.\nAnalysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 26% upside from current levels. Overall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds and Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\"\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best beginner stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 19 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\nExciting new developments in the artificial intelligence space have continued to pour in over the past few days as the stock market recovers from a major tech selloff. Some of the most trending ones relate to electronics giant Apple, Microsoft-backed AI startup OpenAI, and software firm Adobe. Apple has doubled down on AI with the release of macOS Sequoia, which integrates AI features designed to enhance device performance and user experience. These AI enhancements include real-time content generation and AI-driven privacy tools. With iPhone sales slowing, Apple is banking on AI to reinvigorate interest in its devices, setting itself apart in an increasingly competitive tech market\u200b.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nOn September 13, OpenAI released the highly anticipated Strawberry model, which aims to tackle complex challenges in AI development, including more nuanced decision-making and language processing. This model is expected to advance the capabilities of OpenAI in both consumer-facing tools and enterprise applications. Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos. This positions Adobe at the forefront of generative AI for content creation, with a focus on commercial safety by using licensed datasets.\nLooking ahead, Wall Street analysts project significant revenue and earnings growth for key players in the AI space, particularly in semiconductor companies that power AI applications. NVIDIA, for example, is forecast to achieve an impressive 27% annual revenue growth, outperforming both the semiconductor industry and the broader US market. The total revenue for the chipmaker in 2025 is expected to reach around $123 billion, with earnings projected to grow by over 24%\u200b. The upcoming Blackwell GPU architecture, which offers a 3.7x performance improvement over a predecessor, is seen as a critical driver of AI growth for NVIDIA in the next few months.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. The company recently announced that it would invest \u00a38 billion in the United Kingdom over the next five years as part of a major push to expand data center infrastructure across the country. Other tech giants, like Google and Microsoft, have also previously announced plans to boost data center infrastructure in the UK. The former plans to invest $1 billion in the UK while the latter has confirmed around \u00a32.5 billion to expand AI growth. The cloud departments of these tech giants are leading these investments.\nWells Fargo recently lowered the price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock to $225 from $232 and kept an Overweight rating. In an investor note, the advisory noted that heavy upfront costs related to satellite launches, commencing in the second half of 2024, reduce operating income forecasts for Amazon from 2025 through 2027. The note further detailed that Kuiper presented an attractive opportunity longer term for Amazon, but also unclear synergy with core operations.\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the 19 trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other big tech stocks.\nBig tech has long been an immensely popular area to invest in when it comes to US stocks, and for good reason. Tech stocks, particularly those investing in AI and offering AI products, have been generating immense returns in 2024, with the second week of September bearing witness to their immense potential. This week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their best returns for the entire year, and many tech stocks were part of the faction that made this possible. As a result, there's a huge rise in the popularity of AI and tech stocks. This is in stark contrast to market opinions on AI stocks, particularly during the first week of September, when many were very concerned that we are in an AI hypecycle that is bound to wind down soon.\nAltimeter Capital's CEO, Brad Gerstner, recently joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss trends shaping big tech right now. He noted that the pace of\u00a0 AI at present is faster than any other tech development seen before. He also added that many investors are starting to lean back into big tech ahead of the election. This development may be coming about because of the historical trend that suggests that stocks perform better in the months directly following a US election - in which case, it makes sense for investors to be piling into big tech and AI right now since that's a sure shot way to profit in the next few months.\nA recent notable trend that people have begun to see because of the rise of big tech companies and the growing use of AI is a greater demand for power. Many major tech companies are beginning to require more energy, with the AWS-owner going as far as buying a nuclear-powered data center for $650 million recently.\nThe primary driving force for this rising demand is the need to develop AI. Many energy-conscious investors may see this new trend as a red flag for big tech. However, Jensen Huang has noted that while AI takes a ton of energy to train, once developed and trained, it will also help save energy. He particularly noted that AI is going to become so advanced through this development that it will eventually end up offering solutions that can change the way we use energy, making our operations endlessly more energy efficient.\nWith this in mind, big tech seems to be quite an interesting space to follow right now, especially in the days leading up to the US Presidential Elections. As such, we've compiled a list of the best big tech stocks to buy right now.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nFor our list below, we selected big-tech stocks with the highest numbers of hedge funds holding stakes in them during the second quarter and then ranked them based on this metric in ascending order.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a reputable big tech company operating in the e-commerce space. It is based in Seattle, Washington.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been entering the generative AI space, which has created a lot of hype around the stock over the past two years. This hype also seems to have some substance since more and more customers are now using the company's AI tools and finding value in them. The primary indicator of Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AI-driven growth can be seen in its Amazon Web Services business.\nIn the second quarter, AWS saw sales growth rise to 18.8% year-over-year. This business is also currently the leading cloud platform, with a 31% market share in cloud computing, well ahead of Microsoft's Azure with its 25% share and Google Cloud with its 11% share. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a lot more to look forward to outside of AI since it has been focusing on advertising for quite some time now, and ad revenues saw a 20% rise year-over-year in the second quarter.\nIn total, 308 hedge funds were long Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with a total stake value of $65.8 billion.\nHayden Capital mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cOur portfolio is still recovering from the 2022 downturn, although we\u2019ve made meaningful progress in the last two years. While that experience has taught us many lessons, that dislocation also provided a rich vein of opportunities that we continue to mine today\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best big tech stocks to buy.

        "Text": "Amazon is facing a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of deceptive pricing practices related to its Fire TV products.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Amazon misled shoppers by displaying inflated \u201cList Prices\u201d on Fire TVs, creating the illusion of significant discounts that did not exist.\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, claims that Amazon consistently used false reference prices to make it appear that consumers were getting steep, time-limited bargains on Fire TV models.\nIn reality, the products were allegedly sold at prices much lower than the advertised \u201cList Prices\u201d for months before the sale.\nThe plaintiff, David Ramirez, alleges that Amazon violated Washington\u2019s Consumer Protection Act by using these misleading pricing tactics, prompting consumers to pay more than they otherwise would have.\nThe lawsuit also cites a previous 2021 judgment in California, which barred Amazon from using false or misleading \u201cList Prices\u201d in its advertising.\nThe case focuses on listing a higher \u201cList Price\u201d with a strikethrough and a percentage discount next to the sale price.\nThe lawsuit claims that the List Prices were often inflated or not used for 90 days prior to the advertised sales, making the discounts appear falsely generous.\nRamirez is seeking compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief to stop Amazon from continuing these practices.\nWhen reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson said, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on ongoing litigation.\u201d\nIf successful, the lawsuit could result in compensation for thousands of consumers who purchased Fire TV products under the false assumption that they were receiving significant discounts.\nThe case is scheduled to proceed in June 2025.\n"

It found that Anthropic\u2019s local revenue did not meet threshold limits or have a large enough share of supply in the country.\nAmazon has twice invested in the builder of AI tools, which is able to generate text and analysis. As part of the tie-up, Anthropic agreed to use Amazon Web Services data centers to power some of its operations, and to use Amazon\u2019s custom-built computer chips.\nThe CMA is examining Silicon Valley firms\u2019 investments into the nascent AI industry after it found a growing pattern of transactions and highlighted concerns that the companies may use investments as a way to influence the future of the industry. The watchdog\u2019s separate investigations into Google\u2019s investment into Anthropic and Microsoft\u2019s deal with OpenAI are still running.\nDespite concerns about the investments, the CMA has now open and shut many of its initial probes into the deals. Microsoft Corp.\u2019s investment into Inflection AI was given the green light after the watchdog said the mass hiring of ex-employees from the startup didn\u2019t cause any regulatory concerns.\n\u201cWe welcome the UK\u2019s CMA decision acknowledging its lack of jurisdiction regarding this collaboration,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson said. \u201cBy investing in Anthropic, we\u2019re helping to spur entry and competition in generative AI.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s investment is also being considered by the US Federal Trade Commission, which has sent subpoenas to the company.

        "Text": "This story was originally published on Retail Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Retail Dive newsletter. \nRecommended Reading \nAmazon to roll out 50 heavy-duty electric trucks in California\nAmazon this week announced what it called its \u201cbiggest ever investment in pay and benefits\u201d for 800,000 workers, which amounts to more than $2.2 billion: Full-time front-line fulfillment and transportation employees who work a 40-hour week will get an hourly pay bump of at least $1.50.\nHourly workers will also get a free Prime membership as long as they work for Amazon, according to a company blog post from Udit Madan, vice president of Amazon Worldwide Operations. And an education benefit has been tweaked to allow workers to access language classes when they\u2019re hired rather than waiting 90 days.\nThe increase brings these employees\u2019 average hourly wage to more than $22, below the $24.57 average hourly earnings for retail workers as of August, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. With healthcare benefits and other perks, the average compensation tops $29 per hour, Amazon said.\nAmazon\u2019s hourly pay raise comes amid increased pressure from its workers.\nThe same day Madan\u2019s post was published, hundreds of Amazon warehouse employees in St. Louis\u00a0at a facility known as STL8 held a press conference where they said they were demanding $25 per hour. In that metro area, a living wage for an adult with no children is $21.10 per hour, for an adult with a child is $36.48, and for two adults, both working, with two children, is $26.16 per hour, according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s living wage calculator.\nUnder the new system, the starting hourly wage at STL8 will be $19 per hour, according to Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards.\nIn an emailed statement Friday,\u00a0Ash Judd, an Amazon STL8 worker and STL8 Organizing Committee member, said the workers \u201cmade this $1.50 raise happen through our tireless organizing, and we'll keep fighting until we reach $25.\u201d\n\u201cSTL8 workers like me have fought for higher pay and safer work since our organizing committee went public in 2022,\u201d Judd said. \u201cEarly this summer, we started wearing $25 buttons inside our warehouse and circulated petitions during breaks and shift changes. Amazon will put their own spin on this raise, but we know nothing moves without the workers, when it comes to getting customers their packages on time and when it comes to winning the higher pay we deserve.\u201d\nIn an email Friday, however, Hards said the new policies came out of the company\u2019s annual review of its \u201cwages and benefits to ensure they stay competitive \u2014 and in many cases industry-leading\u201d and were unrelated to the worker action.\nThe e-commerce giant has battled union efforts at several of its warehouses. This year, the Amazon Labor Union, a small independent collective that has successfully unionized an Amazon warehouse on Staten Island, New York,\u00a0voted to join forces with the Teamsters. The labor giant had previously opened a division dedicated to Amazon.\nAmazon\u2019s announcement also comes the same week that Sam\u2019s Club said it would increase its starting wage to $16 and accelerate pay raises for nearly 100,000 front-line workers. That brings the warehouse retailer\u2019s average hourly pay to about $19, an increase of nearly 30% in the past five years.\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to include comment from Amazon.\n"

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Amazon.com, Inc.

The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Amazon.com shares have lost ground lately, along with the rest of its Magnificent 7 peers and other megacap Tech operators, but they have still been strong performers this year (up +13.7% vs. +15.3% for the S&P 500 index. The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive.Amazon.com\u2019s expanding global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses, remain a plus. Growing adoption of AWS is aiding Amazon\u2019s cloud dominance. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Also, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings are tailwinds. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives.However, macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Amazon issued weak third-quarter 2024 revenue guidance due to the changing shopping pattern of consumers, which is a negative.(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)Shares of Roche have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past three months (+22.0% vs. +4.1%). Th company\u2019s performance in the second quarter and the first half of 2024 was impressive because of the high demand for its drugs and tests.The second quarter saw an acceleration in growth as total sales were no longer affected by the decline in COVID-19 sales, resulting in very strong sales growth. Consequently, Roche raised its earnings outlook for the full year. Vabysmo, Ocrevus, Evrysdi and Polivy boost growth. Vabysmo has put up a stellar performance against Eylea.Meanwhile, Roche is also looking to diversify and make inroads in the lucrative obesity market in the wake of declining sales from legacy drugs due to competition from biosimilars.\u00a0 The company\u2019s efforts to develop new drugs are encouraging. The base diagnostics business is also performing well.(You can read the full research report on Roche here >>>)Shares of GE Aerospace have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry over the past six months (+25.1% vs. +7.7%). The company has been witnessing strength in its businesses, driven by robust demand for commercial engines, propulsion and additive technologies.Rising U.S. & international defense budgets, geopolitical tensions, positive airline & airframer dynamics and robust demand for commercial air travel augur well for the company. GE Aerospace remains committed to making investments to boost growth and provide better services to its customers.Its portfolio-reshaping actions are likely to unlock values for its shareholders. Its shareholder-friendly policies are encouraging. For 2024, it expects organic revenues to grow in the high-single-digit range from the year-ago level. However, it has been dealing with high costs and expenses related to projects and restructuring activities.(You can read the full research report on GE here >>>)Canterbury Park\u2019s shares have underperformed the Zacks Gaming industry over the year-to-date period (-0.6% vs. +6.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $100.78 million offers significant long-term revenue potential through diversified projects like an amphitheater, Winners Circle and residential units, driving growth beyond traditional gaming.Financially stable with $24 million in cash and short-term investments, Canterbury Park can fund growth without debt. Improved EBITDA margins and diversified revenue streams, including pari-mutuel wagering and event hosting, support CPHC\u2019s earnings stability. The company\u2019s vision of a regional destination is progressing, with leasing success indicating solid demand.However, risks include a 93.6% drop in second-quarter 2024 net income due to a non-recurring gain in 2023, weak casino revenues and substantial losses from equity investments. Increased competition from nearby casinos could impact market share and profitability.(You can read the full research report on Canterbury Park here >>>)Shares of NVE have gained +0.5% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry\u2019s gain of +16.2%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $367.89 million exhibits strong margins in the fiscal first quarter of 2025, with gross margin rising to 86% and operating margin at 65%, driven by a profitable product mix and direct sales.The company's increased R&D spending by 26%, especially in wafer-level chip scale packaging aimed at medical and industrial applications, expected to drive new revenue streams. Despite a 24% sales decline due to semiconductor downturns, strong cash flows and a $53 million cash reserve support a steady $1.00 per share dividend. NVE Corporation's focus on spintronic technologies positions it well in high-growth sectors.However, revenue risks persist with heavy reliance on key customers and competitive pressures. Rising operating expenses and labor market challenges may pressure near-term profitability, while supply-chain vulnerabilities and inventory management issues could impact operational efficiency.(You can read the full research report on NVE here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include IQVIA Holdings Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence has been the buzzword around Wall Street for many months but a recent selloff in the technology sector has ignited fears of an AI bubble. Investors are looking towards experts to help them make better investment decisions. In a recent commentary on the AI market, as well as the macro conditions surrounding the economy, the investment titan highlighted multiple factors contributing to market volatility, including recession concerns, pre-US election jitters, and profit-taking. Despite these, the investment firm noted, US corporate earnings have been resilient, with the S&P 500 showing 13% growth in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing expectations. The AI sector remained a key theme of this growth, but BlackRock relented that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech companies. In this environment, the investment firm recommended diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOverall, the wealth wizard advocated for broadening investment exposure beyond US tech stocks, particularly into sectors benefiting from ongoing AI buildout, while remaining cautious about Japanese equities and US short-term bonds. In the weekly commentary, the advisory highlighted that the US economy appeared more resilient than anticipated, with broad-based earnings growth suggesting stability. However, inflation remained a concern, and BlackRock expects it to limit how much the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates in the medium term. The investment firm noted that markets were pricing in significant rate cuts, but expectations seemed overblown given persistent inflation pressures, especially from wage growth. The investment titan suggested looking to European markets for income opportunities and remaining underweight on short-dated US Treasuries in favor of medium-term maturities and quality credit.\nThe investment firm also underlined the broader market backdrop in the weekly commentary, noting that US stocks fell due to recession fears, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest weekly drop in 18 months. Treasury yields also declined as investors priced in expected Fed rate cuts. The advisory, however, viewed these recession fears as overstated, pointing to US jobs data that showed slowing but steady employment growth. Analysts at the investment firm maintained that wage gains were unlikely to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target in the near term but cautioned that the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data would be crucial in determining inflation's trajectory. A surge in immigration had contributed to easing wage inflation, according to the financial firm's report, but the long-term labor supply trend would influence the Fed\u2019s ability to adjust rates.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

Claude is an array of large language models developed by Anthropic. The move comes after OpenAI, a rival of Anthropic, launched ChatGPT for Enterprise in August. Both companies offer monthly subscriptions to their AI tools. Amazon has pledged more than $4 billion towards the AI startup over the past few months.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is viewed with bullish sentiment on Wall Street. Cantor Fitzgerald recently initiated coverage of the stock with an Overweight rating and $230 price target, citing retail margin expansion and AWS acceleration. The advisory said it saw a runway in both, but added that the magnitude was likely to moderate compared to trends over the past two years and the path was unlikely to be linear.\nOverall AMZN ranks 5th on our list of the most important AI stocks according to BlackRock. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Lucinda Elliott and Kylie Madry ",
        "Text": "By Lucinda Elliott and Kylie Madry\nBUENOS AIRES/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - When Wagner Dias and his wife Mariana needed a loan to grow their children's clothes business, the Brazilian entrepreneurs turned to Argentina's MercadoLibre Inc, the online platform they use to sell their products.\nMercadoLibre, which is making a push into an increasingly crowded regional fintech and credit market, already had the data it needed to green-light the loan. The Amazon.com of Latin America has used innovations like that to cement its status as the region's most valuable firm with a market capitalization exceeding $100 billion.\n\"Because they had access to all my app history as a seller and buyer, there was no red tape. The money was deposited instantly,\" said Dias, who borrowed in total some $30,000 to build the couple's business in Sao Paulo.\n\"I can ask for credit with one click,\" said Dias, explaining that the first $11,000 tranche of the loan had boosted sales by 40% within six months.\nMercadoLibre, which has overtaken Brazilian state energy giant Petrobras this year as Latin America's most valuable company, is finding new ways to serve Dias and others in its online \"ecosystem\" to lock in shoppers and sellers. Its new offerings, ranging from credit to movies, have helped fuel its rapid expansion.\nThe company is growing digital advertising revenues toward $1 billion this year with tie-ups for content with firms like Disney. It has added distribution centers to support sellers, and is using artificial intelligence to boost its loan business and streamline administrative costs.\n\"We believe that we have a tremendous competitive advantage in the fact that we have an ecosystem,\" the firm's CEO Marcos Galperin told Reuters in an interview in Buenos Aires, adding that the financing and commerce business spurred each other.\n\"When you have more financing, e-commerce grows. And vice versa.\"\nMercadoLibre is the dominant e-commerce player in Latin America, weathering aggressive pushes by Amazon and others. But on fintech it still lags behind pure digital finance rivals such as Brazil's Nubank, though it is ahead of Argentina's Uala. It wants to replicate the crossover success of Chinese online marketplace Alibaba, whose Alipay wallet is among the top players in the world's second largest economy.\nGalperin said growth of the fintech business was strong considering the tough regional competition. Fintech revenues increased nearly a third over the last year, second quarter data showed, though it declined slightly as a percentage of overall sales. Its credit unit grew at a faster rate, near 50%.\nGalperin said MercadoLibre wanted to be a major option for Latin Americans as they rapidly shift away from cash as the traditional form of payment and savings.\n\"Basically the idea is to give each user a private banker of their own,\" he said. He downplayed concerns some analysts have expressed about non-performing loans, saying the plethora of data the firm had on its users reduced that risk.\n\"We use artificial intelligence, we use machine learning, we have a lot of information between MercadoLibre and Mercado Pago that we can use... We have so much information on these people that we feel very comfortable providing them loans.\"\nBUYING NEW SHOES, WHAT ABOUT A LOAN?\nInvestors are bullish on the company's outlook. The stock is currently at $2,100, and in September, Morgan Stanley hiked its target price on the shares to $2,500 from $2,175. Also in September, JPMorgan signed a $250 million financing deal to expand MercadoLibre's fintech business in Mexico.\nGrowing use of smartphones in Latin America is opening up online saving and spending options to millions in a region where around a quarter of the population has little or no access to bank accounts or relies solely on cash.\n\"We're really just scratching the surface of all that we can do,\" said Galperin, explaining that e-commerce and digital payment use was far higher in Asia, Europe and North America. He was targeting tripling active users to 300 million.\nBut MercadoLibre faces strong competition from regional fintech rivals like Nubank or Uala, which secured a banking license last year in Mexico and is also using AI to aid credit scoring systems, a company spokesperson said.\n\"It's still smaller than large competitors, but it has been calling attention in the space,\" said Maria Clara Infantozzi at Itau bank in Sao Paulo.\nArgentine confectionary business owner Silvina Riveros was growing tired of traditional banks but opted to get a loan from Uala to buy appliances \"mainly due to the cheaper commissions for the service and the speed of crediting money into your account,\" she said.\n\"I've given up on high street banks, there's too much paperwork and bureaucracy.\"\nMercadoLibre's potential ace card, however, remains its mix of commerce and finance. The firm is boosting areas like food, apparel, beauty and electronics, and has opened more warehousing and distribution centers to speed up delivery.\nIt is also experimenting with an electric delivery fleet and drones to get goods to hard-to-reach consumers in isolated areas of Brazil. While drone technology remained niche, Galperin said \"those geographies happen quite a bit in Latin America.\"\nMeanwhile, millions of customers like 24-year-old Irlanda Zermeno from Mexico City, are taking out smaller loans from the platform to help them buy more products at check out.\nZermeno told Reuters she was shopping on the MercadoLibre app for a pair of new shoes, when a message popped up offering her credit to make the purchase in installments.\n\"I didn't look for (a credit line), they suddenly just asked me: do you want one?\" said Zermeno, who works in public relations. \"Ever since then I use it frequently. If you pay back on time, the credit amount you can take goes up.\"\n(This story has been corrected to say that MercadoLibre is the more dominant e-commerce player over Argentina's Uala, in paragraph 9)\n(Reporting by Lucinda Elliott in Buenos Aires.

        "Author": "  Sasha Rogelberg ",
        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) new return-to-office ultimatum hasn\u2019t just drawn the ire of employees threatening to jump ship to remote jobs. The mandate has also drawn scrutiny from future-of-work experts who aren\u2019t sold on the benefit of the change to Amazon\u2014and who believe the move could make it harder for the tech giant to attract future employees.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said Monday in a company memo employees would be required to return to the office five days a week, beginning in January. The company will also increase the ratio of managers to individual employees to have fewer staff in managerial roles. In February 2023, Amazon required workers to return to the office three days a week. The goal of the mandates have been to enhance teamwork and strengthen company culture, Amazon said.\n\u201cWhen you consider the breadth of our businesses, their associated growth rates, the innovation required across each of them, and the number of people we\u2019ve hired the last 6-8 years to pursue these endeavors, it\u2019s pretty unusual\u2014and will stretch even the strongest of cultures,\u201d Jassy said in the memo.\nBut Kelly Monahan, managing director of freelance platform Upwork\u2019s Research Institute, doesn\u2019t believe that RTO is a universal balm for company culture and performance. She\u2019s among a horde of experts who aren\u2019t sold on Amazon\u2019s decree.\n\u201cWe are at a critical point right now within our organizations that we have to start innovating how we're working,\u201d she told Fortune. \u201cWe have a lot of data and research that does support that high-performing organizations today are those that are innovating how they work and not going back to models we know that broke five years ago.\u201d\nWhile companies like Nike have cited loss of innovation and collaboration as reasons for bringing employees back to the office, there\u2019s little evidence to support RTO being linked with better company operations, Monahan said. A working paper from the Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh found that when looking at the public RTO data of 137 S&P companies, RTO had no correlation to higher stock returns or profitability, though the paper did not look at the number of days employees were required to go into the office.\nThat\u2019s because a core foundation of employee performance and innovation is trust, Monahan argued, which is associated with greater confidence among company leaders regarding the future success of the business.\n\u201cLeaders who actually enable a level of flexibility through hybrid arrangements feel more confident in their ability to navigate the future and feel much more confident they have the right talent within their organization,\u201d she said.\nStrict RTO mandates, meanwhile, can undermine management\u2019s trust and confidence in their employees, argued Brian Elliott, future of work advisor and author of How the Future Works: Leading Flexible Teams to Do the Best Work of Their Lives. It sends a message to employees that management is looking for control, particularly if the company doesn\u2019t have internal data to prove its RTO policy will increase productivity.\n\u201cWhat Amazon's done by going from three days a week to five days a week for a lot of employees is basically a signal: We don't trust you to be working effectively when you're at home,\u201d Elliott told Fortune.\nRemote work is an emotional issue for employees, who tend to rank their own lifestyles above company-wide success when it comes to picking where to work, Elliott said. Flexible or hybrid work continues to be favored by the majority of white-collar workers. Among Americans who lost their full-time jobs during the pandemic, almost half said they weren\u2019t willing to take another that didn\u2019t have a hybrid option, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 2022 Pandemic Unemployed Survey.\nElliott suggested workers\u2019 strong sentiments toward flexible work could prove to be a headache for Amazon. Not only might the strict RTO policy push employees to leave the company for competitors, it could also make it harder for Amazon to recruit fresh faces.\n\u201cIf 80% of people want some form of flexibility, then you've got a bit of a challenge on your hands, in terms of the talent pool from which you have to recruit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that these shifts cause you to lose people. It is also much harder to attract people into work.\u201d\nA working paper from the University of Chicago\u2019s Harris School of Public Policy found that at large tech companies, RTO policies drove away employees, particularly top talent like senior managers. Strict RTO mandates have also impacted who applies to job openings at companies like Amazon, particularly among women and other marginalized groups. David Hsu, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, found that the remote status of a job was associated with a 15% increase in female applicants and a 33% increase in underrepresented minority applicants.\nFollowing Amazon\u2019s 2023 move to three days a week in the office, the company said it did not see a significant shift in the proportion of women or ethnic and racial minorities employed.\nWith a workforce of over 350,000 corporate employees, Amazon\u2019s RTO mandate is likely to spark conversations in boardrooms about how companies shape their own policies, according to Rob Sadow, CEO of remote work platform Scoop. Amazon, long known for its no-nonsense work culture, will be a beacon for some companies, but once the novelty of the policy wears off, managers will likely take time to reflect on what the culture of their own company requires when it comes to flexible work.\n\u201cAmazon has always had a pretty hard-charging culture, and some companies may decide that's what they want,\u201d Sadow told Fortune. \u201cAnd some companies may decide eventually\u2014relative to their business and culture and the way they engage employees\u2014the right thing. But that discussion will happen.\nSadow was clear, however, that Amazon\u2019s policy shift won\u2019t be a tipping point in the ongoing RTO war that gives the advantage to managers wanting to crack down on remote work. More likely, companies will look to see if Amazon\u2019s performance improves or if a flood of workers leave the company. It could be months before there\u2019s an indication of the policy\u2019s success or failure. It\u2019s a microcosm of the conversation around RTO more broadly, Sadow said. Even four years after the pandemic\u2019s onset, figuring out how to work is a conversation still in its early stages.\n\u201cPeople thought we were like in the eighth inning of this discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're more in, like, the third inning.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Prominent investment bank Goldman Sachs recently released an investor note detailing which sectors of the economy would benefit from the AI craze, replacing obvious bull cases in the technology domain by thoughtful insights on the long-term impact of AI on utilities, industrials, retail, and healthcare. According to analysts at Goldman, AI tools looked set to help companies outside of the technology sector improve productivity and reduce labor costs. The investment titan detailed the insatiable appetite for AI, evidenced by NVIDIA becoming one of the valuable firms in the world over the past year, and noted that the market was yet to reward companies that have downstream AI exposure.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nDavid Kostin, the chief US equity strategist at Goldman, wrote in the investor note that the AI boom was likely to play out in four key phases. The first phase, per the analyst, had been focused on NVIDIA, the chipmaker that is at the forefront of AI data center build. Kostin detailed that the second phase was likely to be about companies building AI infrastructure. Some examples of this include semiconductor, data center, networking, cloud, and security industries, as well as utilities. So far this year, the returns of stocks working in these industries have dwarfed the returns of the benchmark indexes. The third phase, continued the analyst, would be about companies able to put AI in their products and boost sales in the process. Kostin cautioned that these firms had lost ground against AI stocks in recent months.\nThe analyst claimed that firms falling in the fourth phase of the AI boom, ones who would enjoy productivity gains after adopting AI, had been ignored by the majority of the market so far. Kostin maintained that it was unclear when these downstream AI stocks, some of which are discussed in detail below, would rally and expand their earnings multiples, but stressed that this would happen eventually. The industrial sector highlights the Goldman theory in action. Since the start of 2023, industrial stocks have jumped close to 30% in value. Of these, the firms that are directly exposed to AI verticals have more than doubled in value. In the fourth quarter of 2023, over 30% of industrial firms mentioned AI in their earnings reports, up from just 10% in the same period the preceding year.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected non-tech AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Latest reports reveal that Amazon will power the latest updates to Alexa, the virtual assistant it has been marketing for years, with the AI model of Anthropic, a California-based AI startup. The reports indirectly reveal the failure of in-house AI models at Amazon, with some sources that spoke to news agency Reuters claiming that the in-house AI models of Amazon have lag times of six or seven seconds and problems with consistency and accuracy. The ecommerce giant will charge $5 or $10 per month for advanced AI features in Alexa.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is viewed with bullish sentiment on Wall Street. Cantor Fitzgerald recently initiated coverage of the stock with an Overweight rating and $230 price target, citing retail margin expansion and AWS acceleration. The advisory said it saw a runway in both, but added that the magnitude was likely to moderate compared to trends over the past two years and the path was unlikely to be linear.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the 35 non-tech stocks with long-term investment potential. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "Author": "  Brett Schafer, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are up 12% in the last three years, recently surpassing their all-time high, set in 2021. But did you know that the stock has materially underperformed the S&P 500 index over that time span? That's right: The broad market index is up 34% in the last three years, handily beating the returns of the e-commerce and cloud computing company.\nThis is one of the longest stretches of underperformance in Amazon's history. Yet, if we look at the underlying financials, the company is doing phenomenally well. Revenue is growing by double digits, with profit margins inflecting higher. If this continues, where does that put Amazon's stock three years from now?\nLet's analyze further and find out.\nLast quarter, Amazon's revenue grew by 10% year over year to $148 billion. It is one of the largest sales generators in the world due to its dominance in e-commerce in the United States and a few other markets worldwide.\nAnd let's not forget the cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It generates around $100 billion in revenue every year and grew sales by 19% year over year last quarter.\nInvestors should expect continued growth from both of these divisions due to the tailwinds for each one. E-commerce is still just roughly 16% of overall retail sales in the United States. While every transaction is not going online, the trend has been up and to the right for multiple decades now and shows no signs of slowing down. Amazon will benefit as overall retail spending grows in the United States and e-commerce eats up more of this pie.\nFor cloud computing, the situation is similar. It remains a small percentage of overall IT spending, with analysts projecting annual total sector growth of 19.4% from 2024 to 2028. This is another tailwind for the company.\nAdd everything together, and I believe it's possible for Amazon to grow its overall revenue by 10% per year for the next three years, if not longer.\nCombined with revenue growth, Amazon is seeing nice margin expansion as both its e-commerce and cloud computing divisions scale up. Operating margin over the last 12 months has hit 9%, which is an all-time high.\nThree key segments are driving this margin expansion with their high profitability. We already talked about one: AWS. It has operating margins of 30%-plus, and they are growing faster than overall sales. The other two segments are third-party seller services (growing 13% year over year) and advertising (up 20%).\nAll three of these segments come with better profit margins than the traditional e-commerce business. If these three segments keep growing faster than overall sales, Amazon's operating margin will keep expanding in the next three years.\nBesides fast growth at its high-margin segments, Amazon has trimmed its workforce. Various divisions have had layoffs in 2023 and 2024, which should lead to even more profit growth.\nIn Amazon, we have a double driver of earnings growth: sales and operating margin expansion. Over the next three years, I would expect consolidated revenue to grow by at least 10% annually. Profit margins should expand to at least 15% from 9% today.\nOver the last 12 months, revenue was $604 billion. With compound annual revenue growth of 10% for three years, the company will generate $804 billion in sales in 2027. Apply a 15% profit margin to that figure and you have $120 billion in annual operating income. Over the last 12 months, Amazon generated around $50 billion in operating income. So, earnings will more than double in three years.\nWe can't precisely predict what the stock price will do over the next three years. But if the company more than doubles its operating earnings -- which I think is very possible given the above estimates -- shareholders will likely be happy buying and holding Amazon for an extended time period.\nAs this profit inflection occurs, watch its share price climb higher and higher for the rest of this decade.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney\n(Reuters) - Intel's foundry, or contract manufacturing business, has signed up Amazon's cloud services unit as a customer for making custom artificial intelligence chips, the companies said on Monday, a deal that gives the chip maker a vote of confidence.\nIntel's shares rose roughly 8% in extended trading after CEO Pat Gelsinger released a memo to employees announcing Intel had secured the Amazon unit as be a multibillion-dollar customer, paying Santa Clara, California-based Intel for design services and manufacturing. The memo also outlined Intel's planned cost cuts.\nAmazon's AWS cloud computing division already designs several chips for use in its data centers and has hired Intel to package at least one version. Intel will produce an \"artificial intelligence fabric chip\" for AWS and use the chip maker's 18A process, the most advanced version available for outside customers, the companies said.\nIntel said it expects to make additional designs from Amazon on the company's forthcoming 18AP and 14A manufacturing processes.\nThe memo also outlined a number of steps Intel would take to revive itself. Last month, it reported disastrous second quarter earnings.\n\"The board and I agreed that we have a lot of work ahead to drive greater efficiency, improve our profitability and enhance our market competitiveness,\" Gelsinger wrote in the memo.\nAmong steps the board has decided to take, Intel is selling a stake in its programmable chip business Altera. It also said it would pause construction at its chip factory project in Germany for two years, a move Reuters had previously reported. The company plans to pause its project in Poland as well.\nIntel said there are no changes to its plans to expand manufacturing in the U.S.\nIntel plans to keep its manufacturing business, or foundry, inside the company, confirming earlier Reuters reporting. The foundry business is crucial to Gelsinger's turnaround plan for the company, which he outlined in 2021. Until Amazon, Intel has struggled to find marquee customers that it could discuss publicly.\nBut in the memo, Gelsinger said the foundry business would have greater independence, for instance being able to take outside capital. Intel plans to establish it as an independent subsidiary, with an operating board that will oversee the foundry operation. The foundry unit separated its financial performance from the design business earlier this year.\nThe company is also taking several steps to prioritize the core technology behind its central processing units (CPUs), and is reorganizing several divisions, including its automotive and \"edge\" businesses.\nOn Monday Intel also said it was awarded up to $3 billion in direct funding from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, as part of the Secure Enclave program.\nThe company said it plans to send notices in the middle of October to the roughly 15,000 employees it said in August it would lay off.\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have taken a beating over the past few days, merely weeks after a broader market selloff in the technology sector that shook the entire finance industry.\u00a0 Shares of several prominent AI companies like have all witnessed high single digit drops in the space of just 24 hours. The NVIDIA selloff has wiped nearly $300 billion off the market value of the company. The growth-heavy NASDAQ Composite has registered a more than 3% drop in a single day of trading. AI valuations are bloated, no doubt, and the recent bear market has erased nearly $1 trillion in value from AI firms in just a few hours.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThe concerns around top AI chipmaker stem from recent reports that authorities in the US are growing uneasy about the near monopoly of the firm in terms of GPU provision. The stock's outperformance in this regard has delighted investors - the chipmaker is doing business with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta - but it has invited the ire of the Justice Department. The department is speculated to be in the process of sending a subpoena to the company, binding the business to provide certain information, in relation to an antitrust case. The purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli firm specializing in GPU orchestration software, back in April is believed to be one of the bones of contention between the AI chipmaker and the government.\nMacro developments are also weighing on the AI stocks in the near term. Commodity markets around the world are absorbing less than impressive growth numbers from China, impacting prices of copper and rare earths. Copper and rare earth metals are extensively used in AI devices, from chips to batteries. Lates US manufacturing data also paints a not so good picture for factories. According to authorities, US manufacturing witnessed a further decline in new orders and rise in inventory during August, even as manufacturing overall contracted at a modest pace. In addition to these factors, new investment notes on AI from JPMorgan and BlackRock, questioning the ROI on ballooning AI capex, have also grabbed media headlines.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores in North America and internationally. Even as the company increases capital expenditures related to AI, it continues to deliver on a range of financial metrics in earnings, soothing investor concerns around ROI. The firm reported over $100 billion in operating income in the second quarter, with operating margin reaching nearly 10%. The revenue of the firm during this time was almost $150 billion, with nearly 19% growth in Amazon Web Services. AWS contributed almost 70% to the operating income. The business model of the firm, with large stakes in the retail, cloud, and advertising markets, will likely deliver 10% annual top line growth for the next three years.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is viewed with bullish sentiment on Wall Street. JMP Securities recently raised the price target on the stock to $265 from $245 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares, underlining that higher-than-consensus advertising estimates released by the firm seemed reasonable given the vertically integrated full-stack advertising platform, which can serve upper funnel down to lower funnel advertising solutions.\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "(NewsNation) \u2014\u00a0 The people who fill boxes with Amazon purchases, as well as the people who deliver those boxes, are getting raises and some extra perks.\nAmazon said the $1.50 an hour pay hikes will bring the average base pay for warehouse workers and delivery drivers to more than $22 an hour. Amazon is also kicking in free Prime memberships, valued at $139 a year.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to say that this year is our biggest ever investment in our team,\u201d said Udit Madan, vice president of Amazon Worldwide Operations, in a post announcing the changes. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the many ways that we say thank you for all the work that they do to support our customers and communities.\u201d\n Amazon orders workers back to the office 5 days a week \nMadan\u2019s statement announced a few other compensation changes, including more flexible scheduling, more choices in the employee education program known as Career Choice and the elimination of the 90-day requirement before new workers are eligible for those benefits.\nThe pay raise and enhanced benefits come as some Amazon workers try to unionize. Two years ago, warehouse workers in Staten Island, New York, voted to unionize but have yet to win a contract. Earlier this week, Amazon drivers in New York City voted to join the Teamsters Union. In June, New York City warehouse workers overwhelmingly voted for a Teamsters alliance.\nBut in July, warehouse workers at an Amazon facility in Coventry, England, narrowly rejected unionizing.\nOther retailers have recently announced pay increases for some of their workers as well, including Sam\u2019s Club and Aldi.\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

        "Author": "  Maleha Afzal ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list titled Starter Stock Portfolio: 10 Safe Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other safe stocks to invest in.\nA probable rate cut has provided hope for the economy. Despite that, the impact on financial markets and stocks remains uncertain. On September 4, Adam Parker, Trivariate Research founder and CEO, appeared in an\u00a0interview\u00a0on\u00a0CNBC.\u00a0Parker was not surprised that tech stocks were down by close to 4% at the beginning of September, that too right before an impending rate cut. Parker highlights that the inconsistency in the market at the moment is not normal, and with multiple rate cuts over the next two years, he has no reason to hold a positive economic outlook. He suggests that eight probable rate cuts indicate that the economy is slowing, consumer spending is declining, and unemployment is rising, all of which are not good signs for the market. The interviewer counter questions that eight rate cuts with a 25 basis point reduction are not as disastrous to presume a faltering economy. Parker then highlights that rate cuts in the past have been supported by consistent data, an incremental fiscal, and an expansion of the balance sheet, all of which are currently out of the picture. You can also read our piece on the\u00a0best battery stocks to buy according to short sellers.\nOn September 2, CNBC published a detailed report on the impact of rate cuts on the stock market in the United States. The Fed, in the footsteps of countries in Europe and Asia, recently announced an easing cycle, after a long period of high interest rates. As per current pricing data, the Fed is expected to have three 25-basis point cuts by the end of this year. Speaking of the global economic outlook, 2025 will see a lower-rate environment followed by easing inflationary pressures. However, the fear of recession in the United States tells another story. Analysts believe that the last four months of 2024 will be considerably weak and choppy amid geopolitical factors, uncertainty from the AI sector, corporate earnings, and most importantly, an overdue consolidation correction.\nOn September 3, JP Morgan reported that investors must not expect the cutting cycle to provide a fresh start to stocks. Leading strategists at the firm suggested that the rate cut cycle is rather reactive and is in response to a wilting economy, having little to no impact on stocks. Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy, on the other hand, suggested that the market environment today resembles the market in 1995, increasing hopes for a market upside amid stable GDP strength and forecasts.\nBear market or bull market, certain stocks deserve a place in every investor\u2019s portfolio. These are long-term opportunities to hold and will continue to provide superior returns, as they have for decades.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 safe stocks to invest in now, we looked for well-established companies in the energy, finance, healthcare, technology, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industries. These stocks have a history of performing well and boasting consistent financial results, making them ideal and safe long term investments for beginners. We then picked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by money managers and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks first on our list of the 10 safe stocks to invest in now. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries.\nThe company was first launched in 1994 and is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), increased its revenue by 17.2%, year-over-year in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2. AWS has logged 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also spearheading the AI transformation. Over the past few months, the company has partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models. In July, the e-commerce giant processed a new server design, similar to the ones produced by NVIDIA. The company\u2019s investment in hardware is not recent. Its non-AI computing chip, Graviton, has been under development for almost a decade now. More recent chips by the company include Trainium and Inferentia. On Prime Day, Amazon deployed a quarter million Graviton Chips and 80,000 custom AI chips to manage the surging activity on its platforms.\nAnalysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 25% upside from current levels. Overall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion. As of June 30,\u00a0Fisher Asset Management\u00a0was the largest shareholder with a position worth $8.46 billion.\nAMZN is currently trading at 38 times this year\u2019s earnings estimate and the sector forward P/E is 16. While AMZN is trading at a higher multiple, its earnings are expected to grow by 63% this year to $4.73.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0among the safe stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Dade Hayes ",
        "Text": "Amazon is on track to exceed its internal target of $1.8 billion in upfront video advertising commitments, a person familiar with the financials has confirmed to Deadline.\nThe strong buy-in from advertisers follows a move last January by Prime Video to start running ads on all film and TV titles in the U.S. and nine other countries, except for subscribers willing to pay extra to avoid ads. The streaming service hosted its first upfront event in New York during the traditional mid-May corridor alongside traditional broadcast network parents and tech rivals Netflix and YouTube. Along with the promotional push and hefty programming budget, the company has also reportedly been willing to price their ad inventory more attractively in order to stimulate demand as it ramps up its sales efforts.\nMore from Deadline\nSosie Bacon, Amanda Righetti & Janet Montgomery Among 5 Added To Prime Video's 'Scarpetta'\n2024 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming\n'Cross' Trailer: Aldis Hodge Is On The Hunt For A Killer In Amazon's Alex Cross Series; First-Look Photos\nThe Information reported earlier Thursday on the upfront results.\nAn Amazon rep declined to comment on the report when contacted by Deadline.\nIn recent years, Amazon has made video advertising a pillar of its broader corporate strategy, pursuing major sports rights as a key element of its ad-friendly programming. The company is in its third year of exclusive NFL Thursday Night Football streams and will begin an 11-year agreement with the NBA in the 2025-26 season.\nAlong with those offerings on Prime Video, Amazon also operates the FAST service Freevee as well as gamer-centric livestreaming platform Twitch and has highlighted them for advertisers in recent years.\nThe overall streaming sector has shifted toward ads over the past two years after a longtime initial phase when it was viewed as de facto ad-free and subscription-driven medium. Along with new ad tiers coming to Netflix and other outlets, FAST services have become a large and growing part of the landscape, especially for traditional players looking to replace declining linear ad revenue.\nA survey this week from research firm eMarketer said that five streamers would book at least $1 billion in ad revenue during 2024, up from just two in 2020. Amazon ranked third on eMarketer\u2019s list, after Hulu and YouTube, with an estimated $3.13 billion.\nIn his annual letter to shareholders released last April, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy mentioned the ad push and estimated the company\u2019s overall reach at 200 million monthly viewers. \u201cStreaming TV\u00a0advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start,\u201d he wrote.\nNetflix Co-CEO Greg Peters was asked about the competitive streaming ad landscape during an appearance last week at the FT Business of Entertainment Summit. \u201cAmazon came into the market in a pretty strong way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe came with the thesis that advertising is an option\u201d that would appeal to certain consumers at its $6.99-a-month price point.

He said that usually August and September are slow months in the stock market, but during election years the trend shifts to September and October, with markets historically rebounding in November and December once the uncertainty around the election subsides. The analyst recommended investors to position for a post-election rally which he believes buoys growth stocks.\nFor this article, we chose the top 10 AI stocks currently on investors\u2019 radar following important news, earnings and analyst ratings.

Further, Amazon Advertising is garnering significant share in digital advertising, particularly product placement ads, thanks to consumers beginning their product searches on Amazon\u2019s site.

        "Title": "Wall Street Analysts Think Amazon (AMZN) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Amazon (AMZN).\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.06, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 47 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.06 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 47 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 44 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 93.6% and 6.4% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>The ABR suggests buying Amazon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.74.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Amazon.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe latest trends in AI stocks reflect optimism about the future of AI technology, with companies like NVIDIA continuing to dominate the space. The stock price of the chipmaker that is famous for selling AI GPUs has surged significantly in the past two years. After tripling in 2023, NVIDIA shares are up another 140% in 2024, pushing the market valuation of the firm close to $3 trillion. Analysts, like those at Bank of America, have increased their price target on the shares to around $1,500, citing the potential of NVIDIA to drive AI growth for years to come. Bank of America analysts believe the conversion of global data centers to AI-accelerated computing could require up to $500 billion annually, with NVIDIA playing a key role in this transformation\u200b.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nProminent investment firms appreciate the significance of emerging AI trends. According to a report by Financial Times, investment titan Blackrock is exploring the launch of an AI-focused fund, in collaboration with tech powerhouse Microsoft and MGX, an investment firm based in Abu Dhabi. The primary aims of this fund are likely to include focus on creating data centers and funding energy infrastructure to support AI growth. NVIDIA is assisting Blackrock with estimating energy demands for new AI technologies. Analysts have forecast that energy constraints could be a potential roadblock to faster AI adoption. BlackRock will launch the fund with Global Infrastructure Partners, a firm it bought back in January for $12.5 billion.\nThe AI hype is truly global. Tech giant Amazon recently announced that it would invest \u00a38 billion in the United Kingdom over the next five years as part of a major push to expand data center infrastructure across the country. Amazon rivals like Google and Microsoft have also previously announced plans to boost data center infrastructure in the UK. The former plans to invest $1 billion in the UK while the latter has confirmed around \u00a32.5 billion to expand AI growth. Experts have stressed that AI is not just a short-term trend but a long-term transformative force. Francisco Bido, a top portfolio manager, recently underlined that AI was not a fad, noting the significant impact it had on both the top and bottom lines of many companies.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. As the company integrates AI features into the cloud, the software side of the business paints a compelling growth story. The web services section of the firm has an operating margin of more than 34%, far higher than the 5% operating margin of the ecommerce side of the business. The company aims to boost the AWS segment in the coming months with an extensive partner ecosystem and AI capabilities. On the ecommerce side, the firm is focused on growing the international segment.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) might be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a new US government order to increase tariffs on low priced goods entering the country from abroad. In the past few years, Chinese ecommerce giants have had a competitive advantage over Amazon due to the lower taxes and tariffs on low priced goods. Deutsche Bank recently said in an investor note that US President Biden intends to take executive action while waiting for Congress to pass a bill related to the de minimis provision on trade.\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy.

        "Text": "By Jody Godoy\n(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc won partial dismissal of a U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit accusing it of maintaining illegal monopolies, though the details of the ruling by a federal court in Seattle on Monday were not immediately clear.\nThe FTC has accused the online retailer of using anti-competitive tactics to maintain dominance among online superstores and marketplaces. Amazon asked U.S. District Judge John Chun to dismiss the case in December, saying the FTC had raised no evidence of harm to consumers.\nLast year, the FTC alleged Amazon.com, which has 1 billion items in its online superstore, was using an algorithm that pushed up prices U.S. households paid by more than $1 billion. Amazon has said in court papers it stopped using the program in 2019.\nChun issued a sealed ruling, partially granting Amazon's motion. The FTC will be allowed to continue to pursue any claims the judge did not permanently dismiss, court records showed.\nChun also ruled the case will be tried in two parts, rejecting Amazon's bid to have the FTC present evidence of the alleged violations and its proposed remedies in the same trial.\nA spokesperson for the FTC declined to comment on the order. An Amazon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn its complaint last year, the FTC claimed Amazon hampers competition, in part by pushing sellers to use its advertising and fulfillment services. Amazon argued in its motion to dismiss the case that its price-matching and Prime shipping services benefit consumers and are examples of its efforts to compete with thousands of online and brick-and-mortar retailers.The case is one of five blockbuster lawsuits where antitrust regulators at the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice are going after Big Tech.Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Apple are both being sued, and Alphabet's Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge recently found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.\nThe Amazon.com case is an important one for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has long pushed to challenge the power of the huge online retailer. In 2017, Khan wrote an influential academic article arguing the company's structure and practices posed anticompetitive concerns and had escaped antitrust scrutiny.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Tom Hogue and sonali Paul)\n"

Companies are investing billions in AI and they expect to see the results of their investments in the coming months and years.

Smart devices, which include smartphones and tablet PCs, crossed 1bn shipments during the mid2010s. Currently, annual shipments are close to 1.5bn units.

        "Text": "By Jake Spring\nSAO PAULO (Reuters) -Amazon and other companies have agreed to buy carbon offset credits that will support the conservation of its namesake rainforest in the Brazilian state of Para, in a deal valued at around $180 million.\nAmazon and at least five other firms will make the purchase through the LEAF Coalition forest conservation initiative, which it helped to found in 2021 with a group of companies and governments including the United States and United Kingdom.\nThe agreement is LEAF's first deal in the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, which is vital to curbing climate change because of the enormous amount of greenhouse gas its trees absorb.\nThe Para state government and the LEAF Coalition first shared details of the deal exclusively with Reuters. Para Governor Helder Barbalho announced the agreement on Tuesday during New York Climate Week, when about 900 events will be held alongside the UN General Assembly.\nBarbalho said the state would only collect the portion of the sales' proceeds needed to continue its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, while the rest would go to Indigenous peoples, former slave and traditional extractivist communities as well as family farms.\n\"Clearly it sends an important message: A company with a name referencing the Amazon making its first purchase with a state in the Amazon,\" Barbalho told Reuters separately.\nAmazon confirmed the purchase in a statement, emphasizing the importance of tropical forest preservation in addressing climate change.\nWhile demand for carbon credits globally has stalled, tech giants Microsoft, Meta and Google have all made purchases of offsets in Brazil this year.\nAmazon, drug and chemical maker Bayer, consultancies BCG and Capgemini, clothing retailer H&M and Walmart Foundation will collectively buy 5 million credits at $15 per credit. That is far above the average last week of $4.49 for carbon credits linked to nature, according to data provider Allied Offsets.\nEach credit represents a reduction of 1 metric ton of carbon emissions from reducing deforestation in Par\u00e1 state in the years 2023 to 2026.\nAnother 7 million credits will be made available for other companies to purchase. The U.S., U.K. and Norwegian governments have guaranteed a portion of those credits and will buy them if companies do not.\nPara will host the UN COP30 climate summit next year, in a move that is the centerpiece of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's bid to restore Brazil's environmental credentials after years of soaring deforestation.\nPara has been the top state for deforestation since 2005, although destruction has been falling there since 2021. An area larger than New York City has been deforested in Para from January to August this year, a 20% decline from a year ago, according to preliminary federal government data.\nBarbalho said at Climate Week that the government will by 2026 have complete traceability of supply chains for cattle, a key driver of deforestation in Para.\n(Reporting by Jake Spring; Additional reporting by Andre Romani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Nick Zieminski)\n"

        "Text": "By Greg Bensinger\n(Reuters) -Amazon.com will require employees to return to working at company offices five days per week beginning next year, toughening a prior three-day mandate.\nThe change is necessary to \"invent, collaborate and be connected\" wrote CEO Andy Jassy in a letter to employees on Monday posted to its website. He said the experience of a three-day mandate \"strengthened our conviction about the benefits\" of in-office work.\nCompanies have been allowing many employees to work from home since the pandemic, leaving downtown offices nearly empty in a number of cities such as San Francisco and Seattle. However, some tech firms are beginning to mandate employees to return to their offices two or three days per week.\nAmazon has taken a tougher stance than many of its rivals as COVID-19 has become less of a daily threat. Employees have described to Reuters how Amazon has required them to report to, in some cases, distant offices or move to Seattle to keep their jobs.\nAnd some employees who were consistently out of compliance with the existing three-day mandate were told they were \"voluntarily resigning,\" and were locked out of Amazon's systems. A spokesperson for Amazon did not immediately respond to say whether the new mandate will be as stringent, nor did an employee Q&A shared with Reuters on Monday make it clear.\nThe mandate has been deeply unpopular among a vocal group of employees who have said working from home is both effective and spares time and money for commuting. In May last year, workers at Amazon's Seattle headquarters staged a walkout protesting changes to the e-commerce giant's climate policy, layoffs and a return-to-office mandate.\nAs part of an organizational restructuring, Amazon is looking to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of the first quarter of 2025. In the Q&A, Amazon said some \"some organizations may identify roles that are no longer required\" without giving additional details.\nAmazon also is eliminating a prior program that allowed workers the option to work from anywhere for four months per year, according to the Q&A.\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger in San Francisco; Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru and Juby Babu in Mexico City; Editing by Alan Barona and Sandra Maler)\n"

        "Text": "By Greg Bensinger\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com announced on Thursday a new artificial intelligence application that it says will help its independent sellers with sales metrics, inventory maintenance and product advertising, among other things.\nThe move is part of a broader Big Tech effort to employ the technology for greater automation.\nThe software, dubbed Amelia, can provide instantaneous answers to broad questions such as how to prepare for the holidays and how a seller\u2019s business is performing, including units sold and website traffic.\nLater, the company says, the software will be able to help resolve problems of sellers such as delayed shipments without additional human intervention.\nIn a demonstration of the software for Reuters, Amazon showed how Amelia can quickly call up metrics for a seller, such as sales data. It also made suggestions for preparing for major sales holidays, including promotions and buying advertising on Amazon.com.\nAmelia is meant to give sellers \u201ctheir own personalized expert in selling on Amazon,\u201d said Dharmesh Mehta, vice president of worldwide selling partner services at Amazon. \u201cIt needs to be a deep expert in all these kind of core parts of running your selling business.\u201d\nAmazon, which relies on third-parties to supply more than three out of every five units it sells, has had an at-times testy relationship with sellers, particularly over fees.\nBy automating some of the seller customer service, Amazon may be able to more inexpensively handle complaints and other difficulties that would otherwise require human intervention.\nThe Seattle retailer announced Amelia during its annual conference in its hometown where many of its roughly 450,000 U.S. independent sellers converge for tips and tricks, and to learn about new products and services.\nAmelia follows the announcement earlier this year of Rufus, a generative AI search engine Amazon added to its website to help customers find more products. Amazon has since started selling advertising within Rufus, suggesting it may let marketers pay in exchange for the software\u2019s recommendation.\nIt has also rolled out a corporate chatbot and is working to improve its Alexa voice assistant by updating it with a more conversational AI.\nAmazon boosted capital expenditure in this year\u2019s second quarter to about $16.5 billion from $14 billion in the first quarter, driven in large part by AI investments.\nSince the release in late 2022 of ChatGPT, Silicon Valley has seen an investing frenzy over generative AI which can create full sentence responses to prompts or create lifelike images or sounds.\nBut generative AI software can invent answers, known as hallucinations, when it lacks sufficient training data. Mehta said Amelia could hallucinate and such occasions would be addressed depending on the severity of the mistake.\nHe said Amazon had no plans to offer ads within Amelia. The service will not be made available in its current form to large brands such as Unilever, who also sell on Amazon, he said.\nAmazon said Amelia will initially be available only to a small subset of sellers and only in English before nearly all U.S. sellers gain access over the next month.\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n"

        "Author": " Madison Mills    \u00b7 Host and Reporter",
        "Text": "Amazon Web Services (AMZN) isn't putting all its chips on one AI model. Instead, it aims to win by keeping friends close and potential rivals closer.\nWhile other hyperscalers such as Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) compete on large language models, AWS hopes to offer customers whatever models they want. The cloud giant is positioning itself not just as an artificial intelligence platform to train models but as a marketplace to sell them.\n\"There's not going to be one model that's going rule them all,\" AWS CEO Matt Garman told Yahoo Finance at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference. \"The best model today may not be the best model tomorrow. \u2026 If you have a platform that has a bunch of models available, it's actually relatively easy to take advantage of new ones or add new capabilities from other providers as they come along.\"\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy mentioned this strategy on Amazon\u2019s latest earnings call. Jassy noted that Amazon's Bedrock service has the \"broadest selection of LLMs\" and offers a variety of leading foundational models to AWS customers, who can then build their own AI applications using Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3 models, Meta\u2019s Llama 3 models, and Amazon's Titan models.\nThe latest example of this strategy emerged on Monday when AWS and Oracle announced a partnership despite 15 years of competition between the two cloud providers.\nCooperation, not direct competition, is how AWS plans to diversify its revenue streams and monetize AI. AWS is projecting $105 billion in revenue this year \u2014 about 17% of Amazon\u2019s total revenue, according to estimates.\nWhen asked about the perception that Amazon is falling behind on AI \u2014 particularly when compared to Microsoft \u2014 Garman was quick to mention that for Microsoft, \"it\u2019s not their own technology. \u2026 OpenAI was listed as a competitor of theirs, which is an interesting dynamic for them. ... We like to partner, not necessarily compete.\"\nIn other words, AWS\u2019s perceived sluggishness in AI adoption is a strategic feature, not a bug.\n\"We felt that it was more important to actually build a baseline platform that customers could really go build real enterprise value into their applications on as opposed to rushing in and quickly getting out chatbot technology that ... looks cool and allows people to write haikus,\" Garman said. \"That's not really the eventual place that the value is going to come from this technology.\"\nThat focus on AI infrastructure has helped buoy the stock amid a tech pullback. Year to date, Amazon stock has gained 18%, outperforming the Nasdaq index and other hyperscalers, such as Microsoft and Google.\nAnd AWS is not just offering multiple LLMs to customers \u2014 the company is also offering chips from Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Intel (INTC), as well as their own.\n\u201cIf you talk to customers out there, still, the large majority of usage is on Nvidia chips,\" Garman said. \"They have a great platform \u2026 and they're very popular with customers.\u201d\nThat popularity explains why AWS has yet to talk about competing directly with Nvidia on chips. While Garman would not share details about the usage ratio of Nvidia's chips to AWS's on internal workloads, he agreed it would be beneficial to rely more fully on their in-house chips over time to protect margins.\nMorning brief\n\u201cI don't know that we'll ever be fully reliant on [in-house chips] because I think that the Nvidia team builds some great processors and some great products, and they execute really well.\u201d\nIn his remarks at the conference, Garman walked a fine line between promoting AWS chips while reminding the audience that AWS offers Nvidia GPUs as well, again promoting the idea of customer choice as AWS's key differentiator.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to speak at the Goldman conference on Wednesday morning. Garman quipped that he would have plenty to say about Nvidia's partnership with AWS.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, the ROCE of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amazon.com:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.14 = US$54b \u00f7 (US$555b - US$158b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nSo, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 14%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Multiline Retail industry average of 13%.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Amazon.com compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Amazon.com .\nWhile the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has consistently earned 14% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 226% in that time. 14% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Amazon.com has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.\nThe main thing to remember is that Amazon.com has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 108% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\nWhile Amazon.com doesn't shine too bright in this respect, it's still worth seeing if the company is trading at attractive prices.

In addition, it will help Intel sell itself as a supplier of custom AI silicon chips,\" said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.\nIntel is on track to add more than $3 billion to its market value, if gains hold. It fell below $100 billion for the first time in three decades this year.\nThe company missing out on AI-linked demand is partly to blame for the stock lagging far behind competitors like Nvidia and TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer.\nAWS is among the first major customers Intel has announced a definitive deal with. It had said in February Microsoft would use its services to manufacture a custom computing chip.\nWhile a significant step forward, the deal alone is not enough to drag Intel out of its slump, analysts said. Intel would need to manufacture chips for the likes of Nvidia and AMD, both TSMC's customers, in order to fully establish itself, said Hans Mosesmann, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities.\nIntel will also pause fab projects in Poland and Germany for about two years, raising doubts about the nearly 10 billion euros ($11.14 billion) in subsidies from Germany for its two plants in the country.\n\"The move ... should help to boost cash flow, even if the focus on U.S.-based fabs is unlikely to go down well in the EU.

Walmart is integrating intelligent voice assistants and AI-enhanced surveillance technologies to ensure a seamless yet secure shopping experience.\nThese innovations are not just about convenience but also about boosting customer trust. On the other hand, Amazon\u2019s advanced AI applications focus on security at the enterprise level, particularly through AI for coding and surveillance.\nSuch systems enhance both consumer and operational security, ensuring smooth, safe interactions across its vast e-commerce platforms.\nAs Walmart and Amazon continue to drive innovation, their strategies are creating ripple effects throughout the retail industry.\nGlobalData notes that these developments could lead to major changes in areas such as supply chain innovation, customer loyalty programmes, and operational scalability.\n\"Walmart and Amazon's aggressive innovation strategies not only strengthen their market positions but also set a blueprint for the future of the retail sector,\" Kiran Raj concludes.\nThe adoption of AI across retail will only intensify, with both companies setting the stage for a new era of consumer engagement that blends convenience, personalisation, and cutting-edge technology.\nThese innovations are poised to reshape the future of shopping, influencing everything from how consumers interact with products to how retailers manage their operations.\nWhether through Walmart\u2019s integration of AR technologies or Amazon\u2019s focus on autonomous systems, AI is undoubtedly the key to the future of retail\u200b.\n\"How Walmart and Amazon use AI to transform retail\" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Text": "It was a tale of two big etailers on the stock exchange Monday. Sturdy American sector giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) ended the day up more than 2% in price, while Chinese discount goods retailer PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD) slid by nearly 1%. The bellwether S&P 500 index, meanwhile, improved by slightly more than 1%.\nMuch of this stemmed from a new analysis on PDD from Bank of America. The lender concluded that the growth of Temu, PDD's once-white-hot online retail brand in the U.S., is beginning to slow.\nThe bank cited data from Bloomberg indicating that Temu's sales rose by 37% year over year in August. While such a figure would be the envy of many retailers, whether online or brick-and-mortar, it compares unfavorably to the 45% posted in July. It's also down considerably from the 99% of the second quarter of calendar 2023.\nAlthough direct comparisons aren't entirely appropriate, Temu's performance is often matched against Amazon, the commanding leader of the U.S. online retail space. Bank of America estimates that the PDD subsidiary's market share relative to Amazon stayed level in the first seven months of this year at around 3%. It did rise in August, however, inching up to 3.4%.\nCiting data from researcher Sensor Tower, Bank of America added that Temu is suffering from user defection. In August, daily average users (DAUs, a critical metric in the online world) fell by a rather steep 17%.\nTo its credit, PDD management seems well aware of these dynamics. It recently admitted that those once-high revenue growth figures weren't sustainable, and a shift in strategy was likely in order.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Amazon\u2019s recyclable packaging push",
        "Author": "  Oumar Fofana ",
        "Text": "The e-commerce industry has seen rapid growth in recent years, bringing to light concerns about the environmental impact of packaging waste. As one of the largest e-commerce companies globally, Amazon's approach to packaging has significant implications for sustainability.\nIn response to increasing pressure from consumers, environmental groups, and regulatory bodies, Amazon has taken steps to introduce more recyclable packaging options.\nThis article examines Amazon\u2019s recyclable packaging initiatives, their impact on packaging waste, and what these efforts mean for the broader industry.\nAmazon\u2019s \u201cFrustration-Free Packaging\u201d programme, launched in response to concerns over excessive packaging, is an attempt to minimise waste. The programme aims to ship products in easy-to-open, recyclable packaging, often eliminating the need for an additional Amazon-branded box.\nThis initiative, according to Amazon, has led to the removal of significant amounts of packaging material, with reported reductions of over 1.5 million tonnes since 2015.\nThe reduction in packaging waste aligns with a growing trend in the e-commerce sector, where companies face increasing scrutiny over their environmental practices.\nHowever, while Amazon's figures suggest a positive trend, it's essential to consider the broader context. Many environmental experts argue that more systemic changes across the entire e-commerce sector are necessary to address packaging waste issues comprehensively.\nAmazon's shift towards recyclable materials is another aspect of its packaging strategy. The company has introduced paper-based mailers that are curbside recyclable, reducing reliance on plastic packaging.\nThis transition forms part of Amazon\u2019s pledge to reduce its environmental impact and work towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.\nThe adoption of recyclable packaging materials is a step in line with industry-wide efforts to tackle plastic waste, yet challenges remain. Critics point out that while recyclable packaging is an improvement, it is not a complete solution to the packaging waste problem.\nIssues such as recycling infrastructure, consumer habits, and the carbon footprint associated with producing these materials must also be considered to gain a holistic view of the situation.\nAmazon\u2019s \"Less Packaging, More Smiles\" initiative has urged suppliers to adopt more sustainable packaging designs, which may contribute to broader shifts in the supply chain.\nHowever, the long-term effectiveness of this strategy will depend on consistent industry-wide adoption and the development of recycling systems that can manage increased volumes of recyclable waste.\nIn an effort to optimise packaging and reduce waste, Amazon has introduced technology-driven solutions, including machine learning algorithms that select appropriately sized boxes for each order.\nThis approach reduces the use of excess packaging materials and filler, contributing to improved recyclability.\nThe use of technology in packaging is not unique to Amazon, but the scale at which it operates makes this application particularly noteworthy. By reducing the number of delivery trips through optimised packaging, Amazon also addresses concerns related to carbon emissions.\nHowever, whether these technological solutions can be fully integrated into the wider e-commerce industry remains to be seen, as smaller companies may lack the resources to implement similar systems.\nAmazon has also experimented with alternative packaging materials, such as water-activated tape, which is more recyclable than traditional plastic tape.\nSuch initiatives reflect an ongoing exploration of more sustainable packaging options, but questions remain about their scalability and the impact on recycling systems that may not be equipped to handle new types of materials.\nAmazon\u2019s efforts to introduce recyclable packaging have contributed to a wider discussion about sustainability in packaging. As one of the major players in e-commerce, the company's actions have prompted other businesses to evaluate their own packaging practices.\nHowever, the question of whether these changes are enough to create meaningful industry-wide impact is still under debate.\nThe packaging industry, influenced by shifts in consumer expectations and regulatory pressures, is increasingly moving towards sustainable practices. Amazon\u2019s initiatives, while significant, represent just one part of a larger effort to address packaging waste.\nOther e-commerce companies, suppliers, and manufacturers are adopting similar approaches, using recyclable and biodegradable materials and redesigning packaging to reduce waste.\nRegulatory developments, especially in regions like the European Union, where single-use plastics face stricter regulations, have also played a role in driving the push towards recyclable packaging.\nAmazon\u2019s efforts reflect a response to such trends, yet the broader industry still faces challenges in adapting to evolving regulatory requirements and consumer expectations.\n\"Amazon\u2019s recyclable packaging push\" was originally created and published by Packaging Gateway, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Text": "NFL Media Implements Generative AI Tools to Boost Operational Efficiency\nNEW YORK & SEATTLE, September 10, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The National Football League and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced an extension of their long-term partnership. Since 2017, the NFL and AWS have been at the forefront of innovation, leveraging AWS's artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) services to shape the future of football.\nThe global partnership will be on display during this week\u2019s games with the debut of a new AI-powered Next Gen Stat that changes how we understand and analyze tackles in football. The Tackle Probability ML model predicts, at any given moment of a play, the likelihood that a given defender will make a tackle, helping to quantify which defenders are the most reliable tacklers and which ball carriers are most elusive. Tackle Probability can be used to calculate various metrics that can be applied to both offensive and defensive analysis, such as missed tackle attempts by a defender and missed tackles forced by a ball carrier.\nTo view a video of Tackle Probability in action, please go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqvAiuC7d7U.\nPowered by AWS, the Next Gen Stats platform collects over 500 million data points each season. This wealth of data serves as the foundation for innovation throughout the NFL, from enhancing fan engagement through advanced statistics to transforming the viewing experience by enabling alternate broadcasts and new ways of visualizing the action on the field. Additionally, data-driven insights have a direct impact on the game itself by informing rule changes to make the game safer and even more exciting, including the NFL\u2019s new Dynamic Kickoff.\nA key component of the partnership renewal is the implementation of generative AI to increase operational efficiency and drive additional value for the league and its fans.\n\"Through our collaboration with AWS, we are continuously pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in football,\" said Gary Brantley, chief information officer at the NFL. \"By harnessing the power of data and advanced technologies like generative AI, together we are accelerating the pace of innovation in important areas such as player safety, fan engagement and content production. This season we\u2019ll see an increase in operational efficiency as we begin to leverage AWS\u2019s generative AI capabilities at NFL Media.\"\nNFL Media has implemented Amazon Q Business, a generative AI-powered assistant, so users can ask questions and get answers to a wide range of business intelligence and production questions. This enables a self-service helpdesk for common technical and operational questions with detailed and immediate responses. Additionally, NFL Media has launched a generative AI-powered research tool built on Amazon Bedrock that enables the production team to use natural language prompts to retrieve insights and relevant footage from distinct plays throughout the NFL\u2019s Next Gen Stats database quicker than ever before.\nThese developments will boost employee productivity and enable teams to concentrate on producing high-quality content across NFL Media\u2019s properties including NFL Network, NFL Films, NFL.com, NFL+, the NFL app and the NFL Channel on FAST platforms, as well as the NFL\u2019s social media channels.\n\"The NFL and AWS share a passion for innovation and we are excited to continue to drive advancements across the NFL ecosystem,\" said Julie Souza, global head of sports at AWS. \"As we look ahead, this partnership represents an opportunity for the NFL and AWS to reimagine the future of football in a world of quickly evolving technology. By leveraging AWS's cutting-edge capabilities, the NFL will unlock new levels of operational efficiency, further advance player health and safety and deliver unparalleled viewing experiences for fans worldwide.\"\nAdditionally, the partnership extension will build upon several industry-leading innovations, including:\nNext Gen Stats: The NFL\u2019s proprietary player and ball tracking platform, Next Gen Stats, benefits the entire NFL ecosystem as it is utilized by the league, broadcasters, partners, teams, coaches, scouts and players. The NFL leverages AWS to help manage the scale, speed and complexity of the enormous data set. Further, the NFL utilizes AWS\u2019s machine learning capabilities to help turn the tracking data into advanced statistics that help contextualize the action on the field.\nDigital Athlete: This cutting-edge injury recognition and analytics tool provides a complete view of an NFL player\u2019s experience, using video and data from training, practice and in-game action. AWS technology runs millions of simulations of specific in-game and practice scenarios to identify which players are at risk of injury, enabling coaches and training staff to develop individualized injury prevention, training and recovery regimens. The Digital Athlete has also been instrumental in informing recent rule changes, including the NFL\u2019s new, Dynamic Kickoff. The NFL used it to model the new kickoff, simulating 10,000 seasons\u2019 worth of the play to better understand potential risk to players.\nNFL Big Data Bowl: The NFL annually hosts the Big Data Bowl powered by AWS, a crowd-sourced competition that challenges applicants to use data and technology to create new insights and make the game more exciting for fans. To date, more than 50 participants in the competition have been hired by NFL teams or league vendors to work in football analytics.\nUnified View of the Fan: The NFL has developed a platform on AWS that combines data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of fans across all touchpoints. By leveraging AWS\u2019s advanced analytics capabilities, the league can glean deeper insights into fan behavior, preferences and engagement levels, enabling more personalized and tailored experiences.\nNFL Schedule: The NFL uses AWS to power its schedule-making process, running high-performance computing workloads to find the best possible schedule each year from a quadrillion possible combinations.\nNFL Films and NFL Media: The NFL utilizes AWS for NFL Films\u2019 digital archive, ensuring that the league\u2019s invaluable content is preserved and accessible for generations to come. Additionally, AWS provides the cloud infrastructure for NFL+, enabling the NFL to strengthen its direct relationship with fans and provide greater access to football content.\nAbout Amazon Web Services\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud. AWS has been continually expanding its services to support virtually any workload, and it now has more than 240 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, networking, analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, security, hybrid, media, and application development, deployment, and management from 108 Availability Zones within 34 geographic regions, with announced plans for 18 more Availability Zones and six more AWS Regions in Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.

Amazon drivers like me are the face of Amazon. We're the workers delivering your packages to your door. We're the faces and names that you know. It's time Amazon stops treating us as disposable and creates a space where we can discuss grievances in an equitable way. We need a fair and livable wage and affordable medical care.\"\nAcross the country, Amazon drivers are organizing in droves in a fight for better pay, safe working conditions, and a voice on the job, including Amazon Teamsters from Palmdale\u00a0and Skokie, who are currently on strike and extending their picket lines to facilities across\u00a0the country. Earlier this month, in response to growing pressure by Amazon workers organizing with the Teamsters, the company announced raises for Amazon drivers\u00a0and Amazon warehouse workers.\nLast month, Palmdale drivers secured a monumental victory when National Labor Relations Board Region 31 made a determination that Amazon is a joint employer of its DSP drivers, and therefore has a legal duty to recognize and bargain with the Teamsters. This determination sets a major precedent and is expected to extend to Amazon drivers who unionize nationwide. The Queens-based drivers are the first to publicly announce their organizing at a new facility and demand recognition following the historic NLRB decision. As momentum builds, all eyes are turning to the nearly 280,000 Amazon drivers across the country.\n\"Amazon's success in e-commerce depends on the tireless efforts of us delivery drivers, who ensure that packages reach doorsteps swiftly and efficiently. Despite being the backbone of this trillion-dollar operation, we face low wages, grueling schedules, and limited benefits. We deserve better pay, fair working conditions, and a voice in the decisions that affect our livelihoods. As Teamsters, we are building worker power to win the respect, rights, and protections we rightfully deserve,\" said Lamont Hopewell, a DBK4 driver.\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

        "Text": "By Aditya Kalra\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - A lawmaker of India's ruling party and a key retailers' group urged the government on Friday to suspend the operations of Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart in light of antitrust breaches.\nIndian antitrust investigation reports, which are not public, have found Amazon and Flipkart violated local competition laws by giving preference to select sellers and priority to certain listings, hurting competition, Reuters exclusively reported on Thursday.\nPraveen Khandelwal, a lawmaker from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, told Reuters he will soon hold discussions with the federal government and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal to call for action including \"immediately suspending\" the e-commerce companies' operations in India.\n\"The practices of these companies are greatly damaging our manufacturing sector,\" he said.\nGoyal's office, Flipkart and Amazon India did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe two companies have previously denied any wrongdoing and said they comply with Indian laws. They have not commented on the Competition Commision of India (CCI) reports.\nKhandelwal is also secretary general emeritus of India's powerful Confederation of All India Traders, which represents around 80 million shopkeepers and has for years protested against Amazon's and Flipkart's practices which it says hurts smaller retailers.\nThe CCI findings follow a Reuters investigation from 2021 which was based on Amazon internal documents and showed the company gave preferential treatment for years to a small group of sellers on its platform, some of whom were called \"Special Merchants\", and used them to bypass Indian laws.\nTraders and retailers are seen as a key voting bloc for Modi's ruling party, and the investigation findings come ahead of key state elections in the industrial hubs of Maharashtra and Haryana.\nLast month, Commerce Minister Goyal publicly called out Amazon by saying the company's investments often cover its losses and the funds were \"not coming in for any great service.\"\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Susan Fenton)\n"

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other fast money stocks.\nAs the financial world grapples with shifting economic indicators and political uncertainty, insights from leading experts offer a crucial perspective on what lies ahead. With inflation showing signs of easing and the Federal Reserve signaling a likely rate cut, the focus now shifts to earnings performance and broader economic trends. Adding to this complexity are political developments, such as the possibility of a Republican sweep.\nThe latest June 2024 inflation report revealed a softer-than-expected outcome, causing varied reactions across major stock indices. Initially, futures surged in response, but have since fluctuated. Currently, the Dow is showing gains, the S&P is up slightly, and the NASDAQ is just below the flatline. Inflation dropped by a tenth of a percent month-over-month, contrary to economists' forecasts of a rise.\nChris Harvey, Head of Equity Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, and Mike Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JPMorgan, shared their perspectives on the current financial situation in an episode of CNBC's Fast Money. Chris Harvey is cautious about the concept of market rotation due to ongoing uncertainties about earnings. While he doesn't oppose rotation, he pointed out that investor confidence is still shaky.\n\"That\u2019s right. We\u2019re not against rotation; we\u2019re just waiting for more clarity. Many investors are uncertain about earnings. Until we see a situation where companies don\u2019t go down on bad news, we won\u2019t be fully convinced about the rotation. We want people to believe that numbers will improve and that things will get better. However, right now, bad news is bad news, and that suggests the rotation may not be sustainable.\"\nIn contrast, Mike Feroli discussed the anticipated rate cuts. He believes that the Fed is likely to lower rates soon due to its more aggressive stance. Feroli suggests that the economy is weaker than some might think, which supports the expectation of rate cuts. He noted that we have probably reached the peak for interest rates and that future attention will shift to earnings performance.\nFeroli also explained why he updated his forecast to September. This change is based on recent CPI data showing significant inflation drops over the past year and a rise in unemployment. He expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, with additional cuts likely on a quarterly basis.\n\"Yes, the rate cuts are coming. The Fed has signaled their intention to cut rates more aggressively than they have in the past. We also believe the economy isn\u2019t as strong as some might think, so we expect rates to come down. I think we\u2019ve already hit the peak for rates. Right now, it\u2019s really about earnings.\"\nHowever, if the labor market weakens further, the pace of these cuts could accelerate. Regarding the potential impact of a Donald Trump presidency and a possible Republican sweep, Feroli highlighted the uncertainties. A Republican sweep could lead to more tax cuts, possibly extending or expanding those from 2017, which might boost growth but also increase deficits.\nAdditionally, trade and immigration policies remain unpredictable. While deregulation might mitigate some negative effects, the overall policy environment is still uncertain. Finally, when asked about the implications of a Republican sweep for bond markets, Feroli expressed concern about the deficit trajectory. Extending all tax cuts, particularly in a more Republican-leaning scenario, could exacerbate the deficit problem.\nIn another episode of Fast Money, Chris Mman, Chief Investment Officer at Lafayette College, discussed the potential timing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, emphasizing that September appears to be a strong possibility. He notes, however, that the Fed will be influenced by upcoming economic reports. Mman also highlights concerns over equity valuations and the potential impact of delayed rate cuts on the labor market.\n\"I believe July should have been on the table based on today\u2019s report. However, the Fed usually prefers to signal their plans in advance. My expectation was that they probably wouldn't preemptively set up for September, but given today\u2019s report, it seems quite likely they will. The Fed might use upcoming meetings and communications to guide the market's expectations.\"\nAs political uncertainties, including the Democratic ticket's spotlight, add to the mix, Mman reassures that the Fed is likely to focus on economic data rather than political pressures. He stresses that while inflation remains a critical issue, the Fed's priority will be managing employment trends to avoid a deeper economic downturn.\n\"Even if inflation accelerates temporarily, it\u2019s unlikely to concern the Fed greatly. Currently, the focus has shifted more to employment reports rather than inflation. If employment were to unexpectedly strengthen, it could reduce the Fed\u2019s incentive to cut rates. Ultimately, the goal is to avoid a severe economic slowdown that would force them into aggressive rate cuts.\"\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we review recent episodes of CNBC's Fast Money, where Fast Money traders highlighted stocks with high growth potential. We tracked each stock mentioned and ranked them based on frequency. From this, we identified the top 7 stocks that were mentioned a lot by Fast Money traders and were widely held by hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\nAs the world's largest online retailer, Amazon.com Inc.

Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon.com Inc.

While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "After hanging on the ropes for much of August and September, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is suddenly having a banner week.\nThe stock jumped yesterday after the company secured $3 billion in funding from the CHIPS Act, and today it's climbing again after it announced a new partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\nAt 12:23 p.m. ET, the stock was up 4.4% on the news. Investors see it as a sign that the company is reinventing itself after announcing a massive restructuring in its second-quarter earnings report.\nAfter the market closed yesterday, Intel said it was expanding its strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services, announcing a multiyear, multibillion-dollar partnership for Intel to produce custom chips for Amazon, including an artificial intelligence (AI) fabric chip and a Xeon 6 chip designed to handle computing-intensive AI workloads.\nThe news gives Intel's foundry business a much-needed win. It's been losing billions of dollars a year and has fallen behind rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor.\nThe AI fabric chip will use Intel's 18A process, which makes nodes as small as 18 angstroms (1.8 nanometers).\nComing directly on the heels of the CHIPS news, the expanded partnership with Amazon is another significant win for Intel Foundry.\nHowever, investors shouldn't get carried with Intel's rally. The company still needs to execute and do so in a timely, cost-efficient manner, which has been a problem for it in the past.\nIntel certainly isn't going away, and a vast ecosystem depends on and supports its chip design and foundry businesses, but a turnaround will take a lot more than back-to-back favorable announcements.\nKeep your eye on its next earnings report, due out around the end of October. While the numbers will likely be ugly, the company could give some insights into the progress it's making in revamping the business.\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Ashar Jawad ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Right Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks.\nThis year has been a healthy year for the American stock market, fueled by a strong performance from technology stocks. Several indices capped their best week of the year in early September as stocks rose ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting where the central bank was expected to cut interest rates. NASDAQ has led the charge and registered a 20% growth during the first half.\nWhile the index lists over 3,100 companies from various sectors, the rally has been led by its top seven holdings which account for 52% of the index. All of them being tech stocks. There is a mix of optimism and skepticism among investors on whether NASDAQ will be able to continue its good run over the second half of the year. Historical data over the past decade shows that in most instances, NASDAQ has finished stronger during the back half of the year. There have only been two years between 2014 and 2023 during which NASDAQ\u2019s year-end returns were lower than first-half returns.\nHowever, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, told CNBC earlier this month that investors need to be cautious, as stocks could fall 10% during the next eight weeks amid interest rate cuts and the nervousness around the upcoming presidential elections. The co-founder of the research firm also suggested that if the dip is too strong, it should be viewed as a buying opportunity for investors. Lee has largely been on the money and nailed most stock calls this year.\nOther analysts also anticipate market volatility ahead of the presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider noted that stock activity lags between June and August while traders are on vacation. This results in strong market performance aided by thinner trade volumes. The activity jumps up significantly in September when they return to their desks, which often leads to stock price volatility. According to her, a two percent shift in share price in either direction has become the norm in September. However, during election years, the volatility is at its peak in mid-October instead of September, and the market returns to normalcy after the results are announced.\nLPL Financial's Adam Turnquist also expects seasonal shakiness in the months ahead, but pointed out, like Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes.\nBuying the September or October lows has been a very good trade. October, things start to improve, and then you have this November, December, year-end rally, typically very high average returns and high positivity rates for those months.\nBoth Turnquist and Young Thomas agreed that existing portfolios should not be readjusted because of seasonal volatility because it is short-term and hard to forecast.\nWith that said, let\u2019s head over to see some of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy right now, given the current trends and future projections.\nWe scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 to look for stocks listed on NASDAQ and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American technology company that deals in e-commerce, online advertising, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and digital streaming. It is the best NASDAQ stock to invest in right now with sales soaring, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and accelerated growth in the company\u2019s AWS division. Moreover, according to Insider Monkey, 308 hedge funds had investments in the tech giant as of Q2 2024, with the highest stake held by Fisher Asset Management, valued at $8.4 billion.\nDuring Q2, the company's revenue was worth $148 billion, registering an 11% increase year-over-year. Operating income surged 91% from the same period last year to a total of $14.7 billion. Revenue for AWS was recorded at $26.3 billion, up 18.8%. The segment now has an annualized revenue run rate of over $105 billion. Advertising revenue for the quarter also crossed the $2 billion mark, contributing to the more than $50 billion advertising revenue earned by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the last 12 months. Store sales grew 9% in North America and 10% in the international markets, fueled by fast delivery and lower prices.\nThe company has also been spending heavily on capital expenditure and incurred $30.5 billion in capital investments during the first half of 2024. The management expects the figure to be higher during the second half of the year, mainly driven by the need for AWS infrastructure as demand surges for both generative AI and our non-generative AI workloads. Amazon\u2019s leadership is bullish about the long-term impact of artificial intelligence on the business.\nInvestors also remain confident about the company\u2019s trajectory, especially given the strong performance of AWS, where backlog increased 19% year-over-year to reach a staggering $156.6 billion at the end of Q2, indicating strong future demand. The segment\u2019s profitability is also improving and has jumped from the mid-20% range last year to over 30% this year due to strategic decisions made over the past year to eliminate inefficiencies and reduce costs.\nIthaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\nFounded in 1994, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has evolved from its early roots as an online bookstore to become one of the world\u2019s largest eCommerce retailers. At the end of 2023, Amazon stood poised to capture ~40% of all US e-commerce sales, representing five times more share than the next closest competitor. In addition to eCommerce, Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) has become the market leader in outsourced cloud infrastructure. Further, Amazon Advertising is garnering a significant share in digital advertising, particularly product placement ads, thanks to consumers beginning their product searches on Amazon\u2019s site. Amazon\u2019s stock appreciated on the back of stabilization of the company\u2019s cloud computing segment and increased confidence management would be able to contain expenses and push operating margins above prior peaks in the near-to-medium term.\nThe only bearish concern at this point is around the fluctuating operating margins of AWS. However, one reason behind that is the investments Amazon is making to improve efficiency and in building new products. The overall outlook for the company is positive. There is consensus among Street analysts on the stock\u2019s Strong Buy rating with forecasts of a 16% upside in its share price.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has granted clearance for the partnership between Amazon and AI company Anthropic.\nIn a media release, the competition watchdog confirmed that the $4bn deal does not meet the criteria for a merger investigation.\nThe latest development is based on the CMA initiating a merger inquiry into the deal on 8 August 2024.\nIn the merger inquiry, the UK competition regulator investigated if Amazon's deal with Anthropic could result in the creation of a relevant merger situation under the Enterprise Act 2002 merger provisions and, if so, whether the creation of such a scenario would result in a significant reduction in competition within any market or markets in the UK for goods or services.\nThe CMA's decision is part of a broader international examination of big tech investments in leading startups specialising in generative AI technology.\nDespite the scrutiny, the CMA determined that Anthropic\u2019s UK revenue and combined market share with Amazon were insufficiently significant to warrant a detailed investigation.\nUnder the partnership, Anthropic will use Amazon Web Services as its main cloud provider.\nAmazon's bespoke chips will also be leveraged by Anthropic for the development, training, and deployment of its AI models.\nAmazon was quoted by Bloomberg as saying: \u201cWe welcome the UK's Competition and Markets Authority decision acknowledging its lack of jurisdiction regarding this collaboration.\n\u201cBy investing in Anthropic, we're helping to spur entry and competition in generative AI.\u201d\nPrevious decisions by the British regulator have also favoured big tech collaborations, including the approval of Microsoft's partnership with French startup Mistral AI and the employment of key personnel from Inflection AI.\nHowever, the CMA is currently assessing Anthropic\u2019s separate partnership with Google.\nEstablished in 2021 by former OpenAI employees Dario and Daniela Amodei, Anthropic focuses on the enhancement of safety and reliability in AI models.\nMeanwhile, the US Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether such AI deals grant tech giants an unfair edge in the rapidly expanding AI services market.\n\"UK competition regulator approves Amazon\u2019s $4bn deal with Anthropic\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Large Cap Stocks Jim Cramer Can\u2019t Stop Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other large cap stocks Jim Cramer can\u2019t stop talking about.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer highlights a critical gap in the American education system, which often overlooks financial literacy despite its importance. While students may graduate with extensive knowledge in subjects like chemistry, history, and languages, they rarely receive practical education on managing personal finances. Cramer emphasizes that financial planning, retirement readiness, and investing are seldom covered, leaving many people uninformed about crucial money management skills.\n\u201cThere is a gaping hole in the American education system, although I hesitate even to call it a system. When you go to high school, they teach you chemistry, geometry, and physics. You have English classes, history classes, and foreign language classes. You can graduate from college speaking three languages with a deep understanding of quantum physics or ancient philosophy. But you know the one thing they almost never teach you in middle school or high school, let alone college? Financial literacy.\nCramer\u2019s mission is to bridge this gap through the CNBC Investing Club, where he and the Charitable Trust provide practical financial guidance. He stresses the significance of retirement planning, noting that while 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are key tools for saving, many people lack comprehensive understanding of their benefits and limitations.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m on a constant mission to teach you how to manage your money, which is what we do every day in the CNBC Investing Club, with the Charitable Trust providing a constant source of examples. When it comes to managing your money, nothing is more important than retirement. Sooner or later, you\u2019re going to stop working\u2014hopefully sooner rather than later, unless you really love your job. I\u2019m betting most of you, even if you don\u2019t own individual stocks, still have some money in a 401(k) plan.\nCramer points out that while contributing to a 401(k) is widely advised, it\u2019s not always the best strategy for everyone. Despite its tax advantages and the ability to defer taxes on contributions, 401(k) plans can have drawbacks, such as hidden fees that diminish returns.\n\u201cHear me out, darn it\u2014you need to know this stuff. Your future self will thank you for getting your retirement funds in order. While you may think you know everything you need to know about these tax-favored accounts, the truth is there\u2019s a lot the so-called experts don\u2019t tell you or don\u2019t want you to know. For example, conventional wisdom says that you absolutely must invest in your 401(k)\u2014you\u2019d have to be a fool not to contribute.\nHe argues that understanding both the benefits and the shortcomings of these retirement accounts is essential for making informed financial decisions. Cramer encourages individuals to educate themselves about these investment options to ensure their retirement savings are managed effectively.\n\u201cHowever, sometimes I think it can be the wrong approach. I\u2019m not going to sing the praises of the noble 401(k) plan or tell you it\u2019s the key to your financial salvation because 401(k) plans can be a real mixed bag. Sure, they have a couple of really great features, but they also have a lot of bad ones, and those problematic features will eat away at your returns\u2014sometimes through fees that are almost totally hidden from you. I do not like that. So let me lay out the good, the bad, and the ugly of 401(k) plans. Then I\u2019ll tell you whether it makes sense for you to contribute more money to your own 401(k)\u2014maybe there\u2019s a better way for you to invest for retirement.\u201d\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), explaining that he recently purchased more shares of the company because he felt the market was too critical of its last quarterly performance. Cramer believes Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a solid investment and expects it to continue performing well in the future.\n\u201cWe recently bought more Amazon shares because I believe the market was too harsh on their last quarter. Amazon is a buy, and I think it will continue to perform well.\u201d\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s Q2 2024 earnings report reveals a strong recovery, with revenue reaching $134 billion, up 11% from the previous year, and net income soaring to $6.7 billion, up from $6.75 billion from the same quarter last year. This turnaround is largely driven by a 19% increase in revenue from Amazon Web Services (AWS), underscoring Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s dominant position in the cloud and AI markets. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s investment in generative AI and warehouse automation supports its long-term growth prospects, especially in high-margin areas.\nAlthough the retail segment faces some challenges due to cautious consumer spending, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s strategic improvements in its delivery network and shopping experience are expected to enhance margins and increase market share. Analysts remain optimistic about Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s future, with expectations for continued growth in AWS and positive outlooks from major financial institutions like JPMorgan and Wedbush.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the large cap stocks Jim Cramer can\u2019t stop talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Among Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s Top Internet Stock Picks",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of Cantor Fitzgerald's Top Internet Stocks: Best Stocks To Buy According To $13.2 Billion Firm.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Cantor Fitzgerald's other top Internet stocks.\nThe rise of the internet and its ubiquity in our daily lives is perhaps the greatest technological innovation of the 21st century. The transformation of the internet into what can very well be described as a utility was unthinkable even during the peak of the dotcom era; however, the firms that started back then or those that leveraged it to mold their business model are among the largest and most valuable companies in the world right now.\nThe clearest example of this comes through the share price of the world's largest eCommerce retailer. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, this stock ranks 1st on our list of Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. Its market capitalization currently sits at a cool $1.96 trillion, and while it doesn't make it the most valuable company in the world, the firm's unique ability in being able to merge the high volume and total addressable market (TAM) components of the eCommerce and logistics industry with the high growth, high margins offered by cloud computing has introduced a lot of stability into its shares. So much so that its peak to trough share price fall this year wiped off 19% of its value, while Wall Street's favorite AI GPU designer marked a much sharper 27% drop. In absolute terms, this internet stock has delivered 2,077x in returns since its IPO, which is a cool way to turn a dollar into two grand.\nYet, it's still not the only internet stock that's transformed Wall Street and the world. Two other dominant internet stocks are the world's largest social media company founded by Mark Zuckerberg and the world's largest search engine provider set up by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Since they started trading, these two firms' shares are up by 1,275% and 5,608%, respectively while their founders are among the richest individuals in the world.\nThis is the power of the internet. It has spurred new industries, created billionaires, and even has its currencies through cryptocurrencies. Safe to say, the internet is here to stay, whether it's for posting memes or gaining access to healthcare from remote locations. But even though it's been around for nearly three decades now, like the broader industry, the internet continues to evolve and open new frontiers.\nWhile it's lost some steam as the world dealt with the dual crises of the pandemic and high interest rate, the advent of fifth generation (5G) internet technologies is believed to expand the use of the internet across a diverse range of industrial and consumer applications. As per McKinsey, the Internet of Things (IoT) industry could create a value ecosystem that is maximally worth $12.5 trillion by 2030 end. Within this, factory usage of IoT accounts for more than a quarter of the value pie or $3.3 trillion. Application wise, the research firm believes that business to business or B2B applications hold the greatest potential for IoT value creation as they account for 65% of its value creation estimate.\nOf course, the industrial sector is not the only one that's being disrupted by the internet. Another key area where it is making its impact is banking. One of the oldest industries in the world, banks stand neck in neck with governments when it comes to bureaucratic processes, high overhead costs, slow decision making, and slow response times. This has proven to be quite a disadvantage for banks, as according to additional research conducted by McKinsey, internet companies like Google and Tencent are already offering banking related services where they can. Additionally, banks are also being challenged by financial technology firms, with the number of such companies growing from 25 in 2017 to 274 in September 2022 for a combined market value of $1 trillion. This shift to digital banking has also impacted traditional bank valuations, with bank stocks trading at a 70% discount in 2022. The research firm believes that banks that are successfully able to transition to a digitized model can unlock $20 trillion in benefits.\nThese benefits have already manifested. For instance, by adding language processing software to its business, one bank was able to remove 360,000 lawyer hours. As a whole, it is estimated that through digital banking, commercial banks can improve their margins by as much as 25 percent. For the banking industry, these are life or death improvements as during the 15 years that ended in 2022, bank margins had dropped by 25 percent and are on track for another 20 percent decrease over the next decade.\nFinally, due to its ubiquity, internet stocks cannot be classified in one category. They range from social media firms to eCommerce companies, streaming services, and cloud providers. All these firms have their unique valuation drivers, which means that consumer exposure and heavy enterprise spending often prove to be the few broad based catalysts that apply to all firms. On this front, Cantor Fitzgerald, a firm that managed $13.2 billion in assets as of December 2023 has started to focus on some top internet stocks.\nDriving its strategy is the belief that \"despite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names are fairly reasonable and should benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth and as benefits from widespread cost-cutting fade.\" So let's take a look at Cantor's top internet stocks.\nOur Methodology \nTo compile our list of Cantor Fitzgerald's top internet stock picks, we ranked the firm's 22 internet stocks by their share price upside for Cantor's share price target for all the stocks except for stock number 17. This is because the share price target for this stock wasn't available, and as a substitute, the average analyst share price target was used to calculate the upside/downside percentage.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 308\nShare Price Target Upside: 23%\nCantor's Rating: Overweight\nCantor's Share Price Target: $230\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the global leader in eCommerce and a sizeable player in the cloud computing industry. Cantor has rated the stock as Overweight, based on optimism surrounding the two key businesses. For eCommerce, the firm believes that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) can expand its margins in the future via growing revenue, while for cloud computing, it thinks that AWS has further room for growth. Like Alphabet, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is among the handful of companies with its own foundational AI model in the form of Claude. It allows the firm to take an end to end approach to AI, by operating in all layers of the AI stack. This includes Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s in house processors for AI computing, its foundational model Claude, and the final application layer that not only allows it to improve its eCommerce marketing offerings but also enables it to compete in the high end cloud computing market with Microsoft and ChatGPT. Unlike Microsoft though, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s valuation is helped by its stable eCommerce model and removes some of the volatility associated with AI profitability from the shares.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cAmazon.com Inc. (AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 7th\u00a0on our list of Cantor Fitzgerald's top Internet stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Google\u2019s technologies offer advertisers and publishers a safe ecosystem of tools to transact amid the intensely competitive world of online advertising, the company argued in federal court this week to counter Justice Department allegations that it is an illegal monopoly.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai\u2019s Sky-High Rents\nClimate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World\u2019s Megacities\nNew Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century\nVanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion\nNJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC\nIn a federal antitrust trial, enforcers allege that Google has monopolized the technology used to buy and sell website ads, harming publishers and advertisers in the process.\nFor the past week in Alexandria, Virginia, the company laid out its defense, pointing to ways that close ties between its products help it fight spam and fraud, and ways that customers can easily switch to other providers. The trial wrapped up Friday. Judge Leonie Brinkema has scheduled closing arguments for Nov. 25 with an aim toward ruling before the end of the year.\n\u201cI think DOJ has the edge and a finding of liability is more likely than not,\u201d said Justin Teresi, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence who attended the trial.\nAlphabet Inc.\u2019s search giant argues it has no legal obligation to make its ad tech products work with those offered by competitors, and that on the internet, advertisers have many opportunities aside from purchasing website ads. Google competes fiercely against social networks, video streaming sites and other apps for ad dollars, its defense lawyers sought to show.\n\u201cGoogle is never going to tell this court that it is not a big company and that these investments and innovations have not been in its financial interest. They have been,\u201d Karen Dunn, Google\u2019s lead lawyer, said in opening statements. \u201cWe are one big company among many others intensely competing on a millisecond-by-millisecond basis for every single ad impression.\u201d\nCustomer choice\nBoth website publishers and advertisers have many options aside from Google\u2019s ad tech tools, the company said.\nIf a publisher doesn\u2019t want to use Google\u2019s tools \u201cthere are dozens, if not hundreds of pieces of tech they can use,\u201d said Scott Sheffer, Google\u2019s vice president for global partnerships. And there are \u201cmultiple ways to access\u201d ad demand from Google.\nIn lieu of using Google\u2019s ad server, which helps websites manage advertising inventory, they can build one in-house, as companies like Amazon.com Inc., Reddit Inc., Snap Inc. and Walt Disney Co. have done, said Mark Israel, Google\u2019s main economic expert. Small websites can use AdSense, which offers publishers ads from Google based on their content, said Sheffer. The company also offers AdX Direct, a product that connects to third-party ad servers like those offered by Microsoft Corp. or Equativ SAS.\nUnder questioning by the Justice Department, Sheffer acknowledged that AdSense or AdX Direct don\u2019t give the same access as if the publisher used Google\u2019s ad server since it is the only one that gets real-time price information.\nBut even for publishers using Google\u2019s ad server, there were ways to circumvent the tight connection to the company\u2019s ad exchange, said Nitish Korula, engineering director for ad serving and quality. Websites could instruct the ad server to prioritize a different ad exchange over Google\u2019s, he said. They could also boost bids by entering a higher number into the ad server than the actual bid they received to force Google\u2019s exchange to match it, he said.\nAfter questions from the DOJ, Korula acknowledged that few companies use the AdX Direct product. He wrote in 2020 that Google should keep it around because it might help the search giant as a \u201cconcept for antitrust.\u201d He also acknowledged that the \u201cboost\u201d feature had \u201csome downsides\u201d since it would interfere with a website\u2019s record-keeping.\nQuality control over ads\nGoogle, lawyers for the company said, had a legitimate business reason for tightly integrating products across its ad empire: doing so made it easier for its engineers to reduce ad spam and fraud, benefiting the entire advertising ecosystem.\nOpening up its tools to third-party rivals too quickly could make it easier for nefarious actors hoping to game the system and profit from advertising scams, the company argued. On the other hand, having more insight into the ads flowing across its systems allowed Google to catch con artists more quickly.\nPer Bjorke, a company product director for ad traffic quality, testified on Tuesday that Google was one of two primary companies that detected a multimillion-dollar ad fraud scheme called 3ve, leading to the shutdown of the operation and the prosecution of its leaders in 2018.\n\u201cThe vast majority of the 3ve traffic we received and bought came from the third-party ecosystem,\u201d Bjorke said. \u201cI believe that is primarily because we made it very hard for bad actors to infiltrate our AdSense and AdX networks.\u201d\nAlejandro Borgia, Google\u2019s director of product management for ad safety, testified that Google\u2019s end-to-end ad tech stack made it easier for the company to increase users\u2019 trust in ads. \u201cIf users feel unsafe, they won\u2019t click on ads or will turn on ad blockers,\u201d he said.\nIn response, the DOJ sought to show that there were other ways to fight spam and fraud besides tying together its ad products. Google, it argued, was not the only company that engaged in that work \u2014 and there were times the company wasn\u2019t particularly effective.\nMichael Freeman, a DOJ lawyer, asked Bjorke if he had heard of reports that found Google had facilitated the placement of ads on shady websites, including a 2022 ProPublica investigation that covered how Google\u2019s ad business funds disinformation around the world.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember that specific report,\u201d Bjorke said. \u201cI probably read it at the time, but I don\u2019t remember it right now.\u201d\nBorgia, Google\u2019s ad safety leader, acknowledged that in July 2021, the tech company only \u201cactively managed\u201d 10% of its safety policies, including only two related to scams. But Borgia said that didn\u2019t mean the company wasn\u2019t enforcing those policies, only that it didn\u2019t have dedicated models or teams focused on them. \u201cWe provide safety for those policies through other means,\u201d he said, such as machine learning algorithms.\nA wide open digital landscape\nThe government alleges that Google dominates the market for display ads shown on websites. But Google says that is just a slice of the digital advertising world today, where brands can connect with consumers on social media, in apps and on streaming video.\nIsrael, the Google economic expert, said advertisers can and do switch between different advertising formats, and the government should have considered advertising on apps, social media, video, and connected TV, which accounted for $140 billion spent in the US in 2022.\n\u201cFacebook, Amazon, TikTok are becoming the strongest players\u201d in digital advertising, he said, adding that Google views them as \u201cserious competitive threats,\u201d where advertisers are shifting their money as needed.\nBrian Bumpers, the marketing analytics manager for ecommerce site Zulily, said the company often shifts the $58 million it spends a year on advertising among different places. In 2016, Zulily spent $30 million on Google Ads, but dropped that to about $10 million the next year and increased its spending on Facebook\u2019s platforms to $30 million.\n\u2018No legal obligation\u2019 to help rivals\nGoogle argued that US law protects the company\u2019s right to choose whether to make its ad tech products work with others. Forcing Google to provide technology and resources to make its ad tech work seamlessly with rival tools would stifle innovation, the company\u2019s lawyer said.\nThe government is seeking to force Google to share its customers with competitors, said Dunn, Google\u2019s lead lawyer.\nWhen the government says \u201cthat rival exchanges need to have comparable access to Google Ads demand,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019s our customer base.\u201d\nIsrael, the Google economic expert, said making Google provide rivals with the same access to its tools would harm competition and amount to \u201cforced interoperability.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s ad exchange AdX was built before real-time bidding was developed, said Korula, the engineering director. \u201cIt would take years to rebuild\u201d Google\u2019s exchange to allow that functionality, he said.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t prevent other exchanges from submitting real-time bids\u201d into the ad server, Korula said. No company ever offered to undertake the technical work and expense to make their exchanges work with Google\u2019s products, he said.\nThe Justice Department argued that Google has already undertaken much of the technological work that needs to happen to make its products operate seamlessly with rivals.\nIn 2019, it started a project internally code-named Project Yavin to connect its exchange to the in-house ad servers operated by Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn and eBay Inc. It has also already let its ad network, Google Ads, bid on certain types of ads in other exchanges and could expand that feature more broadly.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nApple Rolls Back Its Big Plans to Release Movies in Theaters\nSports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought\nThe End of the Cheap Burger\nInside Activision and Blizzard\u2019s Corporate Warcraft\nThis Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "Text": "Britain's competition regulator on Friday cleared Amazon's investment of up to $4 billion in Anthropic, an American developer of artificial intelligence, following a short probe.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority examined the investment by the US e-commerce giant amid concerns among global antitrust watchdogs regarding tie-ups between AI firms and big tech companies.\nAnthropic is developing a rival to ChatGPT-style AI chatbot.\nThe British regulator had probed whether the partnership caused \"a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services\".\nHowever, it announced Friday that it did not believe that \"a relevant merger situation has been created\".\nThis was owing to the fact that Anthropic's UK turnover did not exceed \u00a370 million ($94 million), nor do both parties \"together account for a 25-percent or more share of supply of any description of goods or services in the UK\".\nAmazon said it welcomed the decision, adding that \"by investing in Anthropic, we\u2019re helping to spur entry and competition in generative AI.\"\nbcp/lth/gv/tw\n"

Additionally, OMG had the highest retention rate as it successfully defended 89% of billings in play.\nCommenting on the results, OMG CEO Florian Adamski said, \"In H1, OMG significantly \u00a0outperformed the industry \u00a0by leveraging \u00a0our Agency as Platform approach \u2014 built for organizational agility and flexibility and powered by Omnicom's industry-leading Omni operating platform \u2014 to deliver customized solutions that integrate the vast collection of specialized talent, capabilities, and processes required to meet the scope and scale of our clients' need in an increasingly complex marketplace.\"\nBeyond topping the global ranking, OMG was also #1 across every region, and in the top three largest advertising markets - US, China, and UK - as well is in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and Turkey.\nPHD and OMD Top the Agency Network RankingsOMG's best-in-class H1 total new business ranking was fueled by powerful performances from its agency networks, with all its agency brands ranked in the top 10 \u2013 and two claiming the top spots on the ranking.\nPHD topped the global and all four regional agency rankings by successfully defending the $2.1b Volkswagen Group business\u00a0- the biggest pitch awarded in H1 \u2013 as well as Sainsbury's\u00a0and HP; while also adding Priceline\u00a0and David Yurman\u00a0to its client roster and expanding its relationship with QSR giant Restaurant Brand's International, for which it supports Burger King, Popeye's, and Tim Horton, to include the Firehouse Subs\u00a0franchise.\n\"In a marketplace where media sits at the center of digital transformation, connected commerce, content and creators, clients are looking for an agency that can deliver integrated, outcomes-centric solutions that can meet this broad spectrum of needs,\" said PHD CEO Guy Marks. \"Our performance in H1 is the result of clients recognizing that PHD - a media agency engineered for connected intelligence and enabled by the breadth and depth of OMG and Omnicom \u2013 will consistently deliver on this mandate to help them outthink, outperform and outgrow the marketplace.\"\nEarning second place on the global ranking with wins that included Gap Inc. and Michelin, OMD was also the #1 agency network in North America for net new business (wins minus losses, excluding retentions).\u00a0 Joining OMD at the top of the North America net new ranking, sister agency Hearts & Science - with H1 wins that included Tapestry, HanesBrands Inc. and Lovesac - placed third.\nWinning on All Fronts in H1In addition to outperforming the market in new business, OMG also lead the industry on multiple fronts during the first six months of the year, starting at CES where the group announced first-to-market partnerships with Google, TikTok, Amazon\u00a0and Meta\u00a0designed to bridge the gap between creators and commerce, driving better ROI across influencer channels.\nDuring the Cannes Festival of Creativity, OMG announced partnerships with Amazon,\u00a0The Trade Desk, TikTok\u00a0and Instacart\u00a0designed to directly connect upper funnel media investments to sales.

        "Author": "  Anusuya Lahiri ",
        "Text": "DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria downgraded the rating on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Neutral from Buy while maintaining a price target of $475.\nLuria noted competition has essentially caught up with Microsoft on the AI front, which reduces the justification for the current premium valuation.\nThe analyst now ranked Microsoft fourth within the Magnificient Six. The stock increased 92% since his January 2023 initiation, compared to 49% for the S&P500.\nLuria noted that Microsoft has accelerated growth and extended margins over the last few quarters as the first to embrace and commercialize generative AI. Through an early investment in OpenAI and the ability to quickly deploy capabilities within Azure and GitHub, it took a significant lead over Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Service and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud, which translated to superior results over the prior 4-6 quarters.\nThe analyst noted that Microsoft\u2019s lead is now diminished in both the cloud and code generation businesses, making it difficult for Microsoft to continue to outperform.\nLuria said AWS is already adding nearly as much cloud business as Azure after a few quarters of Microsoft adding more business. Google Cloud Platform\u2019s expansion has also seen its business accelerate to comparable growth rates as Azure prior quarter.\nThe analyst\u2019s new proprietary hyperscaler semiconductor analysis indicates AWS and GCP are far ahead in deploying their silicon into their data centers, giving them a significant advantage over Azure in the future.\nWhile Microsoft has discussed its Maia chips, it is years behind Amazon and Google and seems to be using them only to run Azure OpenAI Services workloads, he flagged. Luria noted this means Microsoft has been escalating an arms race it may not be able to prevail. He said this makes Microsoft beholden to Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which means it will continue to shift wealth from its shareholders to Nvidia shareholders.\nAfter significant margin expansion last year, Microsoft is now guiding for a decline in operating margins to pay for the data center capex, increasing from 12% to 21% of revenue, Luria emphasized. This is a higher rate of increase than Amazon and Google due to Microsoft\u2019s greater reliance on Nvidia.\nThe analyst said that Microsoft overinvests at these rates yearly, diminishing margins by at least 100 bps cumulatively. To offset the margin drag, Microsoft would need to lay off ~10,000 employees for every year of over-investment.\nWhile Nvidia and others have pointed to a strong ROI for hyperscalers such as Azure, Luria flagged that these returns may only last for a while.\nThe analyst noted Azure\u2019s growth may be boosted by self-funded revenue, such as from OpenAI.\nLuria noted Microsoft has also lost much of the lead for GitHub Copilot. Not only have Amazon and Gitlab mostly caught up to GitHub Copilot\u2019s capabilities, he said Cursor has become the new standard.\nLuria projected fiscal first-quarter 2025 revenue of $64.2 billion and EPS of $2.96.\nPrice Action: MSFT stock is down 0.50% at $433.10 at last check Monday.\nPhoto via Shutterstock\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nFeb 2022\nTigress Financial\nMaintains\nBuy\nJan 2022\nCitigroup\nMaintains\nBuy\nJan 2022\nMorgan Stanley\nMaintains\nOverweight\nView More Analyst Ratings for MSFT\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

        "Title": "Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best Augmented Reality Stock to Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Augmented Reality Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other augmented reality stocks.\nAugmented reality (AR) is a technology that enhances our perception of the real world by overlaying digital elements through devices, adding to your existing environment. There are various ways to describe AR, from spatial computing to holographic projection, but its practical applications define its true value. A notable example of an AR device is the HoloLens, a holographic computer that enables users to interact with digital content within the real world, leading to its growing adoption across various industries such as education, manufacturing, and healthcare.\nDespite its applications and prospective growth, the AR space seems to have lost favor with venture capitalists, with investments declining due to disappointing adoption rates for the gear and leading metaverse platforms. Even the launch of the Vision Pro headset earlier this year, promoted as a \"spatial computing\" device, didn't significantly shift the mood. Reports suggest that demand for the $3,500 device is cooling, prompting the maker to lower its shipment forecast.\nSimilarly, the investment climate in the startup sector remains cold, with only about $464 million invested this year in seed through growth-stage funding for AR, VR, and metaverse-related companies. This sets 2024 on course to reach the lowest funding total in years. Most startups that raised large financings during the peak in 2021 haven't secured new rounds since. However, despite the slowdown, some notable deals have still occurred, with the largest AR-related round this year going to Rokid, a maker of augmented reality glasses, which raised $70 million in January. Another notable investment was in Beijing-based Xreal, a mixed-reality glasses maker that\u00a0 positions itself as a more affordable alternative to the Quest and Vision Pro, which raised $60 million in January at a $1 billion valuation.\nMost notably, Google recently partnered with augmented reality startup Magic Leap in a strategic technology deal, hinting that the tech giant may be preparing to re-enter the AR and VR market, a space it has mostly left to rivals. Over a decade ago, the search engine giant was a trailblazer in AR. This enthusiasm peaked during a 2012 demo where skydivers used the glasses to live stream a jump onto a building in San Francisco. However, the product faced significant consumer pushback due to its awkward design and privacy concerns.\nThe global augmented reality market, valued at $32.1 billion in 2022, is projected to grow from $42.85 billion in 2023 to $432.35 billion by 2031, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.5% over the forecast period, according to industry data from SkyQuest.\nA significant portion of the market is mobile AR, leveraging the widespread ownership of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. As of this year, it's projected that there will be 1.7 billion devices capable of supporting mobile AR. Notably, a key advantage mobile AR enjoys is the massive existing smartphone user base. Unlike the steep challenges AR glasses face, mobile AR benefits from \"zero-cost\" hardware, making its path to adoption relatively smoother. Growth is expected across both enterprise and consumer segments, including digital AR experiences. A well-known example is the 2016 video game Pok\u00e9mon GO, where players explore their surroundings to find virtual characters on their phones. Additionally, collaborations between key market players and 5G providers to address latency issues are expected to fuel market growth.\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we reviewed online rankings and ETFs to determine 20 companies operating in the AR space. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey's database of 912 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Our focus was on companies that produce AR-related hardware, software, or technologies used in developing augmented reality products. However, we also included companies that offer services essential to the AR industry, like semiconductor chips.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers advanced tools for AR and VR developers through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. The company also provides AR/VR platforms such as Room Decorator, which allows users to visualize various furniture pieces in their space, and Virtual Try-On, which lets users see how clothing might look on them.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s AWS business is rapidly becoming a powerhouse in artificial intelligence, with operating margins exceeding 37% in the first quarter, 8 percentage points higher than the fourth quarter of the past year and around 10 percentage points above the annual average margin since 2018.\nIn the first half of 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s operating income soared 141% year-over-year, reaching a record high. The bulk of this profit came from Amazon Web Services, which accounted for 84% of the company\u2019s second-quarter operating profit. Given AWS\u2019s position as a top cloud platform, industry projections indicate annual growth of 15% to 21% through 2028, making Amazon\u2019s performance a key factor in profit forecasts.\nInsider Monkey's research for the March quarter of 2024 showed that 308 out of the 912 hedge funds tracked held stakes in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The largest hedge fund investor was Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management, with a stake valued at $8.46 billion.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best augmented reality stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Mastercard Incorporated MA recently entered into a multi-year commercial partnership with Amazon Payment Services to enhance digital payment acceptance across the Middle East and Africa (MEA). Per the deal, MA will provide its Mastercard Gateway solution, a single touchpoint for payment processing. It is available in 40 markets across the region.\nIt will enable fast, seamless and secure transactions in the said markets. The partnership aims to benefit Amazon Payment Services\u2019 merchants and expand their reach, while also co-developing innovative payment solutions like Secure Card on File, Click to Pay and token authentication services.\nCountries expected to benefit from this deal include South Africa, UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, Lebanon, Oman, Jordan, Kuwait and Qatar. By partnering with Amazon Payment Services, Mastercard can significantly expand its presence across the MEA, covering some key growing markets. The deal will increase the adoption of its payment processing technology.\nThe integration will likely attract a broader base of merchants, including Amazon\u2019s online stores, while also opening up new synergies with other sectors such as telecom and government entities. With the growing demand for digital payment solutions, partnering with a major player like Amazon Payment Services strengthens Mastercard\u2019s reputation as an innovative and reliable payment provider in emerging markets.\nMore merchants using Mastercard\u2019s technology translates to higher transaction volumes, which can drive revenue growth through fees and service offerings. The Mastercard Payment Industry Insights Index revealed that 95% of consumers in the MEA are open to using new payment options like QR codes, wearables, digital wallets, biometrics and contactless payments.\nMoreover, a majority (61%) would avoid shops that don\u2019t accept electronic payments. It also mentions that banks that switched to digital services have seen digital transactions grow significantly, jumping from 70% to 90% in just about two years. This trend shows a strong shift towards digital payments in the region. As such, the new deal can be a game-changer for both consumers and merchants in the MEA region, as well as Mastercard, who\u2019ll benefit from the growth in digitization.\nThis partnership will also enable Amazon Payment Services to scale faster, offer superior technology, and create a more robust and comprehensive payment ecosystem in the region.\nShares of Mastercard have gained 23.5% in the past year compared with the\u00a0industry\u2019s 22.1% growth.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMastercard currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nInvestors can also look at some better-ranked stocks from the broader\u00a0Business Services\u00a0space, like\u00a0Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Did This ESG Stock Receive a Good Rating from Analysts?",
        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other ESG stocks.\nDefining ESG can sometimes be straightforward: it\u2019s a finance and investing approach centered on managing risks related to environmental factors, social issues, and corporate governance. Although the concept emerged about two decades ago through a collaboration between United Nations officials and the finance industry, who argued that addressing ESG risks like climate change, labor disputes, and poor corporate governance can safeguard investments, it wasn\u2019t until the late 2010s and into the 2020s that ESG evolved into a more proactive movement, rather than a reactive one.\nA report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, with the global average near-surface temperature reaching 1.45\u00b0C\u2014closer than ever to the 1.5\u00b0C lower limit set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. Another report from the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also reveals that climate-driven disasters are already surpassing scientists\u2019 initial predictions. This urgency has sparked increased interest in niche yet rapidly expanding sectors of ESG investing, such as climate-transition funds and catastrophe bonds. In 2024, global investment in clean energy is expected to hit a significant milestone, doubling the amount allocated to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) 2024 World Energy Investment report forecasts that total global energy investment will surpass $3 trillion this year, with $2 trillion directed toward clean technologies like renewables, electric vehicles, and nuclear power. Furthermore, Bloomberg reports that global investment in the energy transition surged by 17% last year, reaching a record $1.8 trillion, with this growth trend continuing. Former VettaFi financial futurist Dave Nadig said:\n\u201cIf you solely look at climate as your window, you\u2019ll probably not end up not owning a lot of energy companies, not owning a lot of miners [and] not owning a lot of steel companies. So, you end up with something that looks like services, healthcare, and technology, which is a very strong bet to take.\u201d\nThat said, U.S. funds with ESG goals seem to be losing popularity as of late. Despite the broader stock market\u2019s gains, assets in the sector have dropped to around $335 billion, down from a peak near $365 billion at the end of 2021. Political criticism of ESG in the country has also has led some investors to reconsider their strategies within the sector. Moreover, ESG stocks are also grappling with other significant challenges, such as a key climate regulation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that is currently under legal dispute, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s resistance to including environmental risks in global financial regulations.\nHowever, despite criticism labeling the ESG sector as \u201cwoke\u201d investing, many U.S. firms remain dedicated to ESG initiatives. Investor interest also remains somewhat robust, as these funds continue to attract attention for considering both financial performance and environmental, social, and governance factors. While there have been big outflows from the sector, many institutional investors are approaching climate risks and opportunities in their portfolios with a heightened sense of urgency, with an August analysis published in the Harvard Business Review showing that nearly three-quarters of the corporate climate commitments announced in 2021 had been fully or partially achieved. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are among the top global underwriters of green bonds this year, while Bank of America, alongside other prominent investment banking firms, recently sponsored ESG-focused conferences in New York and Chicago.\nWith that in mind, ESG funds saw strong performance in the first half of the year, largely driven by their substantial investments in technology stocks. Most ESG funds that aren\u2019t focused on renewable energy tend to allocate more to tech stocks while maintaining a lower exposure to oil and gas stocks. In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 rose by approximately 15%, and nearly 60% of this gain was driven by the majority of the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019, which are often among the largest holdings in ESG funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo create the list of top ESG stocks to buy now, we chose companies from the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF and ranked them by their percentage weight in the fund, listed in ascending order. In addition, we used hedge fund sentiments regarding each stock to illustrate how well these stocks hold up in the eyes of hedge fund investors. These were taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 2024 database.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nPercentage of holdings in the fund: 3.55%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) initially aimed to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2030 and power its operations with 100% renewable energy, a goal it claims to have achieved seven years ahead of schedule. In July 2020, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched The Climate Pledge Fund to accelerate the development of sustainable technologies and services in line with The Climate Pledge. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is backing nearly 1.7 GW of capacity across six offshore wind farms in Europe, which, when fully operational, are expected to generate enough energy to power 1.8 million average European homes. These initiatives make Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) the world\u2019s leading corporate buyer of offshore wind energy.\nIn the first half of 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) saw its operating income surge 141% year-over-year, reaching a record high. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the primary driver of this profit, contributing 84% of the company\u2019s second-quarter operating income. As a leading cloud platform, AWS is projected to grow annually by 15% to 21% through 2028, making Amazon\u2019s performance a crucial factor in future profit forecasts.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also a dominant force in digital advertising, surpassing a $50 billion annual run rate with 20% growth. The company generated $53 billion in free cash flow over the past year and remains appealing at its current share price, bolstered by strong cash flow yields.\nMorgan Stanley recently reiterated its positive outlook on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), maintaining an Overweight rating and a $210 price target. The firm remains optimistic about AMZN\u2019s financial prospects, noting that the stock is currently trading at 21 times Morgan Stanley\u2019s projected 2026 free cash flow. This valuation suggests a 30% growth rate in free cash flow per share CAGR from 2024 to 2026, representing a roughly 30% discount compared to the median growth-adjusted multiple of Amazon\u2019s mega-cap tech peers.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 4th on our list of the best ESG stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this month.\nAI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies \u2014 especially generative AI \u2014 has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nFinancial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs.\nThe retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases.

Anthropic, the generative artificial intelligence company that is backed by Amazon, recently announced that it would be launching a version of Claude geared towards large businesses. Claude is an array of large language models developed by Anthropic. The move comes after OpenAI, a rival of Anthropic, launched ChatGPT for Enterprise in August. Both companies offer monthly subscriptions to their AI tools. TechCrunch reports that the subscription for Claude would cost more than $30 per month. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has already pledged more than $4 billion towards the AI startup. Anthropic is on track to generate more than $1 billion in revenue this year and has plans to raise funding at a valuation of over $40 billion.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this month.

Amazon launched the portal in January, starting with a collaboration with chronic condition management company Omada Health.\nWhen Amazon users search for topics like \u201cstress relief\u201d or \u201cfamily therapy,\u201d they can check if their insurer or employer covers Talkspace services, according to a press release.\nIf they\u2019re eligible, users will be directed to Talkspace\u2019s website to enroll and be paired with a therapist. Consumers can also check their coverage through Amazon\u2019s health conditions webpage. Amazon and Talkspace say the partnership aims to boost the use of benefits provided through health plans or employers, as many workers aren\u2019t aware of the options already available to them.\nThe average copay for a virtual visit is $15, though out-of-pocket costs could vary based on the user\u2019s deductible, according to Talkspace, which offers access to more than 5,000 therapists and other providers across 50 states.\nThe partnership could be a boon for Talkspace, an online therapy company that went public in 2021 amid a larger boom among digital health firms. It operates in a crowded digital mental health marketplace and draws most of its revenue from payers and employers. Spokespeople for Amazon and Talkspace declined to share financial details behind the partnership.\nThe addition of Talkspace to Amazon\u2019s health conditions programs comes about nine months after the initiative first launched. Its first partner, Omada, offers cardiometabolic health programs when users search Amazon for related devices, like blood pressure cuffs or glucose monitors.\nThe tech giant also plans to expand the program and benefits by partnering with more digital health companies in the future, an Amazon spokesperson told Healthcare Dive.\nThe conditions program is one several healthcare offerings launched by Amazon \u2014 not all of which have been successful.\nThis summer, the company folded its telehealth marketplace, previously called Amazon Clinic, into its primary care chain One Medical, and cut prices for messaging and video visits. Amazon acquired One Medical for $3.9 billion last year.\n"

        "Author": "  Shilpa Mete ",
        "Text": "Buoyed by cloud dominance, Amazon AMZN shares have gained 14.1% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the industry\u2019s return of 11.2%. The company is also outperforming two other major cloud behemoths \u2014 Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google, which have returned 8.7% and 12%, respectively, in the same time frame.In second-quarter 2024, AMZN\u2019s cloud-computing arm \u2014 Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) \u2014 generated revenues of $26.3 billion (18% of net sales), which rose 19% year over year.Per Canalys data, AWS accounted for 33% of the total cloud spending in the same quarter, while Microsoft and Google accounted for 20% and 10%, respectively.Amazon has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, making significant strides in strengthening its Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities. This, in turn, is strengthening its cloud-computing solutions.However, the AMZN stock has underperformed the S&P 500 index\u2019s rally of 15.9% year to date. Although Amazon is considered the e-commerce giant due to its solid Prime momentum Prime, growing relationships with third-party sellers and strong online store offerings, foreign exchange headwinds and changing consumer spending patterns are concerning for the company\u2019s online retail business.Given these hurdles in the e-commerce space, the most crucial question is whether Amazon's cloud momentum will drive the stock.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAWS\u2019s concerted efforts toward strengthening service offerings remain crucial in sustaining its dominance in the booming cloud market.It recently unveiled a GenAI-powered service called AWS App Studio, which helps create enterprise-grade applications by leveraging natural language. It simplifies and fastens the process of developing an application from scratch.The company announced the general availability of its new managed service called AWS Parallel Computing Service, which enables customers to build scientific and engineering models and seamlessly manage high-performance computing infrastructure.Its introduction of AWS Graviton4-based compute instances, which offer up to 30% better price performance than the industry-leading AWS Graviton3 instances, remains noteworthy.AWS\u2019s deepening focus on innovating Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the GenAI space, is a major positive. The unveiling of Bedrock features like custom model import capability and model evaluation capabilities, and Guardrails, which are designed to provide customers a secure, easy and fast way to develop advanced GenAI applications, is a plus.The company\u2019s GenAI offerings include a smart assistant called Amazon Q, which generates codes, tests and debugs, and has multi-step planning and reasoning capabilities.Apart from robust cloud solutions, Amazon\u2019s expanding network of infrastructure regions is another positive. It recently launched AWS Asia Pacific (Malaysia) Region. With this move, AWS now has 108 Availability Zones across 34 geographic regions, with announced plans to launch 18 more Availability Zones and six more AWS Regions in Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.\nStrong GenAI capabilities, coupled with AWS\u2019s other robust cloud solutions, expanding data center network, and an increasing number of infrastructure regions and Availability Zones, are bolstering its customer base.Recently, AWS was selected by the Central Japan Railway Company. The latter is using AWS's Internet of Things, machine learning (ML) and GenAI capabilities to drive efficient operations for its next-generation, high-speed train service.A global gold producer named Gold Fields shifted its end-to-end SAP and treasury systems to AWS. Gold Fields is also leveraging AWS\u2019s analytics, ML and GenAI solutions to modernize technology infrastructure.Accenture ACN joined forces with AWS to develop the Accenture Responsible Artificial Intelligence platform. Accenture leverages AWS\u2019s AI services, including Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker, along with AWS Control Tower, Amazon DataZone and AWS observability tools.Infor, a leading provider of a global leader in business cloud software, recently selected Amazon Bedrock to deploy GenAI solutions embedded within Infor CloudSuite.AWS was picked by Iberdrola and PolyAI as their preferred cloud provider.Robin AI teamed up with AWS to power its legal assistant by using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker.GE HealthCare GEHC selected AWS as its strategic cloud provider to accelerate healthcare transformation with GenAI. GEHC intends to utilize AWS\u2019s ML and GenAI capabilities for this purpose.The collaboration of Exscientia with AWS remains noteworthy. The former is expanding the use of AWS\u2019s AI and ML services to accelerate early drug development at a lower cost.\nAWS\u2019s expanding customer base on the back of solid portfolio strength is expected to aid its long-term prospects.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $634.49 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 10.4%.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings stands at $4.74 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 63.5%. The estimate has moved north by a penny over the past 30 days.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlthough Amazon's cloud prospects and AI initiatives are positives, broader market concerns, macroeconomic uncertainties, geo-political tensions and intensifying cloud competition are major concerns, which make its near-term prospects foggy.The looming regulatory scrutiny adds an element of uncertainty to the AMZN stock\u2019s AI-driven growth prospects.Additionally, the hurdles Amazon is facing in its e-commerce business do not bode well.AMZN is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 2.67X compared with the industry\u2019s 1.73X, reflecting a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon\u2019s solid AWS momentum and rising earnings estimates present a compelling investment opportunity.Macro headwinds surrounding the company\u2019s prospects, along with challenges of changing consumer spending patterns in its online retail business, which contributes the most to its total revenues, are concerning.Hence, investors should be mindful of these challenges. Maintaining a position in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock appears prudent at present.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy is ordering his employees to return to the office five days a week beginning in January. But the policy isn\u2019t airtight.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority\nThe Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America\u2019s Roads\nCalifornia\u2019s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough\nNew York City\u2019s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways\nTo Build a Happier City, Design for Density\nThe company, which previously required employees to badge in three days a week, will make exceptions for managers already approved for fully remote positions, Jassy said in a Monday note to employees. Flexibility for health concerns and other special situations would also continue.\n\u201cBefore the pandemic, it was not a given that folks could work remotely two days a week, and that will also be true moving forward \u2014 our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances,\u201d he wrote, referencing workers with sick children, house emergencies or those needing a \u201cday or two to finish coding in a more isolated environment.\u201d\nMandated policies, however, don\u2019t always translate into full-scale adherence.\n\u201cThe issue with RTO is compliance,\u201d said Prithwiraj Choudhury, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who studies remote work. \u201cYou might have a memo, but how do you ensure people follow your memo?\u201d\nAmazon joins a number of other high-profile companies, like Citigroup Inc., Walmart Inc., and carmaker Stellantis NV, in tightening return-to-office requirements in the last several months. At some of the companies, those who didn\u2019t agree to come back to an office were let go.\nEven so, the amount of time workers spend working in offices hasn\u2019t ticked up all that much since the beginning of last year. Offices across the US are still only about half as full as they were before the pandemic, according to badge swipe data from security firm Kastle Systems.\nThat\u2019s partly because work norms and practices have changed so substantially since the pandemic. In the US, people worked remotely about one or two days a month before 2020, according to data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Four years on, people \u201care now used to working in a different way,\u201d Choudhury said. \u201cExceptions might become the norm.\u201d\nChoudhury said he expects some of Amazon\u2019s top performers to quit as a result of Jassy\u2019s newest mandate. He also said a shift back to stricter in-office rules could impact the company\u2019s ability to attract women and people of color. Researchers at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania found that job postings that advertise remote work attract a substantially more diverse pool of applicants.\nStill, many CEOs around the world are digging in.\nChris Ellison, CEO of Australian mining company Mineral Resources Ltd. said he has a \u201cno work-from-home\u201d policy and a headquarters office with a cafe, restaurant, gym, daycare, and wellness center. \u201cI don\u2019t want them leaving the building,\u201d he said on an earnings call last month. \u201cI want to hold them captive all day long.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool\nTrump\u2019s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection\nThe Host of Hot Ones Spills the Secrets of His Success\nHow a Former IRS Agent Got Locked Up in a Nigerian Prison\nThe Fed Risks a Political Backlash by Spurring Economy Close to Election\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Inside the secretive design studio of Amazon\u2019s robo-taxi company Zoox as it readies for paying customers",
        "Author": "  Jessica Mathews ",
        "Text": "The industrial design studio of robo-taxi company Zoox is tucked behind a password-protected door in an office near San Francisco. Inside, a small team of designers at the Amazon-owned startup have been tinkering with clay, carbon fiber, colors, and fabrics\u2014largely in secret.\nOn Tuesday morning, Nahuel Battaglia, the team\u2019s original designer, is shyly pointing to his decade-old sketches of the futuristic car he hoped to help build. The old drawings, in many ways, resemble the car that Zoox plans to finally debut for paying riders in Las Vegas later this year or early next in a high-stakes race to catch up to Waymo, the robo-taxi arm of Google\u2019s parent company.\n\u201cThat was one of our key sketches, that brown and grey sketch up here,\u201d Battaglia says, pointing to a drawing from 2015 that shows a vehicle without a driver's seat, steering wheel, and foot pedals.\u00a0In another big departure, the front seats face backwards so that passengers face each other like at a cafe table, since no one really needs to be watching the road in a driverless car.\nWhile Waymo has charged for rides in its modified Jaguars in San Francisco and now a few other cities for more than two years, Zoox is less well known. That\u2019s partly because of the company\u2019s decision to keep its vehicles secret for the first six years while its designers tinkered with them. Its cars are also far less frequently on the road for training runs. Currently, the vehicles, which have been compared to cute \u201ctoasters\u201d for their boxy shape\u2014are limited to a one-mile route between two Zoox offices in Foster City, Calif., and within a five-mile radius of the company's Las Vegas office, driving at up to 45 miles per hour. Zoox wouldn\u2019t specify exactly how many vehicles it has, nor how many are on the road, though a U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration safety probe suggests it has at least 500 conventional cars retrofitted with its LiDAR technology that helps them navigate autonomously.\nOn Tuesday, for the first time, Zoox invited a handful of reporters into its design studio to speak with those creating the car and deciding the colors, materials, and finishes that will go into it. Several Zoox staffers were clearly excited to share the rationale behind its green and black color scheme, its sunroof with star-like lights, and the shimmery sound the vehicle makes as the doors open. I caught several Zoox design staffers grinning at their desks as they watched reporters react to the car\u2019s horn, which sounds like a muted train whistle.\nOnly recently has the team been able to invite outsiders to see what they\u2019ve been working on. In April, Zoox started letting family and friends ride between its Foster City route. While sitting next to me in the prototype vehicle, Chris Stoffel, Zoox\u2019s director of industrial and creative design, told me his family members became emotional when they took a ride for the first time earlier this year. \u201cThey cried,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think that they've seen so much investment and time going into developing a product from the ground up,\u201d he said.\nBased on the short ride I took in Foster City, there still seem to be kinks to be worked out. Shortly after car started moving, the seat belt tightened aggressively around me, and the vehicle accelerated a little too quickly for my taste. On the way back, I was seated backwards, which is not a particularly good idea for someone like myself who struggles with motion sickness.\u00a0But the ride itself went smoothly, with the Zoox staying within the road lanes, performing turns, and parking perfectly when the ride ended.\nZoox now employs more than 2,500 people, according to the company, although the team that\u2019s in charge of its industrial design is rather small, with about a dozen to 15 people coming into the studio daily, according to Stoffel. Battaglia, who forgivingly smiled as people repeatedly mispronounced his first name, was the startup\u2019s first industrial designer.\nZoox has continued to tweak its vehicle as it prepares for commercial launch. Karoline Huber, a senior designer at Zoox who's focused on the materials that go into the vehicle, showed off the latest clay and wood model of a Zoox split in half that revealed the lighter green fabrics and finishes of the new design.\nThe message that Zoox wants to send with its four-seater vehicles is that its robo-taxis are not cars\u2014but should be thought of as a new form of transportation entirely. Perhaps to underscore this point, there are signs in the parking lot designating spots for the Zoox robo-taxis that say. \u201cRobot parking only.\u201d\nBut it remains to be seen how the public will respond to the futuristic not-car vehicles once they are on the streets in large numbers\u2014and how they will perform when carrying large numbers of passengers.\nAfter all, Waymo has toyed with its own car designs without steering wheels, but has opted to initially deploy cars with driver seats and steering wheels. Meanwhile, GM\u2019s Cruise, which has scaled back its robo-taxi operations after an incident in San Francisco last year in which one of its cars dragged a pedestrian underneath, shelved plans for its so-called Origin after GM CEO Mary Barra said the company \u201cthought it was better to get rid of that risk.\u201d\nIn practical terms, Zoox is making a big gamble with its steering wheel-free vehicles. The benefit of a steering wheel is that operations staff can easily come to the rescue of an autonomous vehicle that is stuck on city streets and drive it away. In an on-stage interview at Fortune\u2019s Brainstorm Tech conference in July, Zoox CEO Aicha Evans explained that, if a Zoox vehicle gets stuck, it will need to be towed if remote assistance fails to do the job. \u201cThat's the worst case scenario,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cthose are very rare\u201d instances and that Zoox can, remotely, \u201cgive commands to the vehicle to pull over or to take itself to a certain destination.\u201d\nEven as Zoox opened the doors to its industrial design studio on Tuesday, the company has retained an element of secrecy to its operation. There were black silk fabric concealing several items in the design studio, including a vehicle prototype. When I asked about them, Stoffel admitted this was because there were reporters around.\n\u201cThere are other things that may never leave the walls of the studio, so we choose to cover them up,\u201d he said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Amazon.com Inc: An Exploration into Its Intrinsic Value",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-09-16, Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $102.83. It's currently trading at a price of $186.49. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -81.36%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$4.26\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.65%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n26.16\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n12.22\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n102.83\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $62.77. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -197.1%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks That Will Ride A $30 Trillion Opportunity According To Morgan Stanley.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other humanoid robot stocks.\nOver the course of the last century, the makeup of modern day society and the world as we know it has significantly changed. Humans living in the first quarter of the 20th century were just starting to get used to automobiles and long distance air travel was still a distant dream for most people.\nNow, with the age of artificial intelligence seemingly upon us, the world has changed. AI, a technology exclusive to science fiction in just the past decade, is now a reality even though its highest firm, i.e. artificial general intelligence, is far from being a reality. Similarly, while factories in the 20th century had to rely on workers for most of their production, now, automation is in full swing.\nNo where is the impact of this clearer than in the factories of Elon Musk's car company. The electric vehicle billionaire has often described his attempts at establishing a viable production base for electric vehicles as \"hell,\" and now, he believes that the future of the world lies in the hands of humanoid robots. So much so that Musk believes that by selling $1 trillion of humanoid robots annually, his company can reach an unbelievable market value of $25 trillion. Right now, it's valued at $708.7 billion after having lost 8.96% year to date, and the combined value of the S&P 500 is $45.7 trillion.\nMusk aims to have the first version of his firm's Optimus humanoid robot in small scale production early next year and start selling the humanoid robot to other companies in 2026. A simple humanoid isn't what one of the world's richest men is talking about though, since the key to his plan of selling robots is autonomy. This is the key valuation driver, believes Musk, as he shared during the Q2 2024 earnings call:\nAnd it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number. ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $5 trillion, I think they are probably not wrong. And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number.\nArk Invest, Cathie Wood's hedge fund which filed $11.2 billion of investments with the SEC for Q2 2024, is also quite bullish on humanoid robots. Calling humanoid robots as generalizable robots, Wood's firm believes that they represent a $24 trillion revenue opportunity. This opportunity is split even between household and manufacturing robots, with the investment firm outlining that even a 50% take rate coupled with a 50% productivity boost could lead to a $7.1 trillion revenue opportunity for humanoid robots. Looking ahead, Ark Invest believes that humanoid robots will \"have grown to 10% of the number of humans in the manufacturing workforce\" by 2030 - in an era where cheap \"robots in human form-factors have begun to populate households\" to \"address a third of household chores\" and be an attractive purchase because of the time that they help people save.\nCathie Wood and Elon Musk aren't the only ones who are convinced about the potential that humanoid robots offer. Another big believer is the investment bank, Morgan Stanley. It believes that the biggest potential of humanoid robots is the cost savings that they can offer. As per analyst Adam Jonas' estimates, these robots can \"bring about cost savings of roughly $500,000 to $1 million per human worker over 20 years.\" These savings will come at a hairline of a fraction of the cost, with the bank's estimates sharing that they could cost anywhere between $10,000 to $30,000 to manufacture.\nThe investment bank's estimates also believe that by 2030, America could have as many as 40,000 humanoid robots helping humans. Talking about overall usage, the industrial and other uses of humanoids could lead to a wage impact of $1 billion. These wage impacts grow as we move further down the future, and peak in 2050 when the bank believes that the humanoid population will be at an unbelievable 68 million for a wage impact of a whopping $3 trillion. Of course, the robots that the bank has envisioned aren't your everyday run of the mill equipment.\nThese will use artificial intelligence, which naturally expands the investment options for investors looking to profit from this potential growth. As per analyst Ed Stanley, the list of potential contenders for investment as humanoid robot stocks includes \"companies making the generative AI that will power the robots\u2019 brains, the mechanics that make their bodies run, and the battery storage needed to power them. Further development in those three areas will be key to achieving humanoid commercialization..\"\nIf you thought that we were done with trillion dollar estimates for the humanoid robot industry, you'd be wrong. Another such estimate comes from the management consulting firm Roland Berger. It believes that if the sector scales according to optimistic projections, then by 2050, 50 million humanoid robots could generate $1.5 trillion in revenue. However, the firm does caution that this optimism is contingent on \"heavily dependent on technological progress and the regulatory environment\" as regulatory scrutiny of humanoids is benign right now as the majority of them are currently prototypes.\nOur Methodology\nWe used Morgan Stanley\u2019s Humanoid 66 stock list. for our list of the biggest beneficiaries of the humanoid robot race. This list is divided into three categories, humanoid enablers and beneficiaries, enablers, and beneficiaries. From these three, we selected the top stocks from the beneficiaries list. If you're interested in the other two categories, be sure to check out $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 302\nAmazon.com, Inc. (\u00e7\u00e7) is the biggest eCommerce company in the world. It operates close to 200 mega fulfillment centers worldwide, which offers it a wide base to benefit from humanoid robots. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also a high technology company courtesy of its semiconductor design and consumer electronics businesses. This means that the firm has an adequate technological base that it can leverage to introduce humanoids in its warehouses. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s use of Kiva mobile robots in its warehouses has cut down click to ship times by 78%, and its partnership with Anthropic also provides it with a large artificial intelligence platform to make up the \"brains\" of humanoid robots as envisaged by Morgan Stanley. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also an early mover in the humanoid space as it started testing these robots in US warehouses in 2023. Since it still relies on eCommerce for most of its revenue, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s stock performance depends on economic conditions. Additionally, it could see additional tailwinds from humanoids through a reported new business division targeting supply chains and logistics.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) believes that using robots will help it cut costs as management shared during the Q2 2024 earnings call:\n\"As we pursue these initiatives, we remain focused on lowering our cost to serve. We have a number of opportunities to further reduce costs, including expanding our use of automation and robotics, further building out our same-day facility network, and regionalizing our inbound network.\"\nOverall AMZN ranks 5th on our list of the best humanoid robot stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 12, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.\nWall Street darling NVIDIA Corp. saw its market capitalization climb to $2.61 trillion from $358 billion two years ago with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). However, NVIDIA stock\u2019s unparalleled surge this year hit a speed bump lately due to the violation of antitrust laws, and AI bubble qualms.\nMeanwhile, CEO Jensen Huang has sold NVIDIA\u2019s shares, which makes us wonder whether the chipmaker has the potential to increase shareholder wealth. Let\u2019s have a look \u2013\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filings revealed last week that Huang off-loaded more than $633 million of the chipmaker\u2019s stock since June. Huang has sold shares in tranches of 120,000 each from June 13 to Sept. 5, which accounts for almost 5.3 million shares.\nOn Friday, NVIDIA\u2019s shares posted their worst two-week stretch in two years, while the world\u2019s most sought-after AI player was subjected to wild price swings over the past month that dwarfed even the most volatile assets like cryptocurrency.\nGeopolitical tensions to legal issues plagued NVIDIA, with the stock witnessing a $279 billion wipeout in a single trading session last week. The U.S. Department of Justice subpoenaed NVIDIA in a mounting antitrust issue.\nDoes this sound depressing? Fear not; the NVIDIA stock has an upside potential, and remaining bullish would reap benefits in the long run. Here are the positive reasons \u2013\nInvestors are waiting for the rollout of the cutting-edge new Blackwell chips. However, engineering snags have delayed the process. NVIDIA has been addressing the design flaws in the Blackwell B200 chip and aims to launch it by the year-end. So, the delay period is not long enough to impact the NVIDIA stock\u2019s 2025 results.\nMicrosoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms, Inc. have already ordered Blackwell chips worth billions of dollars, and Amazon.com, Inc. is expected to move from Hopper to Blackwell.\nNVIDIA confirmed that the demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply and may continue into the next fiscal year. After all, the Blackwell platform has more AI throughput than the current Hopper platform. The new Blackwell graphic processing unit (GPU) has greater processing power, which is the most pressing need. It holds 208 billion transistors, way more than the 80 billion in the present H100 CHIP. Also, Blackwell\u2019s NVLink offers high-speed communication, which is the need of the hour.\nThus, strong demand for the Blackwell chip is expected to boost the NVIDIA stock following its launch. Lest we forget, NVIDIA\u2019s shares surged by double digits in the three months following the launch of two previous architectures \u2014 Hopper in the fall of 2022 and Ampere in the spring of 2020.\nIn the dot-com bubble, companies\u2019 shares scaled upward based on hype before the real impact of their business models could be felt. However, AI has become an integral part of all businesses. According to Markets and Markets, the AI industry is poised to expand from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion in 2030.\nNVIDIA is well-poised to make the most of the flourishing AI industry since its chips are essential for AI models deployed across several verticals, including cloud computing. This explains why the company\u2019s H100 graphic cards have huge demand in the AI chip market. Moreover, unlike the stocks in the Internet bubble, NVIDIA has solid fundamentals that validate the company\u2019s stretched valuations, and squash bubble fears.\nNVIDIA has generated profits competently since its return on equity (ROE) is almost 120%, which is way higher than the Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s 73.2%. Notably, any ROE above 100% shows that the company\u2019s net income is more than its equity, or the performance is strong.\nNVIDIA\u2019s net profit margin is 55%, above the industry\u2019s 47.6%. Any net margin of 20% indicates the company can curtail costs and generate profits.\nWhat\u2019s more, NVIDIA recently approved a stock buyback worth $50 billion, indicating a healthy corporate organization. Share repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares and increase the value of the remaining shares, which bodes well for shareholders.\nBeing the worldwide leader in GPUs, NVIDIA\u2019s stock will benefit. Huge data is expected to migrate from central processing units to GPUs, per Huang. According to Precedence Research, the GPU market will expand from $56.55 billion in 2023 to $1,414.39 billion by 2034.\nNVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with Siemens to enter the metaverse space and the introduction of GeForce in the growing gaming market will act as a tailwind for the company. As a result, the $2.80 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s earnings per share is up 76.1% yearly.\nBanking on the highly anticipated launch of the groundbreaking Blackwell chips, inherent capability to crush bubble concerns, the introduction of stock buyback plans, and a dominant player in the semiconductor space gives NVIDIA\u2019s shares the fuel to scale northward despite the current hiccups.\nProminent brokers, thus, have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 40.2% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $106.47. The analysts\u2019 highest price target is $200, indicating an upside of 87.9%.\nMoreover, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average year to date, a tell-tale long-term uptrend. This is why investors should hang on to this multi-bagger stock and not let it go.\nNVIDIA stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Among The Best Cloud Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers?",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Cloud Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other cloud stocks.\nThe cloud computing market is one of the fastest growing in the technology industry as the ubiquity of the internet allows business to digitally outsource their functions to reduce investment costs and access specialized services. Estimates show that the cloud computing market was worth $480 billion in 2022, and despite its heft, it is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% to be worth a whopping $2.2 trillion by the end of 2032. The three segments of the cloud computing industry are infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS).\nREAD ALSO\u00a013 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers\u00a0and\u00a08 Best EV Stocks According to Short Seller Sentiment\nThis market, like other mega technology industries, is dominated by mega cap technology companies. As per research from Gartner, the global IaaS market is dominated by five services as of 2023 end. These are AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Aliyun, and Huawei Cloud. Their market shares are 39%, 23%, 8.2%, 7.9%, and 4.3%, respectively, with all other firms commanding 17.6% of the total market. In terms of revenue, AWS raked in an impressive $54.6 billion in revenue, while the others brought in $32.1 billion, $11.4 billion, $11.1 billion, and $5.9 billion, respectively. AWS' dominance in the industry is clear as it brought in more than twice the revenue of all other firms that follow Huawei since their cumulative revenue was $24.6 billion.\nApart from the biggest players, whose valuation metrics are different due to their mature and diverse business models, valuing cloud computing stocks is different from how you'd value other companies. For instance, most firms are valued through their price to earnings (P/E) ratio. This measures the premium that investors are willing to pay for a firm's earnings, but the ratio becomes useless when we try it to value cloud computing stocks. This is because of the industry's obsession with growth, and its need for high margins, meaning that cloud cloud computing stocks, and particularly SaaS stocks, reinvest large portions of their revenue back into growth.\nSo much so that one of the most troubled SaaS companies these days has been aggressively investing in growth despite its shares being down 39.65% year to date. This firm ranks 6th on our list of Ray Dalio\u2019s Top 10 Growth Stock Picks with 30+% Revenue Growth, with its second quarter product revenue of $868.8 million marking a 28.9% annual growth. However, this growth clearly hasn't been enough, as the stock tumbled by 14.7% after the latest earnings report. During the same period, this firm's marketing and research and development expenses sat at $838.2 million, or 96% of its revenue. This is a classic illustration of the cloud computing industry, and one that requires different valuation metrics than the P/E ratio as these firms are not profitable most of the time.\nThe two key metrics for valuing SaaS stocks in particular are the EV/Revenue and the Rule of 40. A firm's enterprise value is its market value plus net debt, and when divided by revenue, the resulting ratio measures the premium that a buyer would be willing to pay for a firm over its ability to generate revenue. The Rule of 40 is simpler, as it simply states that the sum of a SaaS firm's revenue growth rate and profit margin should exceed 40. While this rule is simply a benchmark and not all inclusive of SaaS performance, it does have some key implications. For instance, it implies that if a firm is growing its revenue at or faster than 40%, then it can be unprofitable.\nOn the flip side, if growth slows down, to say 10%, then it must be highly profitable with margins of at least 30% to show that the lower growth is accompanied by the benefits of the beefy margins that software companies enjoy. McKinsey also substitutes the profit margin with the free cash flow (FCF) margin to further broaden this rule's scope. A firm's FCF simply eliminates the impact of interest, taxes, and capital expenditure on the net income. As per its analysis, the top Rule of 40 SaaS companies are investor favorites. This is because McKinsey's data shows that in a sample size of 100 SaaS companies, those with the 25 highest Rule of 40 scores had median EV/Revenue multiples of 22. This was nearly 22x the overall sample's 11x, and nearly 3x the bottom 25 firms' median EV/Revenue multiples of 8. In other words, investors are typically willing to pay a higher premium over sales for SaaS firms that have either robust revenue growth, superior cost control, or a mix of both.\nFinally, while EV/Revenue and Rule of 40 measure the financial validity and stature of these firms, their stock performance is also tightly linked to the economy and monetary policy. A low interest regime means that businesses can spend more money, which is beneficial for SaaS and cloud computing firms, both. On Wall Street, August has marked a paradigm shift after Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that his organization was satisfied with macroeconomic indicators to cut interest rates. This has also impacted valuations, as the median EV/Sales ratio for the top companies, i.e. Rule of 40 firms with a growth rate higher than 30%, sat at 13.3x as of the latest market close. This is the second highest for the year, with the last high being in May when it sat at 16.3x. This was before a brief rate gloom took over Wall Street in July which saw the flagship S&P index lose 8.5% between mid July and early August.\nAny discussion of SaaS stocks would be incomplete without a brief discussion of the implications of artificial intelligence. According to hedge fund Coatue Management, SaaS valuations as measured by forward sales are at a historic low right now through a median of 5.5x. This comes with lower growth expectations, as just 1% of SaaS firms are now seeing a median forward growth estimate of 30%+. As for the business model, SaaS firms are seeing a shift from a traditional seat based model that drove revenue from the number of users that were using the services to a consumption driven model. Their lower growth expectations are also somewhat driven by the belief that AI could allow companies to cost effectively create their own code and thereby reduce their reliance on SaaS and cloud computing providers.\nOur Methodology \nTo make our list of the best cloud stocks to buy according to short sellers, we ranked the holdings of First Trust's cloud ETF by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short. Then, the stocks with the lowest percentage were selected.\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q2 2024: 308\nShort Interest as % of\u00a0 Shares Outstanding: 0.77%\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology focused firm known for its strong presence in the cloud computing and the eCommerce industries. More than 80% of its revenue is from eCommerce, which means that the typical drivers of eCommerce valuation are also relevant for the company. These include reducing delivery times and growing its premium membership services. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also the world's biggest cloud computing company in terms of market share. As per Gartner, the firm controls 39% of the cloud market through its AWS business division. This introduces a high margin revenue stream for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). AWS has an operating margin of 24% as per Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s latest financial results, which is 20 percentage points higher than its North American eCommerce operations' margin of 3.8% and the overall margin of 5.7%. Through AWS and its broader technology focus, the firm is also concentrating on all three layers of the AI stack. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) benefits from its access to the Claude AI foundational model too, and its eCommerce market share provides it with a wide moat.\nPatient Capital mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.\"\nOverall AMZN ranks 5th on our list of the best cloud stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fortune 500 Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other Fortune 500 stocks.\nThe aggregate revenue of the Fortune 500 companies in 2023 reached a record $41 trillion, up 0.1% year-over-year. Profits also rose 2% after declining earlier in 2022. The US took the lead from Greater China with the most companies on the Fortune 500 list for the first time since 2018. It has 139 companies as of August this year, an increase of 3 from 2023, while Greater China has 133 companies, down 9 from last year.\nThe financial sector, including banks and insurance companies, led all industries with the most Fortune 500 companies. Collectively tech giants brought in $282 billion in net income, up from $233 billion the previous year. Currently, 13 companies are making their Fortune 500 debut, reflecting the world's fascination with AI and weight-loss drugs.\nWhile the S&P 500 has recovered most of its losses, the rebound is being led by sectors like real estate, utilities, and consumer staples rather than major tech companies. Investors are shifting focus due to concerns over economic growth and expectations of Fed rate cuts.\nStill, it seems like investors think that while investment portfolios should be diversified given the current economic conditions, this sentiment does not imply divesting from tech stocks, which of course contribute greatly to the aggregate Fortune 500 revenue. Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management head of Americas Asset Allocation, emphasized this sentiment and we covered this earlier in our article about the 10 Best Tech Stocks To Buy Right Now Under $10:\n\u201c...investors should view potential dips in tech stocks as good long-term buying opportunities, as 10% corrections are historically good entry points in tech... He thinks that this market volatility is acyclical. The recent sell-off in the tech sector was not primarily due to economic concerns but rather to sector-specific issues. Despite this, tech giants will continue to benefit from the AI CapEx investment story. While there may be short-term challenges, the long-term outlook for these companies remains positive... Draho also cautioned against over-concentrating portfolios in the sector. He suggested diversifying exposure by investing in sector leaders as well as companies likely to benefit from tech disruption as a way to manage potential downside risks in tech stocks.\u201d\nJust last week, Dan Greenhaus, Solus Alternative Asset Management's chief strategist discussed markets, and the rebound's staying power, all while suggesting that predicting the Fed's next move had become more difficult.\nHe discussed the ongoing recession concerns, particularly after negative comments from financial representatives. Despite these worries, he believes the US consumer is performing well, the economy is stable, and corporate profits are exceeding expectations. This context suggests that the recent sell-off in certain AI stocks was followed by a justified rebound, as issues appear limited to recent trends.\nThe S&P 500 is currently facing resistance around the 5,600 level, a key point of concern for investors. Dan Greenhaus noted that the recent inversion of the yield curve raised anxiety but the 2-10-year curve is slightly positive. Despite these worries, credit spreads for investment-grade bonds remain stable, and overall cross-asset indicators suggest a stable market environment.\nRecently, discussions around potential interest rate changes have gained momentum, particularly following insights from Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. He indicated a likely 25 basis point cut by the Federal Reserve, although he also acknowledged the possibility of a 50 basis point reduction. Greenhaus believes the Fed will opt for a 25 basis point cut, marking the start of a series of reductions. This perspective is supported by the normalization of inflation and a slowing economy.\nAccording to Greenhaus, the cyclical components of the stock market appear to be performing well, indicating that the overall economic fundamentals remain robust, and there is no concrete case for any specific rate cut scenario. As Fortune 500 companies continue to generate record revenues and profits as well, investor sentiments should not be shifting drastically. With that being said, we're here with a list of 10 best Fortune 500 stocks to buy now.\nMethodology\nWe first looked at the list of Fortune 500 companies, as of 2024. We then selected 10 stocks from these Fortune 500 companies that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nMarket Capitalization as of September 14: $1961.21 billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is engaged in e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence, and is considered one of the Big Five American technology companies. It started by selling books online but now offers a massive selection of products across various categories. Beyond e-commerce, it owns AWS, a dominant cloud computing platform, and has a significant presence in digital streaming with Prime Video.\nAs of Q2 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is held by 308 hedge funds. From these, the highest stake is valued at $8,460,561,806 by Fisher Asset Management.\nThe company remains a leader in online retail and cloud computing. AWS is its most profitable segment, boasting over 30% margins, though it faces increasing competition from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. AWS is projected to grow annually by 15% to 21% through 2028, making its performance a crucial factor in the company's future profits. AWS increased its revenue by 18.8% year-over-year in Q2 2024.\nAmazon Prime has also evolved into a major success led by 200 million global members and enhancing customer loyalty. The subscription service drives higher spending among members and is approaching an annual run rate of $100 billion, alongside significant growth in Advertising Services. However, physical stores, including Whole Foods Market, remain the smallest and slowest-growing revenue stream for the company.\nHayden Capital stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cOur portfolio is still recovering from the 2022 downturn, although we\u2019ve made meaningful progress in the last two years. While that experience has taught us many lessons, that dislocation also provided a rich vein of opportunities that we continue to mine today.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best Fortune 500 stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Greg McKenna ",
        "Text": "Intel\u2019s long and hard fall from grace is no secret. After a brutal year for both the company and its stock, however, shares of one of Silicon Valley\u2019s original giants have surged 14% after the beleaguered chipmaker announced a deal with Amazon to produce advanced AI chips.\nIntel has a long-running partnership with Amazon Web Services, the biggest cloud service provider in the world. Now, the two companies will co-invest in a custom semiconductor known as a \u201cfabric chip\u201d that will be built in a new factory under construction outside Columbus, Ohio. Intel also announced its struggling foundry business, which has fallen well behind the likes of TSMC, will become an independent subsidiary with the ability to raise outside capital.\nEarlier in the day, the Biden administration had officially revealed it would award Intel up to $3 billion in CHIPS Act funding as part of an effort called the Secure Enclave, which aims to ensure a steady supply of cutting-edge chips for defense and intelligence purposes. That\u2019s in addition to a $8.5 billion grant awarded to the company in February for several major construction projects, including the plant in Ohio.\nAfter a big Monday of news, Intel\u2019s long-suffering stock surged 8% in extended trading before rising another 6% as of midday Tuesday. The stock is still down over 50% year-to-date as investors await further signs of a recovery they're hoping for under CEO Pat Gelsinger.\nOnce the biggest chipmaker in the world, Intel\u2019s market cap now sits below $100 billion, outside the industry\u2019s top 10 as the likes of Nvidia, Broadcom, and even Texas Instruments have surged far ahead. The company\u2019s recent performance also stands in contrast to another legacy tech name in Oracle, which has revitalized itself and seen its shares rise over 60% in 2024.\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nMonday appears to be a step in the right direction, but Bank of America managing director and senior analyst Vivek Arya said the board\u2019s updates still left more questions than answers. While the AWS win sounded impressive, he wrote in a note published Tuesday morning, Intel has already supplied the cloud giant with CPUs, or computer processing units, for a long time.\nThat market, specifically traditional PC chips, has historically been Intel\u2019s bread and butter business. It\u2019s faltered, however, under competition from Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, whose cheaper and more efficient ARM-CPUs have caused Intel to lose market share. When it comes to advanced AI chips, meanwhile, Intel has been nowhere near Nvidia GPUs, or graphic processing units, which are all but essential for companies training GenAI models.\nSimply put, \u201cthey\u2019re in trouble,\u201d Baird managing director and tech strategist Ted Mortonson said of Intel last week. On Monday, the company said it was more than halfway to its target of slashing 15,000 workers by the end of the year.\nIt's clear Monday\u2019s news, however, gave investors some solace.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "BofA Securities analyst Justin Post maintained a Buy rating on Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a price target of $210.\nThe re-rating reflects CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s goal for a leaner Amazon by the end of the first quarter of 2025, translating into an estimated $700 million in cost savings and Amazon Web Services\u2019 multi-year, multi-billion-dollar co-investment into custom AI chips with Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC).\nPost noted that Intel chips would be more cost-effective for customers than alternatives. Intel will produce custom AI fabric chips for AWS that will be built on Intel 18A, the company\u2019s most advanced process node.\nAccording to the analyst, AWS remains well-positioned to capture broad-based AI customer demand due to its more diverse and growing product offering.\nPost estimates $700 million annually in cost savings under Jassy\u2019s plans to increase Amazon\u2019s individual contributor-to-manager ratio by slashing management layers\u00a0and making employees return to the office five days a week beginning in January.\nAssuming a non-warehouse workforce of 400,000 and a current manager-to-contributor ratio of 1 to 6, at least 2.5% of employees (around 7,000) are projected to shift from manager roles to contributor positions, and if the difference in pay is $100,000.\nPost\u2019s price target is based on his sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) analysis, which values the 1P retail business at 1.2 times 2025E Revenue, the 3P retail business at 3.0 times 2025E Revenue, AWS at 8.0 times 2025 Sales, and the advertising business at 5.0 times 2025 Sales.\nFor 2025E, Post\u2019s 8.0 times AWS multiple is relatively below his SaaS comps at 8.5 times, his 1.2 times GMV multiple is a discount to his retail comps at 1.3 times, and his 5.0 times advertising multiple is a discount to his digital advertising comps at 5.2 times.\nThe analyst deems some conglomerate discounts as warranted with elevated regulatory risk but long-term notes that in-line to discount multiples are warranted given growth rates more than peers.\nPrice Action: AMZN stock is up 1.22% at $187.15 at the last check on Tuesday.\nImage via Shutterstock\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nMar 2022\nDeutsche Bank\nInitiates Coverage On\nBuy\nFeb 2022\nTigress Financial\nMaintains\nBuy\nFeb 2022\nCredit Suisse\nMaintains\nOutperform\nView More Analyst Ratings for AMZN\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the\u00a08 Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy According to Analysts.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy.\n2024 will go down in history as the year that legendary investor Warren Buffett started showing signs of slowing down after an illustrious career in the investment world. After losing his best friend and longtime partner, Charlie Munger, the Oracle of Omaha increasingly shows signs of relinquishing control of his investment empire.\nEven with his investment company becoming the first non-tech giant to hit the $1 trillion mark on market cap, Buffett is slowly relinquishing control after years of tremendous success. Handpicked Greg Abel is now responsible for taking over the Buffett Empire after more than 60 years in the limelight.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Carl Icahn Stock Portfolio: 7 Best Stocks to Buy\u00a0and\u00a010 Best Performing Warren Buffett Stocks in 2024.\nAs Abel assumes control in making key investment decisions, Buffett continues sending shockwaves. Nevertheless, he has become a net seller, having trimmed stakes in some high-profile holdings, all but raising concerns about the market outlook.\nAt 94, Buffett has seen it all, having outperformed the S&P 500 over the years and generated significant returns for his investors. Since 1965, the billionaire investor has averaged returns of 19.8% through his investment firm, nearly double the 10.2% return of the S&P 500 over the same period. Nevertheless, he appears to have hit the peak of his investment career as he became a net seller after one of the longest bull runs.\nThe recent sales have taken Buffett\u2019s cash haul to the $300 billion mark, which he can use to purchase a good chunk of the S&P 500 companies. Nevertheless, the billionaire investor has shown reluctance to invest in the cash-sitting valuations that have gotten out of hand.\nSince Buffett has yet to carry out a massive investment this year, it does not come as a surprise. The advocate of value investing, which involves analyzing the market for undervalued stocks likely to generate long-term value, has been skeptical about valuations.\nHis reluctance also comes on outperformance in recent years, becoming extremely difficult due to the sheer size of Buffett\u2019s investment portfolio. \u201cWe have no possibility of eye-popping performance\u201d given that \u201cthere remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others,\u201d Buffett is quoted as saying in an interview with CNBC.\nWith the S&P 500 up by more than 20% for the year, Buffett has indicated that the market might be too expensive to pursue opportunities at current levels. Consequently, he has opted to stay in cash while locking in profits through buybacks and dividends in some of his top investment plays.\nNevertheless, the market is still full of some of the best Warren Buffett stocks that analysts see material upside to. In the aftermath of the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rateby 50 basis points and indicating the prospects of further cuts before year-end, opportunities are increasingly emerging around some of Buffett\u2019s top investment plays\nEven as Buffett waits for the market to correct to deploy the more than $300 billion at his disposal, there are still opportunities to pursue as interest rates trend down. With that, let\u2019s look at the 8 best Warren Buffett stocks to buy according to analysts.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the best Warren Buffett stocks to buy according to analysts, we sifted through\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s\u00a0Q2 2024 13F portfolio. We scanned all the 13F holdings and picked the 8 stocks that had the highest upside potential, as of September 24. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their upside potential.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Q2 2024 Stake: $1.93 Billion\nAnalyst Upside Potential, as of September 26: 15.96%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is arguably one of the best Warren Buffett Stocks to buy, according to analysts. It\u2019s a market leader in e-commerce and cloud computing. Additionally, the company\u2019s increased focus on artificial intelligence has made it a firm favorite amid the AI frenzy.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s entry into the generative AI sector has generated the highest level of excitement for its stock in the last 24 months. Yet, the truth behind this excitement goes beyond mere speculation. Users of Amazon\u2019s AI offerings are discovering real benefits from them. As Amazon continues to pour resources into enhancements and new functionalities, it ought to maintain its leading role in cloud computing and secure a larger portion of the market.\nThanks to the integration of AI features, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) recorded an 18.8% increase in sales growth in the second quarter under its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. While AI represents one of the biggest catalysts that continue to fuel Amazon\u2019s underlying growth, advertising is also emerging as an important segment.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s advertising division has been one of its most rapidly expanding areas, experiencing a 20% increase in revenue from the previous year, or a $2 billion rise. It already boasts unparalleled visibility for advertisers looking to reach Amazon shoppers through its sponsored ads on its online shopping site, and its latest feature, an ad-supported Prime video service, is opening up new avenues for both advertisers and Amazon.\nThe online shopping sector is also showing steady growth, with more units sold than in sales as shoppers look for cheaper deals. Growth in e-commerce and advertising on the cloud should continue diversifying and strengthening Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s revenue base, allowing it to generate long-term value.\nWhile the company trades at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 32, it is expected to enjoy robust growth in various segments. Analysts on Wall Street rate the stock as a buy with a $223.25 price target, implying 15.96% upside potential.\nOverall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds, and\u00a0Fisher Asset Management\u00a0was the largest shareholder.\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here is\u00a0what the firm said:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon\u2019s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.\u201d\nOverall AMZN\u00a0ranks 6th on our list of 8 Best Warren Buffett stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Hence, the new partnership suggests that cloud providers have a sizable opportunity to unlock demand for infrastructure and applications using data housed within Oracle\u2019s databases.\nAccording to Oracle, partnerships with leading Cloud providers are already driving growth. AWS CEO Matt Garman also spoke at an investor conference, outlining optimism for artificial intelligence demand and AWS\u2019 differentiated infrastructure.\nDespite concerns about AI-related disruption to AWS\u2019 strong Cloud industry position, Post said the CEO commentary suggests optimism on AI-related demand and differentiated AWS AI infrastructure to drive client wins.\nAlso, Amazon is walking a fine line between promoting its cost-efficient infrastructure and featuring Nvidia Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) strong GPU capabilities. Still, he flagged customer choice as a differentiated and compelling offering.\nThe price target reflects Post\u2019s Sum Of The Parts\u00a0(SOTP) analysis, which values the 1P retail business at 1.2 times 2025E Revenue (including subscription and Prime membership fees), the 3P retail business at 3.0 times 2025E Revenue, AWS at 8.0 times 2025 Sales, and the advertising business at 5.0 times 2025 Sales.\nFor 2025E, Post\u2019s 8.0 times AWS multiple is relatively below the analyst\u2019s SaaS comps at 8.5 times, his 1.2 times GMV multiple is a discount to his retail comps at 1.3 times, and his 5.0 times advertising multiple is a discount to his digital advertising comps at 5.2 times, which are warranted given growth rates in excess of peers.\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Oracle, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Oracle, the 200-day moving average sits at $123.04, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $156.09. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal.

        "Author": "  Barbara Nascimento, Eric Roston and Simone Iglesias ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Much of Brazil is burning as tens of thousands of fires rage around the country, half of them in the Amazon rainforest. Exacerbated by a severe drought, the fires threaten one of the world\u2019s most crucial ecosystems and are consuming the Amazon\u2019s vast stores of carbon, sending more of the damaging greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority\nThe Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America\u2019s Roads\nCalifornia\u2019s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough\nNew York City\u2019s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways\nBelfast\u2019s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland\u2019s Public Transport\n2.4 million hectares (about 6 million acres) of forests, fields and pastures in the Amazon burned between June and August. There were more than 95,000 hot spots in the Amazon biome this year to Sept. 18, according to data from Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research, known as Inpe.\nThe fires emitted 31.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent between June and August, says the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, or Ipam. That represents an annual increase of 60% and is roughly on par with the emissions from running eight coal-fired power plants for a year.\nThe Amazon is one of the world\u2019s most important carbon sinks, said Lucas Ferrante, a biologist and researcher at both Sao Paulo University and the Federal University of Amazonas. \u201cNow, it is emitting carbon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are at a turning point.\u201d\nAlthough fires are common during the country\u2019s dry season, this year\u2019s anomalies are a red flag for experts.\n\u201cThe timing of the fires and how long it is lasting is what is worrying us,\u201d said Ritaumaria Pereira, executive director at Imazon, a nonprofit focused on research and projects in the Amazon region. \u201cThings have gotten out of control, and the name for that is climate change.\u201d\nWhen rainforests burn\nClimatologists have warned for decades that events like this year\u2019s would come to pass. Droughts in the last two decades have become much more severe and much more common. The last year \u2014 the hottest on record globally \u2014 brought Brazil\u2019s extremes to a new level.\n\u201cThis was always something that we know would happen,\u201d said Michael Coe, senior scientist and tropics program director at the Woodwell Climate Research Center. \u201cBut there\u2019s a huge difference between knowing that it will happen and seeing it happen.\u201d\nWhen rainforests burn, what replaces them can\u2019t replace the carbon storage and evaporative cooling that benefits the global climate. The Amazon is a critical part of the global climate system. Without it, modeling suggests that the Earth could warm another degree Celsius on top of the already dangerous 2.7C or so that\u2019s already in store. Fossil-fuel burning, deforestation and other causes have lifted the global average temperature by about 1.3C since before industrialization.\nAround 40% of the fire spots in Brazil are in areas of primary, or undisturbed, vegetation. The rest are mostly in deforested areas. Deforestation is lower than it has been in years past, an indication of how primed the land is to burn due to hot, dry conditions.\nClimate change worsens fire conditions, said Rodrigo Agostinho, president of Ibama, Brazil\u2019s environmental monitoring agency. \u201cAlthough it is not the climate that starts the fires,\u201d he added.\nIbama says almost all of the fires have been caused by humans, whether deliberately or accidentally. Burning is common in Brazilian agriculture. Historically, Brazil encouraged it as a fast, cheap way to clear land and prepare soil for new planting. The government has banned the practice, although many farmers don\u2019t obey the rule.\nAgostinho said Ibama has gone on a war footing, with thousands of vehicles and hundreds of inspectors, to control the fires. The agency has asked for assistance from neighboring countries, even some that are also dealing with wildfires themselves.\nEnvironment and Climate Change Minister Marina Silva told senators earlier this month that the rainforest is \u201closing humidity\u201d and becoming more vulnerable to fires in a \u201csevere process of climate change.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, she said during a radio interview that \u201cat the moment, any fire is characterized as criminal.\u201d The government wants to stiffen existing penalties for setting fires.\nClouded skies\nSmoke from the fires has already covered a large part of the country and has clouded the sky over far-away S\u00e3o Paulo. The smoke even reached Argentina and Uruguay, according to Climatempo, a climate monitoring service. (Brazil\u2019s smoke is compounded by that from fires in other countries, including Bolivia and Paraguay.)\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva this week announced 514 million reais (about $95 million) to fund emergency measures, including more investigations and hiring specialized firefighters.\nLast year, at the start of his third term in office, Lula returned to the international stage promising to bolster protections for the Amazon, shield tribal lands from resource extraction and spark a green transition of Brazil\u2019s economy. Deforestation went down and a project establishing guidelines for developing sustainable fuels was approved, marking progress toward a cleaner-energy future.\nHowever, the crisis in the Amazon \u2014 captured in photos seen around the world \u2014 may pose a challenge for Lula when he heads to the United Nations General Assembly in New York later this week.\nThe region needs better fire prevention, more investment in firefighting and stepped-up enforcement, said Manoela Machado, a post-doctoral researcher at Woodwell who studies drivers of fire risk in the Amazon.\n\u201cLula is trying to convince the world that Brazil is a climate leader. But there\u2019s some disconnect there in the actual actions on the ground,\u201d Machado said.\n--With assistance from Gabriel Diniz Tavares, Beatriz Amat and Giovanna Serafim.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool\nXbox\u2019s President on Handheld Consoles and Subscription Gaming\nIn Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up\nTrump\u2019s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection\nThe Host of Hot Ones Spills the Secrets of His Success\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Why moves by Amazon and comments by Jamie Dimon don\u2019t threaten an end to remote work benefits",
        "Author": "  Jeanne Sahadi, CNN ",
        "Text": "If your employer lets you work remotely one or more days a week, and you highly value that kind of flexibility, you probably didn\u2019t love hearing last week that Amazon will soon require its corporate employees to return to the office five days a week.\nOr that Dell in a memo asked its global sales team employees who are able to work from a company office to do so five days a week, up from three previously, and noting that \u201cworking remotely should be the exception rather than the routine.\u201d\nOr when AT&T last year announced it was consolidating offices and requiring managers to work on site at least three days a week \u2014 which meant some managers who lived near an office that was closing had to relocate or quit.\nOr even when JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, most of whose employees are already working in the office five days, publicly expressed displeasure last week that more government employees weren\u2019t working on site in federal buildings, which he described as \u201cempty,\u201d according to various news reports.\nWhenever big players publicly change direction and require employees to be in the office full time, the worry is that other employers will follow suit.\nBut for two key reasons, these kinds of public proclamations don\u2019t signal a broader demise of remote work benefits.\nIn the case of Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s memo announcing his new RTO mandate said all the usual things about wanting to strengthen in-person collaboration and company culture.\nBut, importantly, Jassy also highlighted his desire to reduce the glut of managers hired in recent years, which had created more \u201clayers,\u201d including \u201ca longer line of managers feeling like they need to review a topic before it moves forward,\u201d he said. To thin the managerial herd, Jassy called on senior leaders in the company \u201cto increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by at least 15% by the end of Q1 2025.\u201d\nNormally, that might involve manager layoffs. But Amazon said Wednesday that assertion is inaccurate. The effort to increase the ratio of individuals to managers is \u201cnot the same as eliminating roles and would not necessarily involve layoffs,\u201d the company told CNN, noting that it has \u201cno plans to reduce overall headcount as part of this decision.\u201d\nBut by imposing an unpopular mandate to be in the office five days a week, \u201cmiddle managers who have been made wealthy enough will say \u2018I\u2019m leaving,\u2019\u201d said Chris Williams, a former vice president of human resources at Microsoft who is now a leadership consultant to C-suite executives.\nThat saves a company the expense of having to provide severance packages, because people will leave voluntarily.\nJassy\u2019s risk is that too many managers could quit. \u201cHe will solve his near-term problem. But he will have a hard time convincing new hires to commute to downtown Seattle five days a week. So he may have a going-forward recruiting problem,\u201d Williams said.\nIf so, that may require Amazon to eventually \u2014 and quietly \u2014 back off enforcing the new five-days-a-week mandate to attract talent, he suggested.\nWhile an individual company may decide to backtrack on its remote work policies, the numbers suggest that\u2019s not happening widely.\nWorkplace consulting firm Gallup found in May that among full-time employees in remote-capable jobs, 53% work a hybrid schedule, 27% work exclusively remotely and 21% work on site. Those are roughly the same percentages reported in November 2022.\nAs of August 31, job postings on Indeed.com that specify hybrid and remote work have dipped a half percentage point year over year. But that\u2019s primarily because industries that typically have the most remote-capable jobs (e.g., software development) have been hiring less of late, according to Nick Bunker, Indeed\u2019s North American economic research director.\nA Conference Board survey of US workers, meanwhile, found that workplace flexibility is the most important element of total compensation beyond a competitive salary. It also found that HR leaders say hybrid work models help attract and retain talent.\nSo it\u2019s not surprising that Gallup also found that 64% of those working fully remote and 29% who work hybrid said they would be \u201cextremely likely\u201d to look for another job \u201cif your employer decides not to offer opportunities for you to work remote some or all of the time long term.\u201d\nMany CEOs seem to have gotten the memo. The Conference Board in January reported that just 4% of US CEOs said they planned to prioritize bringing people back to the office full time.\nWilliams noted: \u201cI have yet to talk to any enlightened CEO who honestly believes the only way to make a good [workplace] culture is face-to-face.\u201d\nReuters contributed reporting to this article.\nThis story has been updated to include additional context.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

Meanwhile, Amazon has more than 9,000 patents, with 50% filed in the same period, reinforcing its leadership in AI-driven retail innovations.\nWalmart is making significant progress in augmented reality applications such as virtual try-ons and AI-driven store management solutions such as in-store product recognition. The retail giant\u2019s advancements in Smart Factory AI and image-based transactions highlight a shift towards fully automated retail, improving speed and accuracy in customer service.\nAmazon, on the other hand, distinguishes itself with extensive AI deployment in customer personalization and autonomous systems. By pioneering technologies such as Autonomous Network Virtualization and Automated VNF Deployment, the multinational technology company is enhancing its operational infrastructure while setting new benchmarks in network efficiency and data management.\nWalmart's focus on developing intelligent voice assistants and automated store surveillance highlights its interest in creating a seamless and secure shopping experience. Meanwhile, Amazon's advancements in AI for coding and surveillance AI are pushing the boundaries of enterprise AI applications and security enhancements.\nRaj concluded: \u201cWalmart and Amazon's aggressive innovation strategies not only strengthen their market positions but also set a blueprint for the future of the retail sector.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News You Shouldn't Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks you shouldn't miss.\nAI presents significant benefits for investors, primarily through increased efficiency, automation, and the potential for high returns in specific sectors. It leads to higher profitability and efficiency. For example, AI-driven automation enhances efficiency in trading, portfolio management, and operations, helping investors achieve better returns. According to a report by PwC, financial institutions that adopt AI could reduce operational costs by 22% in the short term, which directly improves profitability. Hedge funds, for instance, have seen an increase in efficiency, particularly in areas such as algorithmic trading and risk management. A report by McKinsey suggests that AI-driven trading algorithms can outperform traditional investment strategies by identifying patterns and trends that are hard for human analysts to spot. This advantage could increase returns by 2-3% annually, which can compound into significant gains over time.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nAI tools also provide real-time data analytics and insights, giving investors a competitive edge in making informed decisions. According to a study by Deloitte, 63% of financial executives believe that AI can dramatically improve investment decision-making by providing better market forecasts and risk assessments. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, allowing investors to capitalize on short-term market movements with greater precision. Similarly, the explosion of generative AI and machine learning has led to a surge in stocks related to AI technology. Several AI-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with opportunities for growth. For instance, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has returned close to 30% in the past year, significantly outperforming traditional tech funds.\nTom Kehoe, a top researcher at Alternative Investment Management Association, an investment firm in the United Kingdom, has emphasized that AI is poised to revolutionize investment management, offering greater efficiency and precision in decision-making. Similarly, Larry Fink, the CEO of investment titan BlackRock, believes that AI will be a transformative force for wealth management, allowing firms to personalize portfolios and scale operations efficiently, which in turn create immediate value for investors. Fink was quoted by Financial Times as saying that the collapse of productivity had been a central issue in the global economy. Per Fink, AI had the huge potential to increase productivity, and transform margins across sectors, as it may be the technology that brought down inflation.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the latest and most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Deidre Bosa, a reporter for news platform CNBC, recently claimed that Amazon-backed AI startup Anthropic is on track to generate $1 billion in revenue this year, up 1,000% year-on-year. The increase in revenue represents the explosive growth opportunity in AI, a tech trend that started gaining widespread traction in 2023. Bosa claims that despite the revenue jump, the gross margin of the firm is thinner than a high-quality firm, coming in at only 38%, but that likely has to do with higher upfront costs in developing AI models.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks you shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "If you want to compound wealth in the stock market, you can do so by buying an index fund. But you can do a lot better than that by buying good quality businesses for attractive prices. For example, the Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) share price is 95% higher than it was five years ago, which is more than the market average. It's fair to say the stock has continued its long term trend in the last year, over which it has risen 29%.\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring five years of share price growth, Amazon.com achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 28% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Amazon.com's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nWe're pleased to report that Amazon.com shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 29% over one year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 14% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Before deciding if you like the current share price, check how Amazon.com scores on these 3 valuation metrics.\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of companies that have proven they can grow earnings.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

He once recalled:\n\u201cI remember my dad had made some small investments in a few companies, so I would track them and see how he was doing.\u201d\nTepper bought his first stock when he was in high school \u2014 100 shares of a $2 stock, \u201cbut then the whole thing went bankrupt,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt was a bad investment, but that didn\u2019t deter me.\u201d\nToday, Tepper is worth about $20 billion. He was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn\u2019t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper\u2019s instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he\u2019d joined in 1985.\nTepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the midst of the market crash of 1987.\nAccording to\u00a0The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World\u2019s Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:\n\u201cGoing into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short\u2014I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,\u201d he says with a chuckle. \u201cIt was very cool.\u201d Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn\u2019t do as well. \u201cI still got a raise but not as much as I should have.\u201d\nTepper\u2019s fund Appaloosa Management has released its latest holdings data and it\u2019s time to see which AI stocks are in the billionaire\u2019s portfolio.

He thinks, \u201cif you look hard enough\u201d you will see these tech companies have started to get a \u201clittle bit of a bang\u201d on the bucks they are spending.\nFor Amazon, Mahaney likes \u201cAWS growth acceleration.\u201d\nAWS\u2019s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nJim Cramer often reflects on how he would reform the American education system if it were up to him. According to him, one major change would be to incorporate personal finance education into high school curriculums. He compares this to mandatory health classes that teach practical skills, like dissection, which he finds less relevant compared to financial literacy.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Cramer emphasizes that understanding money is crucial, and not caring about it doesn't make someone virtuous; rather, it can lead to real-life problems like poor credit affecting personal and financial decisions, such as buying a car or a house. He notes that while conventional wisdom says money can't buy happiness, being financially broke is undeniably challenging.\n\"If everyone in this country lost their minds and decided to turn America into Cramerica, you better believe I would make some changes. So, what would the 18th premiere of Jim Cramer look like? Hey, for those of you who didn\u2019t get that reference, Google is your best friend. But because this is a show about money, let\u2019s stick to the more mainstream elements of the Cramerican regime. For starters, it drives me nuts that we don\u2019t really teach our young people how to handle their money. Would it be so crazy if you had to take a class on personal finance before you could graduate from high school? I mean, like those awkward health classes where they show you how to dissect a frog. I mean, come on!\nReflecting on his own experiences, Cramer recalls living in a car while still managing to save for retirement, which he views as a significant accomplishment. He encourages young people to invest early to achieve financial freedom and avoid dependency on their next paycheck. Through the CNBC Investing Club, he aims to guide young investors in managing their finances effectively.\n\"These things matter in life. They say money can't buy happiness, but I've always found that piece of cliche conventional wisdom to be dubious at best. Because, hey, listen, being broke is a major buzzkill, as I know firsthand from the time I spent living in my '78 Ford Fairmont for six months in California. I wish I had an expert to guide me through all this stuff back then. Although I still put money away for retirement while living in my car, I took it out of my homeowner's budget.\nJim Cramer observes that many people begin saving and investing too late, complicating their financial lives more than necessary as they age. He also notes that younger individuals often feel they have plenty of time, sometimes starting to invest before they\u2019re truly prepared. Cramer believes there are more prudent uses for their money at that stage.\n\"Too many people start saving and investing too late, making their lives a lot more difficult than they need to be as they get older. But I also know many young people feel that they have all the time in the world. Some start investing before they're truly ready when there are, in fact, better things for them to do with their money.\"\nCramer then offers three key lessons for young investors, especially recent college graduates. First, he stresses the importance of saving money, even if it\u2019s not intuitive. He suggests investing in the stock market as a way to save, which can be more engaging than just keeping money in a savings account or CD. Investing helps keep your money from being spent impulsively because accessing it requires selling stocks.\nSecond, Cramer advises young investors to embrace higher risk in their portfolios. In their 20s, they can afford to take risks with speculative stocks or options because they have many years to recover from mistakes. In contrast, older investors should adopt more conservative strategies, focusing on safer investments like bonds and utilities. Cramer criticizes the idea of young investors holding a significant percentage of bonds, emphasizing that they should be more aggressive in their investments.\nLastly, Cramer challenges the notion that student loan debt should prevent young people from investing. He notes that student loan interest rates are generally lower than credit card debt and advises starting investments even while managing student loans. He also suggests that delaying student loan payments could be advantageous due to potential future loan forgiveness programs.\n\"Here\u2019s the bottom line for young people just out of college: investing is a great way to trick yourself into saving money you might otherwise spend. Beyond that, remember when you're young, you can afford to take a lot more risk with your portfolio.

        "Text": "Amazon has introduced a new packaging solution in the UK, designed to minimise waste and improve sustainability.\nThe company's innovative paper-padded envelope offers a shockproof, lightweight alternative to traditional plastic-lined packaging.\nDeveloped in collaboration with packaging expert Mondi, the new envelope features a shock-absorbent paper-based lining that effectively protects products during delivery.\nUnlike previous envelopes lined with bubble wrap, this design eliminates the need for plastic, making it fully recyclable at home.\nAmazon's commitment to reducing packaging waste is evident in this latest innovation.\nBy optimising the type, material, and weight of its packaging, the company aims to increase circularity, avoid waste, and reduce carbon emissions without compromising safety or functionality.\nThe paper-padded envelope offers several advantages over traditional packaging.\nIts lightweight design reduces the overall weight of shipments, leading to a significant reduction in packaging materials used.\nAdditionally, the envelope's flexibility allows for efficient packing without wasted space, further minimising environmental impact.\n\u201cAmazon stopped using traditional bubble wrap-padded envelopes in Europe several years ago, which presented a challenge to develop light, flexible and fully recyclable paper packaging that provides the same protection,\u201d said Thais Blumer, European head of Sustainable Packaging for Amazon.\n\u201cAchieving both low weight and maximum protection with a 100% recyclable paper envelope was not an easy task, but these envelopes are easy to pack, simple for customers to recycle at home, and enable damage-free deliveries.\u201d\nThe envelope's strength and resilience come from its specially engineered paper construction and corrugated inner lining.\nDespite its thin profile, Amazon said the packaging provides exceptional protection for products during transit.\nThe new paper-padded envelopes are available in three sizes and can be used to protect a variety of products, including skincare items, health supplements, home and office supplies, and toys.\nAmazon's dedication to sustainable packaging is evident in its broader efforts to reduce waste and carbon emissions.\nMore than 50% of Amazon Europe's shipments now come in reduced, recyclable packaging, and the company said it has avoided more than three million tonnes of unnecessary packaging materials since 2015.\nBy reducing packaging, Amazon can also fit more packages into each delivery vehicle, leading to fewer journeys and contributing to its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.\n\"Amazon unveils new recyclable paper envelope for UK deliveries\" was originally created and published by Energy Monitor, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  HALELUYA HADERO ",
        "Text": "Amazon is challenging the structure of the National Labor Relations Board in a lawsuit that also accuses the agency of improperly influencing the outcome of a union election at a company warehouse more than two years ago.\nThe complaint, filed Thursday at a federal court in San Antonio, mirrors legal arguments the tech giant made in front of the agency earlier this year after NLRB prosecutors accused the company of maintaining policies that made it challenging for workers to organize and retaliating against some who did so.\nIn the new legal filing, attorneys for Amazon pointed back to a lawsuit the agency filed against the company in March 2022, roughly a week before voting for a union election was set to begin at a company warehouse in the New York borough of Staten Island.\nAmazon views the agency\u2019s lawsuit, which sought to force the company to give a union organizer his job back, as improperly influencing the outcome of the election. The company has also cited the action as one of its objections to the historic election, where workers voted in favor of union representation for the first time in the U.S.\nLast month, the NLRB\u2019s board denied Amazon\u2019s appeal to review its objections, closing off any options for the company to get the election results overturned within the agency.\nIn its new complaint, Amazon said the four NLRB board members who authorized the injunction were later judges reviewing the objections that came before them. It argued that structure was unconstitutional because board members are shielded from removal by the president, violates Amazon\u2019s due process rights as well as right to a jury trial.\nOther companies, such as Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and Trader Joe\u2019s, have also challenged the structure of the agency in pending lawsuits or administrative cases. Kayla Blado, spokesperson for the NLRB General Counsel noted that while big companies have sought to challenge the NLRB, the Supreme Court in 1937 upheld the agency\u2019s constitutionality.\n\u201cWhile the current challenges require the NLRB to expend scarce resources defending against them, we\u2019ve seen that the results of these kinds of challenges is ultimately a delay in justice, but that ultimately justice does prevail,\u201d Blado said.\nEarlier this year, NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, said at an event that the challenges were intended to prevent the agency from enforcing labor laws as companies \u201cdivert attention away from the fact that they're actually law-breakers.\"\nAmazon is asking the court to issue an order that stops the agency from pursuing \u201cunconstitutional\u201d administrative proceedings against the company as the case plays out.\n"

        "Author": "  Daniyal Jawaid ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Stocks To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we will look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the 10 best stocks to buy right now according to billionaire Cliff Asness.\nThe investment approach of Cliff Asness, through his multi-billion dollar hedge fund AQR Capital Management, is quite unique. While some investors such as\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0and\u00a0Seth Klarman\u00a0focus on value, and others like\u00a0Ken Fisher\u00a0focus on growth, Asness\u2019 fund tries to quantitatively define what quality is.\nWhile it sounds like a tall order, the hedge fund investor whose latest net worth is estimated to be $2 billion, has written quite a bit on the determinants of a quality stock. One such work came in the form of a research paper published in 2013. In it, Asness and his co authors shared three primary drivers of a quality stock. These are a stock\u2019s profitability, growth, and safety. Within these three factors, profitability is driven by gross profits over assets, return on equity, return on assets, cash flow over assets, gross margin, and the portion of earnings that was cash. A quality stock\u2019s growth is determined by the five year average growth in the per share values of the first five profitability factors, while a stock\u2019s safety is based on its beta, leverage, bankruptcy risk, and return on equity volatility.\nUsing these metrics, Asness built two portfolios. The first portfolio selected stocks based on the quality metrics, while the latter, called Quality Minus Junk (QMJ) goes long on the quality stocks and shorts the junk stocks. QMJ is more characteristic of AQR Capital\u2019s investment approach. The results showed that without adjusting for risk, the ten sub quality portfolios starting from a quality score of one and ending at ten all had positive excess returns over Treasury bills.\nThese\u00a0returns\u00a0ranged from 28 basis points of excess returns for the lowest quality portfolio to 70 basis points for the highest quality portfolio. The difference in the highest and lowest returns for these portfolios was the sharpest when they were tuned for the Carhart Four Factor Model that adds momentum to the traditional three factor Fama Factor model. The difference was 105 basis points per month for the four factor adjustment.\nLooking at the\u00a0returns\u00a0for the QMJ portfolio, these jump to 60 basis points for the four factor model for US stocks and 61 basis points per month for the three and four factor models for global equities. When the US and global monthly excess returns are\u00a0plotted\u00a0over time for cumulative alpha, they sit at roughly 425% for the US between 1957 and 2016 and at 200% for global stocks between 1986 and 2012.\nShifting gears, as 2023 proved to be beneficial to the stock market because of returns driven by large cap stocks and artificial intelligence, AQR Capital also posted strong results. As per Reuters, the fund\u2019s Absolute Return Strategy delivered 18.5% in returns in 2023, while the AQR Equity Market Neutral Global Value strategy returned a stronger 20.6% in net returns. Before fees, the Absolute Return\u2019s returns were 55%, with the net, or post fee returns sitting at 43.5% in 2022\u00a0according\u00a0to Bloomberg,\nAQR\u2019s double digit performance continued during the first quarter. More data sourced by Bloomberg shows that AQR\u2019s Managed Futures Full Volatility Strategy, Delphi Long Short Equity Strategy, and Apex Strategy gained 17.4%, 13%, and 11%, during Q1 2024. Insider Monkey\u2019s data shows that the cumulative value of the hedge fund\u2019s stock holdings filed with the SEC was $58.7 billion by the end of that time period marking a $13.1 billion or 28.7% annual jump. Double digit returns in a quarter are no small matter, and some of the best known hedge funds such as\u00a0Citadel Wellington,\u00a0Point72, and\u00a0Millennium\u00a05.8%, 5.3%, and 3.7% in respective returns during the same time period.\nBefore we get to our list of Cliff Asness\u2019 top stock picks, it\u2019s also important to see how his firms\u2019 funds have performed so far during the year. September has marked the start of a paradigm shift on Wall Street in the form of the Federal Reserve starting its interest rate cuts in the form of a 50 basis point cut. However, the Fed\u2019s data seems to have disappointed investors as it indicates that as of mid September, it expects the rate to sit at 3.25% \u2013 3.50% by 2025 end.\nWhen looking at the returns of AQR\u2019s different funds year to date, it appears that momentum is one of the top plays as of now. This is because the AQR Large Cap Momentum Style Fund has delivered 21.70% in year to date returns which is roughly three percentage points higher than the benchmark index\u2019s 18.64% in returns. On the flip side, the AQR Large Cap Defensive Style Fund has delivered 16.11% in year to date returns which are 2.53 percentage points lower than the benchmark\u2019s returns. Judging by this, the momentum fund which touts to invest in stocks \u201cconsidered to have positive momentum if it has performed well in the prior 12 months relative to other stocks in the investment universe\u201d has been the way to go so far in 2024.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to buy according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of his fund AQR Capital\u2019s Q2 2024 13F SEC filings and picked out the most valuable stakes.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors based on Insider Monkey\u2019s research. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 308\nAQR Funds\u2019 Latest Investment Stake: $1 billion\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American eCommerce and cloud computing company. The firm has one of the widest and most stable moats on Wall Street due to its dual business. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s eCommerce operations provide it access to a sizeable market where it leads in the market by attracting billions of users (3.25 billion in June) to its website. Its scale also allows Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to enjoy competitive advantages such as a click to door speed of 1.9 days. Additionally, the cloud computing business enables the firm to beef up its margins, which are notoriously low for the eCommerce sector. It also provides Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) exposure to the AI industry, where it is one of the leaders due to its presence in all layers of the AI stack. This ranges from designing its own chips to having access to a foundational AI model via Claude, and AI end products through AWS.\nAlbyn Capital Management mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cIn his annual letter to shareholders, CEO Andy Jassy underscores Amazon\u2019s commitment to \u201cprimitive services\u201d over the last 20 years \u2013 creating foundational building blocks that empower rapid development of higher level products and services. Examples include developing core functionalities like payments and search, which eventually led to the Fulfilled by Amazon service, or developing logistics infrastructure, which led to the Buy with Prime service. Amazon is adopting the same approach to the next front, GenAI, from custom AI chips and training/deployment services to empower companies to construct their own core GenAI models, to their Bedrock service which allows customers to use pre-existing models to more quickly develop applications, to Amazon developing their own applications for internal use (think Alexa and a new shopping AI called Rufus). Amazon\u2019s dominance comes not just from its scale but also from a relentless \u201ccustomer obsession,\u201d exemplified by its focus on building services that empower customers. This positions Amazon to capture significant shares of the growing retail and cloud markets. With a 45% share of online retail, which only makes up 25% of total retail sales, Amazon is well-placed for growth. The company\u2019s expansion into the grocery sector, backed by investments in same-day delivery, shows promise. Currently, Amazon holds a 20% share of the grocery market, a segment that constitutes 34% of US retail sales but is only 12% penetrated. As online retail trends towards 40-50% penetration, Amazon\u2019s growth potential is meaningful. Similarly, in the cloud sector, only 10% of IT spending has shifted to the cloud, with AWS holding a 35% market share.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 4th on our list. While we acknowledge AMZN's potential as an AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Chris Neiger, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "\nCostco members know better than anyone else just how much money they can save when shopping at the discount warehouse store. Recent research shows that some members can save up to $1,000 annually in groceries.\nBut is shopping at Costco always the cheapest option? Probably not. Here are a handful of items you might be able to find at a lower price on Amazon -- and one Amazon perk that could save you even more money.\nCostco and Amazon require you to be a member to access the best deals. Amazon's Prime membership will set you back $139 for a year-long membership, or $15 for a one-month memberhsip, while Costco's basic Gold Star membership costs $65 annually. Costco also offers a $130 Executive membership, which gives you additional perks, like 2% cash back on purchases.\nI'm an Amazon Prime member and, until recently, had a Costco membership, so I know that both have their strengths. But sometimes assuming that one store will have cheaper prices than another is a good way to go over budget when shopping.\nSo, I combed through both company's websites, comparing prices in a variety of categories to find a few deals where Amazon wins out. Here's what I found:\nComputer: A previous-generation (but still new) 13-inch Apple Macbook Air M2 costs $849 on Amazon right now, a $100 discount compared to Costco's online price.\nToothpaste: I found a four-pack of Colgate Optic White Platinum toothpaste on Amazon for less than $14, a $5 savings over Costco's online price.\nBatteries: Both Amazon and Costco have their own brand of batteries, but a 48-pack of AA Amazon Basics batteries costs $0.50 less than the same number of Kirkland brand batteries.\nPaper shredder: An Amazon Basics 12-sheet paper and credit card shredder costs just $59, compared to the cheapest 14-sheet paper shredder I could find on Costco's website, which was $80. Two pages fewer of shredding power is probably worth the $21 in savings.\nWhile I found these items for a cheaper price on Amazon, it's worth mentioning that Costco's in-store prices may vary. Also, Amazon's prices can fluctuate, so there's no guarantee the products I found on Amazon will continue to be cheaper than at Costco.\nIt's important to note that when I was comparison shopping, I found a lot of items on Amazon that would have been even cheaper if I added them to my Subscribe & Save list.\nSubscribe & Save is Amazon's free service that saves you money for getting certain items delivered regularly. For example, if you know you'll need batteries, laundry detergent, cereal, tissues, and dish soap every month, you can add them to your Subscribe & Save list, pick the delivery frequency, and receive a discount on your order.\nYou can save 15% or more when you add five or more items to your Subscribe & Save list, and thousands of items are available for a discount. My wife uses it all the time for everyday household products, which have the added convenience of being delivered right to our doorstep.\nI have to admit that it took me a while to find a handful of items cheaper on Amazon than at Costco. Apparently, beating the discount warehouse club's prices is no easy feat. And if you have a Costco credit card or regularly buy gas at the store, then Amazon may not be your best choice. Unless, of course, you're really looking for a sweet deal on a paper shredder.\nWe love versatile credit cards that offer huge rewards everywhere, including Costco!\u00a0This card is a standout among America's favorite credit cards because it offers perhaps the easiest $200 cash bonus you could ever earn and an unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases, even when you shop at Costco. Add on the competitive 0% interest period and it's no wonder we awarded this card Best No Annual Fee Credit Card.\nClick here to read our full review for free\u00a0and apply before the $200 welcome bonus offer ends!\nWe're firm believers in the Golden Rule, which is why editorial opinions are ours alone and have not been previously reviewed, approved, or endorsed by included advertisers.

        "Title": "Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Best Performing Dow Stock in 2024?",
        "Author": "  Umar Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Performing Dow Stocks in 2024. In this article, we will look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks on our list of the best-performing Dow stocks in 2024.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is one of the most closely watched stock indices globally, often considered a barometer of the overall health and trajectory of the American economy. As a price-weighted index, it is composed of 30 blue-chip companies from various sectors, excluding transportation and utilities. The Dow\u2019s inclusion of companies from diverse industries such as technology, healthcare, finance, and consumer goods makes it a valuable indicator of market trends. Created in 1896 by Charles Dow, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has stood the test of time and, alongside the NASDAQ 100 and the S&P 500, remains one of the most recognized and influential stock market indices in the world.\nThe Dow\u2019s journey over the past century has been marked by numerous highs and lows, often reflecting the broader economic conditions. For instance, the index experienced some of its worst single-day losses during the 2008 financial crisis. On September 29, 2008, the Dow plunged by 777.68 points, which was its largest single-day point drop at the time. The financial crisis, triggered by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and a series of banking failures, led to panic selling across global markets. That year, the Dow lost nearly 34% of its value, marking one of its worst annual performances. On the flip side, some of the best years in the Dow\u2019s history include 1915, when it rose by a staggering 81.66%, and 1933, when it registered an annual gain of 63.74% amid a recovery from the Great Depression.\nFast forward to 2024, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has continued its volatile yet upward trajectory. As of September 20, 2024, the Dow closed at a new record high of 42,063.36 points, inching up by 38.17 points or 0.09% for the day. This milestone was reached after a period of substantial gains following the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to ease interest rates\u2014the first such move in four years. The easing of monetary policy has provided a boost to the market, with investor sentiment improving and confidence in the resilience of the American economy strengthening.\nDespite some mid-week volatility in the broader market, the Dow is expected to end September on a positive note. This rally was notable, considering the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, which has led many investors to take a cautious stance and refrain from making significant commitments until the political landscape becomes clearer. Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, highlighted this hesitancy during an appearance on CNBC\u2019s \u201cClosing Bell,\u201d noting that \u201ca lot of investors don\u2019t want to commit capital until after Election Day. I don\u2019t think it matters who wins; they just want to get that event behind them.\u201d\nDespite these uncertainties, the Dow has shown remarkable resilience, tracking to end the month of September higher. The 30-stock index has hit several fresh all-time highs throughout the year, demonstrating robust performance across key sectors. In fact, as of September 25, 2024, the Dow had reached a 52-week high of 42,299.64 points, representing a year-to-date (YTD) gain of 11.21% and a one-year change of 23.25%. These figures underscore the strength of the index and the performance of its constituent companies.\nThe success of the Dow in 2024 can be attributed to a range of factors. For one, leading technology and consumer goods companies, which form a significant part of the index, have continued to post strong earnings amid solid consumer demand and operational efficiencies. Moreover, the financial sector has also benefitted from the recent shifts in monetary policy, with lower interest rates driving increased borrowing and investment activities. Additionally, healthcare companies have maintained growth trajectories, as innovation and demand for services remain high in the post-pandemic era.\nThe top-performing stocks within the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2024 have played a pivotal role in driving the index to record highs. These companies, known for their strong fundamentals, market leadership, and robust financial health, have outpaced broader market expectations. Investors seeking exposure to blue-chip companies with a track record of stability and consistent returns have found the Dow to be an attractive option.\nIn this article, we will delve into the 10 best-performing Dow stocks in 2024. From established technology giants to consumer staples that continue to dominate their respective industries, these stocks have led the charge in pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average to new heights.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we utilized a stock screener to identify DJIA index stocks that have shown significant gains year-to-date as of September 25, 2024. We arranged these stocks in ascending order based on their performance. Additionally, we examined the hedge fund sentiment surrounding these stocks, noting the number of hedge fund holders for each as of the end of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nYear to date Share Price Gain: 26.71%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) demonstrated exceptional financial performance in Q2 2024, significantly exceeding market expectations with an earnings per share (EPS) of $1.26 compared to forecasts of $1.03. The company reported revenues of $148 billion, marking an 11% year-over-year increase, and a remarkable operating income of $14.7 billion, up 91% year-over-year. These robust results reflect Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ability to navigate economic challenges and leverage growth opportunities effectively.\nOne of the standout highlights from the earnings release was the dramatic increase in free cash flow, which surged 664% to $51.4 billion over the trailing twelve months. This metric underscores Amazon\u2019s operational efficiency and cash-generating capabilities, allowing for strategic reinvestment in core areas such as AWS and AI-driven services. The AWS segment showcased continued strength, with revenue growth accelerating from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by trends in cloud migration and increasing demand for AI capabilities.\nFurthermore, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising business is on an upward trajectory, generating over $50 billion in revenue in the last year. The ongoing improvements in ad technology and the integration of AI in ad services present significant growth prospects, indicating that Amazon is well-positioned to capitalize on this market.\nThe company\u2019s strategic investments in generative AI and machine learning are also promising. The introduction of products like Amazon SageMaker and Bedrock positions Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a leader in the cloud computing landscape, catering to a growing number of developers and businesses eager to leverage AI technologies.\nInvestor sentiment remains strong, evidenced by a year-to-date share price gain of 26.71% and an increase in hedge fund holders, which rose to 308 as of Q2 2024, up from 302 in the previous quarter. These factors collectively create a compelling investment narrative for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), making it a standout performer in the Dow, particularly as it continues to innovate and expand its market presence across diverse sectors.\nOverall AMZN ranks 7th on our list of the best-performing Dow stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of\u00a0 AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Prediction: Amazon Will NOT Become the Market's Next Dividend Stock, and This Is Why",
        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The fact that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is still not a dividend stock may come as a surprise to some investors. It is one of the world's largest publicly traded companies and boasts one of the most stable balance sheets around.\nAfter years of not returning cash to shareholders, even tech giants such as Google parent Alphabet and Meta Platforms\u00a0initiated payouts in 2024. Still, despite the pressure Alphabet's and Meta's examples might place on Amazon, it is unlikely to follow suit. Here's why.\nAt first glance, the lack of a dividend may seem surprising. Amazon's market cap is about $2 trillion. This makes it the fourth-biggest publicly traded company measured by market cap, and the largest to not return cash to shareholders.\nMoreover, investors tend to view dividends as a sign of a company's strength and stability, as one must sustain relatively steady positive cash flows to maintain a payout. From a cash standpoint, Amazon's balance sheet indicates it could support a significant dividend. As of the end of the second quarter of 2024, Amazon held $89 billion in liquidity. The company also generated $53 billion in free cash flow during the past 12 months.\nFree cash flow is what's left after the company invests in capital improvements. Hence, even when considering Amazon's $55 billion in long-term debt, there's little Amazon cannot afford to do, including paying a dividend.\nDespite its high degree of financial flexibility, Amazon's shareholders should not expect it to follow in the footsteps of Alphabet and Meta by offering a dividend. The likely reason is Amazon's apparent belief that it can deploy cash better than its shareholders.\nOne surprising indicator that shows its low likelihood of a dividend payment is the company's share count. Amazon shares outstanding number about 10.5 billion, and despite considerable liquidity, that count has risen by 6% during the past five years.\nThat pace of share growth is unlikely to undermine its shareholders. Still, the apparent need to dilute shareholders at all is perplexing, given Amazon's liquidity.\nAmazon's share repurchase program may only add to this confusion. The company authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program in March 2022. However, as of mid-2024, it had spent only $3.9 billion of that on buybacks, meaning that it remains a net issuer of shares.\nStill, in fairness to Amazon, not every mega-cap company believes in dividends. The most prominent opponent of dividend payments is arguably Warren Buffett. Besides a brief experiment with dividends in 1967, Berkshire Hathaway has not offered payouts.\nNonetheless, unlike Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway is a huge proponent of share repurchases and has periodically bought back A shares in the first half of 2024 and earlier. Since Amazon has not commented on this issue extensively, one has to assume it shares Buffett's philosophy on how to use excess cash.\nAlthough it looks like Amazon should pay dividends, investors should not consider such a move likely.\nDespite achieving a high level of financial stability, Amazon continues to partially fund its expansion plans by issuing shares. It has also chosen not to take full advantage of its share repurchase program, meaning the number of shares outstanding continues to rise.\nThus, until Amazon's management changes its dividend philosophy, investors who want cash from owning Amazon will probably have to sell shares.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Affan Mir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best 5G Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other 5G stocks.\n5G, or fifth-generation wireless technology, is the latest evolution in mobile networks, which is designed to significantly improve speed, reduce latency, and enhance the capacity and connectivity of mobile devices. A Market Research Future report estimates that in 2024, the 5G market is projected to be worth $15.03 billion, and by 2032, it could reach $229.41 billion. This rapid increase represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.60% during the forecast period. According to some experts, 5G is one of the most important trends in technology along with artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn a CNBC interview at the Mobile World Congress Shanghai on June 26, director-general of the GSM Association, Mats Granryd highlighted the deep connection between 5G and AI and suggested that their mutual rise is not accidental. He said that \u201cAI feeds off 5G and 5G feeds off AI.\u201d\u00a0 This is especially evident in China, where the development of standalone 5G networks is well advanced and discussions are already shifting toward 5G Advanced (5.5G). While some countries lag, like the Philippines, Mats pointed out that this dynamic between 5G and AI is most prominent in regions with widespread 5G coverage.\nWhen asked about the rivalry between countries like the U.S. and China in AI and 5G, Mats said that such competition is insignificant. He said that from his experience on the GSMA board, which represents the 25 largest mobile operators globally, the focus is on creating common standards and specifications rather than competing.\nHe talked about the difficulties of the 2G and 3G eras when different technologies created challenges for global connectivity. The shift to a unified 4G standard was a pivotal moment that laid the foundation for the digital economy.\nMats believes that 5G will follow a similar path to become a common platform worldwide, which will also extend to AI. While some regions may advance faster than others initially, he showed confidence in the fact that everyone will eventually catch up and benefit from the integration of AI with 5G.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used stock screeners and ETFs to identify companies involved in the 5G market. We then selected 10 stocks with the smallest short interest and listed them in descending order of their short interest. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 elite hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company known for its various offerings in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and AI. While it is widely recognized for its e-commerce platform and Prime membership, it has also made advancements in the 5G technology sector through its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is one of the best 5G stocks to buy according to short sellers.\nAWS provides a variety of solutions tailored for the development and management of 5G networks, including AWS Private 5G, Edge Computing for 5G, and AWS 5G Core Network Solutions. AWS Private 5G is a managed service designed to assist businesses in setting up, managing, and expanding their own private 5G networks on their premises.\nIn addition, AWS partners with telecom operators such as Verizon to aid in their 5G deployments. AWS also offers edge computing solutions, including AWS Outposts, which enable telecom providers to deliver computational power directly to businesses.\nIn the second quarter, 308 hedge funds had stakes in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), with total positions worth $65.8 billion. As of June 30,\u00a0Fisher Asset Management\u00a0is the most significant shareholder in the company with a stake worth $8.46 billion.\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing need for cloud computing and data infrastructure, which are crucial for the expansion of 5G networks. As the adoption of 5G technology progresses, there is a rising demand for innovative cloud services and enhanced data processing capabilities, making AWS a key player in this space.\nAccording to a media brand, CRN, AWS has a dominant position in the global cloud market, where it had a 31% share in the first quarter. This leadership is supported by the company\u2019s extensive investment in product development, including custom AI chips and advanced software, which supports its growing role in AI cloud services.\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) saw its total sales rise by 10% to $148 billion in the second quarter, with projections for the third quarter indicating a growth rate of 8% to 11%. AWS contributed $9.3 billion in operating income for the quarter, accounting for 63% of the company\u2019s total operating income. CEO Andy Jassy highlighted that over the past 18 months, AWS has introduced more machine learning and generative AI features than all other major cloud providers combined. Furthermore, the company plans to invest nearly $150 billion in data centers over the next 15 years as it anticipates a surge in demand for AI cloud services.\nDiamond Hill Capital\u00a0stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc.

        "Text": "- A patient with ALS in the United States is the first person in the world to use Amazon Alexa via an implantable brain computer interface to interact with and control his environment.\nNEW YORK, September 16, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Synchron, the brain-computer interface (BCI) company, today announced the first use of Amazon\u2019s Alexa by one of the patients implanted with the Synchron brain computer interface.\nMark, a 64-year old man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), successfully used his direct thoughts to control his smart home via the Tap to Alexa feature on his Amazon Fire tablet. This capability allows Mark to utilize the Synchron brain computer interface to select customized tiles that perform pre-set Alexa actions, like turning on and off lights, making video calls, playing music and shows, controlling smart home devices, reading books on Kindle or purchasing items on Amazon\u2014entirely hands and voice-free.\n\"The integration with smart technology and my BCI is something I'm really excited about.

Typically, the \"smartest\" AI applications are powered by the LLMs with the most data, and the training process is facilitated by centralized data centers filled with graphics processing units (GPUs).\nNvidia supplies the world's most powerful GPUs for developing AI models. Simply put, the more GPUs a developer can access, the more data they can feed into an LLM, and the faster it can be processed. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Supercluster technology allows developers to scale up to more than 32,000 Nvidia GPUs (and soon, over 65,000), which is more than any other data center provider.\nPlus, the company's random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology moves data from one point to another more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks. Since developers often pay for computing capacity by the minute, OCI is among the fastest and cheapest solutions for training LLMs. That's why AI leaders like OpenAI, Cohere, and Elon Musk's xAI are now using Oracle.\nOracle chairman Larry Ellison says the company currently has 85 live data centers, with 77 under construction. However, he estimates the company will eventually have somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000, so it has barely scratched the surface of its opportunity so far.\nAutomation is one thing that sets Oracle apart from other data center operators. No matter its size, every Oracle data center is identical in terms of functionality, so the company is able to manage them all with software alone -- no humans required. Not only is that a big cost savings for the end-user, but it also creates a more secure service by eliminating human error. Plus, automation is the key to scaling up Oracle's data center locations into the thousands.\nOracle generated $13.3 billion in total revenue during the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended Aug. 31), a 7% increase from the year-ago period. The OCI segment, specifically, delivered $2.2 billion in revenue, up by a whopping 46%.\nAs in previous quarters, OCI revenue would have grown even faster during Q1 if the company had more data centers online. It currently has an enormous backlog of customers waiting for more computing capacity.\nThat is reflected in Oracle's remaining performance obligations, which came in at a record $99 billion during the quarter, up 52% year over year. That was an acceleration from the 44% growth the company achieved in the final quarter of fiscal 2024. Oracle signed 42 new deals for GPU capacity worth $3 billion during Q1 alone, contributing to the sharp increase in remaining performance obligations (RPOs).\nCEO Safra Catz believes 38% of the company's RPOs (around $37.6 billion) will be converted to revenue over the next 12 months, which should help the company return to double-digit percentage growth at the top line. Additionally, she expects an acceleration in OCI growth compared to the previous fiscal year.\nOracle has generated $3.88 in trailing-12-month earnings per share. So, based on its current stock price of $155.89, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40.2. The Nasdaq-100 technology index trades at a P/E ratio of 30.7, so Oracle stock certainly isn't cheap when measured against its peers.\nHowever, Oracle's trailing-12-month earnings grew by 15% compared to the prior period, and Wall Street is forecasting accelerated earnings growth of 24% for fiscal 2025 overall. That might explain why investors are now willing to pay a premium for its stock.\nMathematically speaking, if Oracle's P/E ratio remains constant, the company could achieve a $1 trillion valuation within the next 10 years, even if its earnings growth slows to just 8.8%. But that's a very conservative estimate considering based on Ellison's comments, it could grow its data center footprint tenfold over the long term. If that happens, Oracle's earnings growth is likely to accelerate, not decelerate, in the coming decade.\nRemember, the company's data centers rely on automation, so they offer incredible scalability. In other words, Oracle should experience an expanding gross profit margin as more data centers are built, which will be a huge tailwind for its earnings.\nAs a result, I think Oracle has a great opportunity to join its big-tech peers in the $1 trillion club within the next decade.\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Nvidia Stock Investors Just Got a Grim Warning From Apple and Amazon",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. In fact, analysts estimate its graphics processing units account for up to 95% of AI chip sales. But history is full of cautionary tales about the downfall of dominant brands that failed to maintain their technological leadership.\nIBM was once a highly esteemed computing company due to its mainframes and storage solutions, but it failed to innovate around cloud computing and PCs. Cisco was briefly the most valuable company in the world, back when the internet buildout drove demand for its networking products, but it no longer ranks among the top 50 because it failed to innovate.\nThose are just two examples from a long list that includes AOL, BlackBerry, Blockbuster, Kodak, and MySpace. To be clear, Nvidia is in no immediate danger of joining that list, but history says shareholders would be foolish to dismiss the idea completely. Indeed, recent warnings from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) make it clear that Nvidia is not immune to competition.\nHere are the important details.\nEarlier this year, Apple announced a set of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities for iOS and macOS devices called Apple Intelligence. Features include drafting and revising text, generating images, and summarizing notifications, as well as a more capable version of the personal assistant Siri. Apple Intelligence will launch in late October.\nIn July, Apple published a technical paper stating, \"Apple Intelligence consists of multiple highly capable generative models that are fast, efficient, specialized for our users' everyday tasks, and can adapt on the fly for their current activity.\" The paper also detailed how two of those models -- one that runs on devices for simple tasks, and another that runs in private data centers for more sophisticated tasks -- were trained.\nImportantly, Apple did not use Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) to develop its large language models. It used custom silicon called tensor processing units (TPUs) designed by Alphabet's Google and Broadcom. Notably, Broadcom is also helping other companies design custom AI chips, including Meta Platforms, OpenAI, and ByteDance, according to JPMorgan Chase.\nHere's the bottom line: Apple's decision to use TPUs rather than GPUs to train its AI models is a warning that viable alternatives to Nvidia exist. The relative importance of that decision is yet to be determined. If Apple Intelligence is glitchy, it may turn into a cautionary tale about what happens when companies stray from the industry standard. But if Apple Intelligence is well received by consumers, Apple's decision to use TPUs may inspire other companies to do the same.\nAlphabet's Google is not the only public cloud to develop custom AI silicon. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has done the same thing. Its custom chips -- Trainium for AI training and Inferentia for AI inference -- are not designed to outshine Nvidia GPUs on performance alone, but rather to give customers a more cost effective alternative.\nAlphabet and Amazon have deep partnerships with Nvidia. Both companies offer compute instances powered by Nvidia GPUs and that will not change anytime soon. Nvidia GPUs are the gold standard in data center accelerators, so it would be nonsensical to not offer that option. However, both companies have seen fit to develop their own chips on the side.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy recently said:\n\"We've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. And the second versions of those chips, with Trainium coming later this year, are very compelling on price performance. We are seeing significant demand for these chips.\"\nHere's the bottom line: Some companies will gladly pay a premium for Nvidia GPUs, but demand for AWS's custom silicon shows that other companies will gladly use slower chips to save money. In other words, AWS (like Apple) is warning investors that Nvidia will almost certainly lose market share in the future, which could pressure the company's margins as it fights to compete with cheaper alternatives.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Daniel Wiessner ",
        "Text": "By Daniel Wiessner\n(Reuters) -Amazon.com sued a U.S. labor board on Thursday, accusing it of illegally interfering in a union election at a New York City warehouse and claiming the agency's structure violates the U.S. Constitution.\nThe lawsuit filed in San Antonio, Texas, federal court seeks to block the National Labor Relations Board from deciding a case that could force Amazon to bargain with the union, which won a 2022 election at the warehouse in Staten Island.\nThe labor board last week upheld the results of the election, rejecting Amazon's claims that it was tainted by demonstrations held by workers and union organizers and that board officials who oversaw the voting were biased toward the union.\nAmazon's lawsuit says the board's in-house enforcement proceedings violate the constitutional separation of powers and the company's right to a jury trial.\nNearly 20 other companies including rocket maker SpaceX, Starbucks and Trader Joe's have made similar claims against the board in pending lawsuits and administrative cases.\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An NLRB spokeswoman declined to comment.\nThe election at the Amazon warehouse known as JFK8 was the first and so far only successful union campaign in the company's history.\nWorkers at two other Amazon warehouses in New York and one in Alabama have since voted against joining the Amazon Labor Union, which recently affiliated itself with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\nThe NLRB issued scores of complaints accusing Amazon of illegal union-busting tactics during those campaigns, including firing union supporters, making threats, holding mandatory anti-union meetings, and refusing to bargain with the Staten Island union. Amazon has denied wrongdoing.\nThat included a rare lawsuit the board filed in New York federal court on the eve of the Staten Island election accusing Amazon of illegally firing a pro-union worker. In Thursday's lawsuit, Amazon claims that the labor board \"interfered with the free and fair choice of the employee voters\" by suing the company.\nAmazon's lawsuit also alleges that the NLRB's five members, who are appointed by the president, are improperly shielded from being removed at will, and that the board's unique structure where it serves as a prosecutor, judge, and jury in certain cases violates the U.S. Constitution.\nNLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden, has said the claims about the board's structure lack merit and that companies challenging the agency are attempting to distract from their violations of workers' labor rights.\nIn July, two federal judges in Texas issued separate rulings temporarily blocking NLRB cases against SpaceX and pipeline operator Energy Transfer. The judges said the companies were likely to prevail on claims that board members and administrative judges are improperly insulated from removal.\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Richard Chang, Alexia Garamfalvi and Diane Craft)\n"

        "Author": "  FABIANO MAISONNAVE ",
        "Text": "BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) \u2014 A judge in the Brazilian state of Rondonia has found two beef slaughterhouses guilty of buying cattle from a protected area of former rainforest in the Amazon and ordered them, along with three cattle ranchers, to pay a total of $764,000 for causing environmental damage, according to the decision issued Wednesday. Cattle raising drives Amazon deforestation. The companies Distriboi and Frigon and the ranchers may appeal.\nIt is the first decision in several dozen lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in environmental damages from the slaughterhouses for allegedly trading in cattle raised illegally in a protected area known as Jaci-Parana, which was rainforest but is now mostly converted to pasture.\nFour slaughterhouses are among the many parties charged, including JBS SA, which bills itself as the world\u2019s largest protein producer. The court has not decided on the cases involving JBS.\nBrazilian law forbids commercial cattle inside a protected area, yet some 210,000 head are being grazed inside Jaci-Parana, according to the state animal division. With almost 80% of its forest destroyed, it ranks as the most ravaged conservation unit in the Brazilian Amazon. A court filing pegs damages in the reserve at some $1 billion.\nThe lawsuits are based on transfer documents first reported by the Associated Press that show cattle going directly from protected areas to slaughterhouses. The documents were filled out by the illegal ranchers themselves.\nPart of the decision is a collective penalty of $453,000 against the five defendants, who are linked to one farm. The money will be used to reforest 232 hectares (573 acres) of what is now pasture there.\n\u201cWhen a slaughterhouse, whether by negligence or intent, buys and resells products from invaded and illegally deforested reserves, it is clear that it is directly benefiting from these illegal activities,\u201d according to a part of the original complaint which Judge In\u00eas Moreira da Costa sustained in her ruling. \u201cIn such cases, there is an undeniable connection between the company\u2019s actions and the environmental damage caused by the illegal exploitation.\u201d\nFrigon and Distriboi did not respond to questions sent by email. In a filing, Frigon argued the state of Rondonia allowed ranchers to sell the cattle and said there is no relation between buying beef cattle and deforestation. In filings, Distriboi also denies any wrongdoing.\nJBS also did not reply to a request for comment.\nRondonia, on the border with Bolivia, is the most badly deforested state in the Brazilian Amazon. In the past few weeks, most cities have been covered by thick smoke from wildfires, a sign of rampant deforestation. The situation is so dire that its main airport in Porto Velho was closed for seven consecutive days.\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Each model of this family is designed for various use cases. With Gemini, Google offers the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to date.\nThe company offers an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool, Gemini Code Assist, which is driving its momentum among various enterprises.\nSolid momentum in Google\u2019s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is another positive. The launch of the latest image generation model, namely Imagen 3, in preview for Vertex AI customers with early access, is a plus.\nGoogle\u2019s introduction of various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure is another positive.\nGoogle offers Gemma 2, which belongs to its family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models called Gemma, to researchers and developers across the globe. It is available in both 9 billion (9B) and 27 billion (27B) parameter sizes.\nIts unveiling of LearnLM, a family of GenAI models designed for conversational tutoring on various subjects, is noteworthy.\nGoogle\u2019s continued efforts toward innovation in AI techniques for the advancement of its search segment, which accounts for a major portion of its total revenues, are driving traffic on its search platform.\nThe integration of GenAI technology into the search engine is benefiting Google Search. LLMs, coupled with multi-search and visual exploration features, are continuously improving the search results.\nThe introduction of Search Generative Experience (\u201cSGE\u201d), which leverages GenAI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, is noteworthy.\nThe company\u2019s strength in the mobile search category on the back of mobile-friendly algorithms, robust product listings and flight search capabilities is a plus.\nComing to the advertisement business, Alphabet\u2019s growing efforts to deliver better performance and profitability to advertisers on the back of foundational research models and LLMs are major positives.\nSGE is aiding the performance of GOOGL\u2019s advertisement business by helping in the creation of relevant, customized and high-quality ads. The strength in the conversational experience of Google Ads and Performance Max is driving the company\u2019s momentum among advertisers. The improving performance of YouTube ads is another positive.\nThis apart, the strengthening user momentum in YouTube Shorts is a tailwind. Google\u2019s growing efforts to bolster relationships with content creators are positive.\nAlphabet is well-poised to penetrate the booming autonomous driving space rapidly on the back of its strong efforts toward reaching out to more customers on the back of its robust driverless technology and expansion efforts.\nWaymo\u2019s strong operations in Phoenix, AZ, are a major positive.\nThe company\u2019s multi-year partnership with Uber Technologies to offer an autonomous driving experience to the latter\u2019s customers in Phoenix, AZ, is noteworthy. This deal is in sync with the company\u2019s deepening focus in Phoenix.\nThe company also rolled out a rider-only service in downtown Phoenix.\nApart from Phoenix, Alphabet made Waymo One available to everyone in San Francisco. This move marks Waymo\u2019s very first such expansion outside of Phoenix.\nWaymo received regulatory approval to expand in Los Angeles. It is also testing its self-driving vehicles on the streets of Bellevue, WA.\nAdditionally, the company is testing self-driving vehicles on the streets of Austin, TX, which was declared the fourth city for Waymo One last year.\nWaymo recently expanded its partnership with Uber to introduce the Waymo One experience in Austin and Atlanta via the Uber app. The service will begin in the early 2025.\nAlphabet\u2019s long-term prospects are expected to benefit from its growing GenAI innovations and product integrations. The company\u2019s strength in search and YouTube, which are driving its advertisement revenues, is a positive. Also, its growing momentum in Waymo is a plus. All these factors are expected to drive its top-line growth in the long run.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $292.3 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 14%.\nThe same for 2024 earnings stands at $7.63 per share, which implies year-over-year growth of 31.6%. The EPS estimate has moved north by a penny over the past 60 days.\nIn this data-driven world, wherein AI has become mainstream for most businesses, Alphabet\u2019s growing GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. Moreover, the company\u2019s dominant position in the search engine market and first-mover advantage in the autonomous driving space are major positives.\nHowever, growing litigation issues related to privacy concerns and AI technology, along with intensifying competition in both AI and autonomous driving fields, do not bode well for the stock.\nAlphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

        "Text": "Mastercard and Amazon Payment Services have signed a multi-year commercial partnership agreement to digitise payment acceptance in Middle East and Africa, across countries including Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, South Africa and UAE.\nAs part of the collaboration, the payment service provider (PSP) will adopt Mastercard Gateway, a single touchpoint for payment processing, as a payment solution available in 40 markets in the region.\nThe integration of the solution will enable merchants to offer fast, seamless and secure transactions as well as convenient payment choices to customers.\nIn addition, it will open new opportunities for building synergies with entities such as telcos and governments to enhance their checkout options, driving a faster and more secure transaction rate for their customers.\nAccording to the Mastercard Payment Industry Insights Index, 95% of consumers in Middle East and Africa are considering using emerging payment methods, such as wearables, biometrics, digital wallets, QR codes, and contactless payments. Additionally, 61% of consumers would avoid businesses that do not accept electronic payments, while banks in the region that have migrated to digital channels have also seen the share of digital transactions increase from 70% to 90% over the course of approximately two years.\nAmnah Ajmal, Executive Vice President, Market Development, EEMEA, Mastercard, said: \u201cWe are proud to partner with Amazon Payment Services to scale payment acceptance and accelerate digitisation of payments with innovation solutions.\u201d\nPeter George, Managing Director, Amazon Payment Services, Middle East & North Africa, commented: \u201cWe are delighted to strengthen our collaboration with Mastercard, to deliver on our common goal of shaping the future of online payments in the region.

        "Author": "  Rob Creenan, Niagara Gazette, Niagara Falls, N.Y. ",
        "Text": "Sep. 18\u2014TOWN OF NIAGARA \u2014 Construction cranes have been set up at 8995 Lockport Road for the better part of the year, with workers so far completing 20% of Amazon's newest $550 million investment into Western New York.\nWork started this past spring on the 3.1 million-square-foot fulfillment center on 216 acres Amazon bought this past August. The metal frame at one end of the five-story building is in place, with the building's completion projected for 2026.\n\"I think we all feel the energy and are excited about the possibility of what is on the horizon,\" said Glendowlyn Thames, head of Amazon's economic development for New York state, during a media event at the construction site Wednesday.\nThe 1,000 employees at this Amazon Robotics Sortable fulfillment center will work with robotic technology to receive, store, and ship items that customers purchase, with enough room for 414 trailer parking stalls, 55 loading docks, and 1,755 parking spaces. This will be the fourth such facility in New York state, after Rochester, Syracuse, and Staten Island.\nThis \"first mile\" center is part of the first stage of the shipping process. Other smaller Amazon facilities across Western New York, in Lancaster, Tonawanda, and Hamburg, represent the \"middle mile\" and \"last mile\" where goods are shipped and received for customer delivery.\n\"If you are ordering something off of Amazon, more than likely it's starting and coming from a facility like this one,\" Thames said.\nHiring would start six months before the center's opening in 2026, with a workforce staffing team. Thames said they are focused on mainly hiring Niagara County workers, but they would not be surprised if Erie County residents apply as well.\nShe also touted that Amazon had invested $41.5 billion into New York state since 2010, adding 47,000 jobs to the state economy. The e-commerce giant has 10 fulfillment and sortation centers and 36 delivery stations across the state, along with 30 Whole Foods and five Amazon Go locations.\nNiagara County Legislator Richard Andres, the economic development committee chairman, urged his county partners to be aggressive when he heard Amazon was looking for a site after its Grand Island plans fell through.\n\"We know these jobs are important and we don't want to screw it up,\" he said. \"We're all working together and it's going to be a rising tide that lifts all boats.\"\nIn August of 2022, the Niagara County Industrial Development Agency supported giving the project nearly $124 million in total tax incentives. According to the non-profit watchdog organization Good Jobs First, one of many organizations criticizing the NCIDA for giving these tax breaks, this is the 9th largest subsidy Amazon received as of this month.\nIts Amazon tracker lists 367 nationwide subsidy awards worth a total of $5.82 billion. NCIDA chairman Mark Onesi previously said the agency has the ability to take back any incentives offered if Amazon does not live up to its job creation goals.\nDuring the planning process, local residents have complained about the subsidies, the potential traffic problems the center would cause, and that the majority of jobs offered would pay $15 an hour.\n\"Many things can change, including the wages,\" said Niagara Town Supervisor Sylvia Virtuso, acknowledging it will be challenging to find 1,000 workers. \"We're all in discussion about that. We know what it takes to employ the people, and I know Amazon does too.\"\nShe added that construction crews have accommodated resident complaints in every way possible, with berms and a separate truck entrance added. Two temporary traffic lights have been set up, with the county planning further improvements for Lockport and Packard roads and a new bus route in the works to further accommodate the facility.\n"

        "Title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Amazon",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Investors have lots of choices when picking what stocks to buy. Even among some of the most valuable companies out there, worthwhile opportunities might be available.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), for example, have produced monster returns during the past couple of decades. But which of these behemoth \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks is the better buy right now?\nThanks to its lineup of popular products, Apple has become one of the world's most recognizable brands. This brand moat has supported the company's impressive financial success over the years. According to Interbrand, Apple's brand is estimated to be worth $503 billion, more than any other business on Earth.\nWhat makes Apple special is that it has created a business model that successfully combines its hardware and software offerings. This so-called ecosystem gives the business a durable competitive advantage. The result is strong customer loyalty. Once consumers get familiar with using Apple's offerings, they are less likely to leave.\nConsequently, this means the company has historically benefited from pricing power. Its smartphones, tablets, and laptops carry premium price tags. But they are met with robust demand when each new iteration is released.\nApple is also incredibly profitable, which is another reason to appreciate the company. In the past five years, the business has posted an average gross margin of 42% and an average operating margin of 29%. This leads to lots of free cash flow -- to the tune of $100 billion in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2023.\nManagement hasn't been shy about returning this capital to shareholders. During the past nine months, the business paid $11 billion in dividends and repurchased $70 billion of its stock. This favorable capital-return program is a staple of the Apple investment thesis.\nOne undeniable reason to buy Amazon shares is because the business benefits from multiple secular tailwinds. It's the dominant leader in e-commerce, as 38% of all online spending in the U.S. goes through Amazon.com. Plus, Amazon has its hands in cloud computing with Amazon Web Services (AWS), streaming with Prime Video, and digital advertising. These trends should continue to propel the business in the years ahead.\nHistorically, investors have criticized Amazon for not prioritizing profitability. But management has been making major improvements, slashing costs, and focusing on driving greater efficiencies. In the second quarter, Amazon reported operating income of $14.7 billion. That figure was up an impressive 91% versus the same period a year ago.\nI mentioned Amazon Web Services before. This is a key growth and profit engine that gets a lot of attention. Revenue was up 19% in the last quarter, with an operating margin of more than 35%.\nAWS also positions the company to be a leader in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. AWS looks to be an important infrastructure-service provider for businesses that want to develop their own AI capabilities, with offerings like data computing and storage, as well as machine learning.\nDespite the size of the business, analysts anticipate considerable growth. According to the average of Wall Street analyst estimates, Amazon is projected to increase revenue and earnings per share (EPS) at yearly rates of 10.7% and 36.4%, respectively, between 2023 and 2026.\nBoth Apple and Amazon are fantastic businesses, a statement most investors will not argue with. However, there's one important factor to consider before picking a winner.\nInvestors need to look at valuation as part of their decision-making process. As of this writing, Apple shares trade at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 9.1. That represents a sizable 32% premium to its trailing-five-year average.\nOn the other hand, Amazon trades at a P/S of 3.4. This is in line with its five-year history. Therefore, I believe that Amazon is the better stock to buy right now. If we look out over the next three-to-five years, Amazon's return potential is higher than Apple's seems to be.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-09-30, Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $102.83. It's currently trading at a price of $187.97. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -82.8%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$4.26\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.78%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n26.16\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n12.22\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n102.83\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $62.77. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -199.46%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $62.77. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -184.37%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.
