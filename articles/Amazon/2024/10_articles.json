        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "The NASDAQ index has risen 24% year-to-date and is hovering near record highs following a summer lull. Once again, the rally has been powered largely by the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 \u2013 a select group of mega-cap tech stocks that have soared to stratospheric valuations in recent years.\nThis group includes the six largest stocks trading on Wall Street \u2013 Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta \u2013 as well as Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla. Together, these companies have been leaders in innovation, especially of the AI tech that is so rapidly changing the tech world.\nPivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak has been closely examining the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 and is now offering fresh recommendations on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Let\u2019s take a closer look at what makes these two stand out and why they are receiving Wlodarczak\u2019s endorsement.\nAmazon\nWe\u2019ll start with Amazon, the global leader in online retail. This company is a proven survivor, an original \u2018dot.com\u2019 that survived the tech bubble of the late 90s\u2013early 2000s and has grown to become one of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded firms. While the company started out as an online bookseller, today e-shoppers can find virtually anything on Amazon \u2013 and the company will guarantee delivery almost anywhere in the world.\nAmazon backs up its huge inventory, covering everything from books and toys to pharmaceuticals, clothing, and phone cases, with a network of high-tech warehouses and logistics facilities. The company\u2019s warehouses use AI and robotic tech, backed up by a human workforce, to pack and ship anything to anywhere.\nThis combination of huge inventory and fast delivery has made Amazon the world leader in e-commerce \u2013 and allowed the company to build up an enormous market cap of nearly $2 trillion, making Amazon the world\u2019s fifth-largest public company. Amazon has used its deep pockets to expand its customer base by expanding its product and service offerings.\nOn the product side, Amazon has recently been pushing its \u2018digital pharmacy\u2019 business, allowing customers to fill prescriptions online, with fully accredited pharmacists. Earlier this month, the company announced that it will be opening 20 new pharmacies, doubling the number of cities with same-day delivery service available.\nOn the service side, the company\u2019s cloud computing platform, AWS, has become increasingly popular. AWS, which is a direct competitor to Google Cloud and Microsoft\u2019s Azure, has become an important revenue driver for Amazon \u2013 and accounted for $26.3 billion of the company\u2019s $148 billion topline in Q2 of this year (the last quarter reported). That makes AWS responsible for almost 18% of the total revenue in a quarter that saw 10% year-over-year revenue growth. Amazon has been consistently reporting year-over-year quarterly revenue growth in the low double digits recently and is expected to do so again in the upcoming Q3 report. The top line for the third quarter is expected to exceed $157 billion, which would translate to another 10% year-over-year gain.\nFor analyst Wlodarczak, Amazon presents a solid tale of strength and growth. He writes of the company, \u201cAmazon has a deep moat around their core businesses driven by their unmatched scale and has what appears to be the largest organic revenue growth opportunity of any mega cap tech company (other than arguably NVDA (N/R)) driven primarily by their AWS cloud segment (which we expect to grow from 17% of revenue to ~35% in 5 years), extension of their e-commerce/fulfillment arms into new segments/internationally, continued rapid growth in their advertising business and proven ability to develop new successful products/revenue streams.\u201d\nLooking ahead, Wlodarczak goes on to explain why investors should continue to buy in on AMZN: \u201cThis is all enhanced by what we believe is the highest potential of their peers to materially boost operating margins driven by scale, leveraging robotics/AI and benefits from an increasing % of revenue from high margin cloud computing/advertising combined with what appears to be an attractive valuation.\u201d\nAs expected, after comments like these, Wlodarczak rates Amazon stock as a Buy. His price target, set at $260, points toward a one-year upside potential of 39%. (To watch Wlodarczak\u2019s track record, click here)\nThis major retailer/tech firm has picked up plenty of attention from Wall Street, and mostly all positive. The Strong Buy consensus is based on a lopsided Buy/Hold split of 45 to 2 among the analyst reviews, and the $224.38 average price target implies a 20% upside from the current trading price of $186.89. (See Amazon stock forecast)\nAlphabet\nThe second Mag 7 stock we\u2019ll look at is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and the market\u2019s fourth-largest public company, with a market cap of just over $2 trillion. Alphabet, which also owns YouTube and has been developing an ever-growing presence in the AI field, has built its success on its absolute dominance of the global internet search segment \u2013 and the advantages that brings in the field of digital advertising. Remember that Google and YouTube are the world\u2019s leaders in online search and online video search, respectively.\nIn the last few years, the AI boom has begun to shift the tech landscape in ways that are still not fully clear. Alphabet has been moving to adopt the new technology, seeing it as a multiplier for online search, and as a powerful tool in online and cloud-based applications. The company is using AI tech in its multimodal large language models, which improve both Google\u2019s online translation apps and its search engine functionality. These improvements in generating search results and translation matrixes are a direct response to increased competition from Microsoft\u2019s Bing as well as ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms.\nOn the practical side, Alphabet has released its Gemini platform, its most up-to-date offering in AI. Gemini is based on a core of large language models, designed from the start to understand natural language content \u2013 in text, audio, images, video, and even in code. The platform uses AI to provide the maximum flexibility for the end user\u2019s application, and Alphabet is working to integrate it into all of its products. That includes the Android operating system, which will make Gemini\u2019s AI available on smartphones \u2013 and all of their apps. For Alphabet, the key challenge presented by AI will be maintaining market share in online search as the digital world switches its base to generative AI tools and apps.\nFor now, Alphabet is generating solid revenue and income numbers. The company brought in $84.7 billion in 2Q24, a total that was up nearly 14% from the prior-year quarter and was more than $445 million over the forecast. Alphabet\u2019s bottom line of $1.89 per share was 5 cents over expectations. Analysts are expecting to see revenues of $86.23 billion when the company reports earnings for Q3 later this month.\nTurning again to Pivotal\u2019s Wlodarczak, we find the analyst taking an upbeat view of Alphabet\u2019s stock, its position and prospects. He says, \u201cIf the status quo holds, GOOG appears to be in a very strong competitive position with a deep moat around their dominant core search business model (~90% market share ex China) and an obvious path to leverage 90%+ (ex China) global device presence (which we believe will dominate consumer AI assistant use), a strong AI platform and financial might to increase financial incentives to handset manufacturers for default AI placement. GOOG also holds a strong #3 position in cloud computing, which we believe has dramatic growth potential\u2026\u201d\nLooking ahead, Wlodarczak adds, \u201cThis position is enhanced by the fact that GOOG appears to have the ability, leveraging their AI investment, to significantly reduce their cost structure (mainly through a material reduction in their ~180K employees) offset partially by the aforementioned potentially higher TAC to extend their search handset dominance to AI (if they are not prohibited in doing so by regulators/courts), which should help drive strong financial growth and help them generate a reasonable AI ROIC even if the development of AI revenue generating applications takes longer than expected.\u201d\nIt should come as no surprise that the Pivotal analyst rates GOOGL shares as a Buy, while his price target, $215, suggests an upside of 30% on the one-year horizon.\nFor the Street generally, this is another stock with a Strong Buy consensus. The 39 recent reviews include 30 Buys to 9 Holds. Shares are priced at $165.16 and have an average target price of $201.57, implying a gain of 22% by this time next year.

        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) is in the spotlight, as supporters of Israel are dismayed by a recent video promoting an upcoming AWS event in Las Vegas. In the video, the AWS vice president of Global Specialists and Partner Organizations, Ruba Borno, is shown wearing an inflammatory piece of jewelry \u2013 a necklace pendant in the shape of Israel, with a Palestinian flag across it. Initially, instead of addressing this erasure of the State of Israel, an Amazon spokesperson declined to comment about Borno\u2019s choice of jewelry, according to the Jewish Insider.\nHowever, an Amazon spokesperson did respond to a request from TipRanks for comment. The spokesperson said, \u201cThe violence and loss of life happening every day in the Middle East is tragic, and at Amazon, our hearts and thoughts are with any person or community that\u2019s affected. Our leadership remains in regular contact with our teams based in the region to offer our support. The video shot was not meant to be a political statement, but we\u2019ve taken down the video and will repost a new one in the coming days.\u201d\nRegardless, this incident is causing consternation among founders and employees of Israel\u2019s tech sector. The pendant worn by the AWS vice president is reminiscent of the genocidal \u201cRiver to the Sea\u2026\u201d chant that\u2019s common among anti-Israel protesters, referring to a wish to have all Jews leave Israel.\nFor now, Amazon is holding steady, with only a 2% fall in the past three months and a 2.8% rise over the past six months. Ten days before earnings, analysts are optimistic on AMZN stock, with the average Amazon consensus price target implying an upside of 18.8%.\nSupporters of Israel, aka the \u201cStart-Up Nation,\u201d are upset about about this Amazon\u2019s employee\u2019s apparent genocidal wish to wipe Israel off the map. Some executives have started commenting that they will now leave Amazon AWS for other solutions, so competitors like Microsoft (MSFT) could benefit from this public relations disaster.\nIt remains to be seen if Amazon\u2019s stock will fall in the wake of this incident.\n"

        "Title": "Amazon Earnings Preview: The Weakest of the Magnificent 7?",
        "Author": "  Ethan Feller ",
        "Text": "Of all the Magnificent 7 stocks, Amazon (AMZN) has been the most challenging for investors to own over the last several years. While all the other companies in the group excluding Tesla are trading significantly higher than their 2021 highs, Amazon languishes. Amazon\u2019s stock price is at the same price as it was in July 2021. May this lack of progress in the stock price be an opportunity for discerning investors?\nAmazon's stock has moved sideways over the past three years, allowing its valuation to become increasingly attractive as the company\u2019s earnings have continued to grow. This period of stagnation in share price, combined with steady profit and sales growth, appears to have positioned the stock at a more appealing level for investors.\nToday, Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting flat earnings revisions. However, with its historically cheap valuation and strong growth forecasts, it may be an attractive addition to investors\u2019 portfolios. Amazon reports earnings Thursday, October 24. This analysis will examine the upcoming earnings expectations for Amazon's e-commerce and cloud computing segments, as well as the potential impact of artificial intelligence on the business, to assess whether the stock presents a worthwhile investment opportunity. We will also compare Amazon to two other Magnificent 7 members \u2013 Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nDespite the less than encouraging stock price action, Amazon has continuously posted strong earnings over the past year. During the last four quarterly earnings meetings, Amazon has beaten analysts\u2019 expectations every time with an average beat of 31.13%. Although the Zacks earnings ESP is not projecting an earnings beat this quarter, earnings are projected to grow nicely nonetheless, and sales are expected to progress nicely as well.\nAmazon Web Services, its cloud computing business, continues to dominate the highly competitive cloud services market, and last quarter reported a $100 billion annual revenue run rate. Most notably, web services revenue growth has been reaccelerating and shows continued expansion in margins. Artificial intelligence is and will continue to be a major catalyst for AWS, as its intense demand for computing power should power more growth in the years ahead.\nRegarding the retail business, analysts are expecting close to double digit year over year growth although there are still some concerns. Expanding internationally offers growth opportunities for Amazon but also brings challenges, including the negative impact of currency fluctuations on e-commerce results, especially with the strong dollar putting pressure on profitability. Additionally, competition is intensifying as traditional retailers like Walmart and Target enhance their e-commerce capabilities, while regional rivals such as MercadoLibre, Flipkart, and Alibaba pose significant threats in key international markets.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are all major players in the cloud computing space, with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, respectively. While AWS leads the market share, both Azure and Google Cloud have been rapidly expanding their capabilities, with Alphabet leveraging its AI expertise and Microsoft integrating cloud services with its software ecosystem.\nIn terms of valuation, Alphabet appears attractively priced at 21.6x forward earnings, which is below its five-year median of 23.8x. Microsoft, on the other hand, trades at a higher valuation of 32x forward earnings, above its five-year median of 22.3x. Meanwhile, Amazon is trading at 38.5x forward earnings, significantly lower than its five-year median of 70.1x, suggesting potential value as the stock has lagged despite continued growth in earnings and cloud revenues.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon's stock has been challenging for investors over the past several years, especially compared to other \"Magnificent 7\" stocks. While companies like Alphabet and Microsoft have climbed well beyond their 2021 highs, Amazon's stock price is still languishing around the same level as it was in mid-2021. This lack of progress could be an opportunity for patient investors who see potential in the company's evolving business and improving valuation.\nDespite stagnant stock performance, Amazon's valuation has become more attractive as earnings and revenues have continued to grow. AMZN has also spawned multibillion dollar new businesses like Advertising, Alexa and Prime video which continue to grow nicely and give another reason to never count this technology juggernaut out of the race.\nAs Amazon heads into its earnings report on October 24, key segments to watch include e-commerce, where nearly double-digit growth is expected, and Amazon Web Services, which continues to lead the cloud computing market. And while of course risks remain, Amazon's steady business growth, attractive valuation, and leading cloud position make it worth considering for investors willing to look beyond short-term challenges.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Maleha Afzal ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Most Promising Long-Term Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we will look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.\nThe labor market has been more resilient than ever. On October 4, Gary Cohn, the IBM vice chairman, and former US National Economic Council director in the Trump administration, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the job report and the US economy.\nCohn suggests that the jobs data is the least scientific information the government puts out and therefore, it must be taken with a grain of salt. However, he emphasizes the importance of understanding trends. The number of people entering the workforce is expanding and jobs are being created, deducing that the market is in a neutral place.\nCohn believes that the US economy is normalizing. He reveals that we have not lived in a normal economy in over a decade, therefore, relative to history, the status quo is fairly reasonable. He adds that the Fed has orchestrated a soft landing and expects another 50 basis point cut before the end of 2024, which according to him is still restrictive.\nAs the AI flame starts to settle, the market may be up for a major shift. On October 7, Keith Buchanan, GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss his expectations of the market.\nExpectations for earnings have been revised from mid-single digits to mid-double digitals, promising robust growth as 2024 comes to a close. Buchanan suggests that most of the growth comes from artificial intelligence and the widening of earnings growth beyond traditional growth sectors like technology.\nThis year, the industrial and energy sectors have enjoyed greater returns capturing a large chunk of the market. Buchanan is highly bullish on AI plays and value stocks. He also adds that names in financials, industrials, and consumer discretionary are poised for growth ahead of 2024. He advises investors to consider geopolitical events before making any investment decisions.\nNow that we have assessed the future of the financial markets and possible sectors eyeing growth, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo find the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds, we went over multiple rankings over the internet to list long-term blue chip stocks. We then examined the analyst upside and the hedge fund sentiment of these stocks as of Q2 2024 and picked the most popular ones. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024 as a primary metric and analyst upside as of October 13, as a secondary metric.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAnalyst Upside as of October 13, 2024: 17%\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks first on our list of the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. The technology company is an e-commerce giant that also provides streaming and data cloud services.\nThe company launched its e-commerce platform in 1994 and is now close to capturing 40% of the market in the United States. Amazon Web Services (AWS), its proprietary cloud service, reported an 18.8% revenue growth during the second quarter of 2024.\nThis year, the company achieved significant milestones. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has not only been actively involved in the development of AI hardware and software but has also\u00a0signed partnerships with the government and AI startups. Speaking of innovation, on October 11, the company launched its first autonomous robot, Proteus. The autonomous robot fulfills miscellaneous tasks in the Amazon fulfillment centers independently and safely.\nOn the artificial intelligence front, AWS is housing the next generation of Llama models from Meta, enabling customers to build and deploy AI applications freely. In addition to that, the company also launched an AI personal assistant in September that helps Amazon sellers meet the unique needs of their customers.\nOverall, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is poised to become a complete artificial intelligence company as it adapts to autonomous technologies and AI-backed systems, contributing to its ranking on our list.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the most promising long-term stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "Text": "Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Amazon.com fair value estimate is US$335\nAmazon.com's US$188 share price signals that it might be 44% undervalued\n Analyst price target for AMZN is US$221 which is 34% below our fair value estimate\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$72.1b\nUS$95.5b\nUS$113.7b\nUS$134.2b\nUS$149.5b\nUS$162.5b\nUS$173.7b\nUS$183.3b\nUS$191.8b\nUS$199.5b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x19\nAnalyst x11\nAnalyst x6\nAnalyst x4\nEst @ 11.40%\nEst @ 8.73%\nEst @ 6.86%\nEst @ 5.55%\nEst @ 4.64%\nEst @ 4.00%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.7% \nUS$67.6k\nUS$83.8k\nUS$93.5k\nUS$103.4k\nUS$108.0k\nUS$110.0k\nUS$110.1k\nUS$108.9k\nUS$106.8k\nUS$104.0k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$996b\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.7%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$200b\u00d7 (1 + 2.5%) \u00f7 (6.7%\u2013 2.5%) = US$4.8t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.7%)10= US$2.5t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.5t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$188, the company appears quite undervalued at a 44% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.026. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Amazon Web Services, the world\u2019s biggest cloud-computing provider, said that new systems running Nvidia Corp.\u2019s Blackwell chips probably won\u2019t be online until early next year, a later timeline than originally anticipated.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA Broken Oil Pipeline Plunges South Sudan\u2019s Capital Into Chaos\nDrug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives\nCities Look to AI to Flag Residents\u2019 Trash and Recycling Mistakes\nInside the \u2018Utopias\u2019 of Mexico City\nOne City\u2019s Plan to Re-Link a Neighborhood That Robert Moses Divided\nWhen Nvidia introduced the new generation of processors in March, it said that partners like Amazon would have Blackwell-based products ready by the end of 2024. But after a production change \u2014 dubbed a respin \u2014 Amazon is still waiting to get major quantities of the chip to put into its data centers.\nNvidia\u2019s timelines have \u201cshifted,\u201d AWS Chief Executive Officer Matt Garman said Thursday on Bloomberg Television. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re working with them and we have early samples, but as they get their yields up from the respin of the Blackwell chip, it\u2019ll probably be early next year before we get production samples in real volume.\u201d\nInvestors are keenly focused on when Nvidia\u2019s latest product will get into the hands of customers and put to use. The chipmaker has become one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies on the strength of runaway demand for its artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia has said that \u2014 even after production delays \u2014 it expects to get billions of dollars of revenue from the processor in the fourth quarter.\nAWS will be the first to deploy computers based on the new chip in significant quantities, Garman said, giving it a unique view into Blackwell\u2019s progress.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the\u00a010 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.\nVolatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market.\nA report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds\u00a0and\u00a0David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy.\nWhile expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells.\nThe economist maintains we are marching on ice that\u2019s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.\u201d\n\u201cBut there\u2019s been some cracks in the business cycle,\u201d he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at \u201csuper high\u201d levels.\nA slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election.\nWhile the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around.\n\u201cHistorically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,\u201d Cohen said.\nAlthough there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows.\nAI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta\u2019s share price surge due to strong sales growth.\nAnalysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value.\nPixabay/ Public Domain\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst\u2019s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 308\nAnalyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 20.45%\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a market leader in cloud computing and e-commerce retail, affirming its long-term growth prospects. The company generates a significant chunk of its revenues from e-commerce, with a market share of 37.6%.\nCloud computing is increasingly becoming an essential piece of the puzzle amid artificial intelligence, as the company has a market share of 31% in the multibillion-dollar industry. The segment posted an 18.8% revenue increase in Q2 and has reported 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters.\nLikewise, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is diversifying its operations into the fiercely competitive streaming service ad-supported market. As the US tech giant intensifies its push into ad-funded streaming services, it plans to introduce more ads across its popular TV series and films on Prime Video in the upcoming year.\nBy the end of the year, Amazon is expected to have $127.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, which will be three times its 2018 total. It is also expected to have nearly $400 billion in cash by 2027, far exceeding its competitors in the Big Tech sector.\nThis is an incredible transformation for a business known for operating on thin margins, reinvesting most of its profits, and having comparatively little cash compared to its peers.\nRecord profits from cloud computing, advertising, and increased efficiency, including cost reduction, are the main drivers of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) \u2018s cash increase. S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that the company\u2019s free cash flow will almost double from $36.8 billion last year to $70.8 billion in 2025.\nAfter other tech companies like Alphabet and Meta began giving back more of their cash to shareholders earlier this year, there was a surge in hopes for an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) dividend or at least more share buybacks in recent quarters. Likewise, analysts on Wall Street rate the stock as a Buy with an average price target of $222.95, implying 20.45% upside potential from current levels. According to our Insider Monkey database, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion.\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon\u2019s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.\u201d\nOverall AMZN\u00a0ranks 8th\u00a0on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "When Amazon (AMZN) announced its expansion into Nashville, including a new headquarters there, the move marked the single largest jobs commitment made by a company in Tennessee\u2019s history.\nThe data shows the tech giant's arrival has made a difference in the economy too.\n\u201cLike any economist, I was skeptical before I saw the results,\u201d said Vikram Pathania, one of Amazon\u2019s principal economists. \u201cYou see employment go up, you see income go up, and you see these indicators move positively.\u201d\nIn 2023, Amazon\u2019s investments contributed $4 billion to Tennessee\u2019s gross domestic product and supported 15,000 indirect jobs, according to data provided by the company. Additional findings show that when the company moves into a county, that county can expect its employment-to-population ratio to increase by 1.7% on average.\nThe company touted that for every 10 jobs that it created directly, nine additional jobs were indirectly created as well.\n\u201cThe very act of building a new warehouse means hiring local construction companies, and so sometimes you start to notice the effects by year one, definitely by year two. And by year three, the numbers are coming through,\u201d Pathania said. \"But there\u2019s also an indirect channel because we are employing people and putting wages in their pockets. Those people are then going and spending that money at local businesses.\"\nAt the company\u2019s Delivering the Future event held this week in Nashville, Amazon showcased its innovations \u2014 from artificial intelligence to robotics \u2014 and highlighted its presence within the community.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just creating jobs \u2014 we\u2019re creating different opportunities and pathways that make us a part of the community and not just a corporate citizen within the community,\u201d Amazon\u2019s vice president of worldwide economic development, Holly Sullivan, told Yahoo Finance over the phone.\nWhen Amazon first announced plans to open its second North American headquarters (HQ2) in 2017, cities across the US set out to entice it to invest in their communities.\nThe e-commerce giant initially announced its HQ2 would be split between New York City and Arlington, Va., which offered Amazon $750 million in state taxpayer subsidies. However, the company canceled the New York location after backlash from local grassroots organizers, residents, and politicians, who opposed the billions in government incentives offered to the company.\nA year later, Amazon announced plans to invest in Nashville instead, with the goal of creating nearly 5,000 jobs in the music capital. Nashville\u2019s then-mayor, David Briley, hailed it as fantastic news for the city, while the governor called it a \u201cgame changer\u201d for Tennessee.\n\u201cWe want to go into locations that support us and support that job growth,\u201d Amazon's Sullivan said. \u201cNashville is a great example of this. We started with our fulfillment operations, and now we have a major corporate office with over 3,000 employees.\u201d\nAmazon completed construction of its office last year, providing 1 million square feet of space for its employees, whose roles range from technical jobs, such as software development engineers, to providing financial and business services.\nAmazon has rapidly expanded its global footprint in recent years. In 2020 alone, the e-commerce giant added 300 new warehouses, according to data gathered by Consumer Reports. MWPVL International, a supply chain and logistics consulting firm, found that Amazon operates over 1,300 active locations in the US, occupying 435 million square feet.\nAmazon's booming warehouse construction hasn't been well-received by everyone, and some municipalities have placed restrictions on building Amazon's logistics network, citing concerns over pollution, construction, and congestion.\nBut when it comes to where Amazon will expand next, the company is focused on technological innovation. Priorities for the business \u2014 think artificial intelligence \u2014 will drive the thought process about the locations it invests in. As of now, the company has plans to spend more than $100 billion over the next decade on data centers, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cCloud computing is a big investment for us, particularly with artificial intelligence,\u201d Sullivan said.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on the Magnificent Seven Stocks Plus Netflix.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other magnificent stocks in Jim Cramer's list.\nOn Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique \"Poltergeist 2 magic.\"\nCramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zero-sum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market.\n\u201cUnlike previous Mag 7 rallies, this one\u2019s definitely not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can roar, too, in this market, perhaps because there\u2019s just a lot of money going around.\u201d\nHe noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable.\n\u201cWe know these stocks will once again be hit by endless worries, giving you more opportunities to buy and more weakness before they snap right back and start climbing all over again.\u201d\nCramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial four-week earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added:\n\u201cWhy stress about how quickly the Fed will cut rates, Oh? God, I'm sick of that. What matters is they're giving vast swaths of the economy a big boost and I doubt they'll stop anytime soon.\u201d\nCramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nCramer thinks that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has various growth avenues, especially AWS. He said:\n\u201cAmazon's easy. It got hammered down from $187 to $161 after that last quarter, but it's back above $187 now. I think the company simply has too many levers, including the incredible growth for the Amazon Web Services, which [can] take it back, I think, to its $200 high.\u201d\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the most famous global technology companies and it specializes in online retail, advertising, and subscription services. A significant aspect of its operations is its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has emerged as a crucial source of operating profit. Over the past year, AWS has seen accelerating sales growth, reflecting a broader trend as businesses increasingly migrate their data systems to the cloud.\nThe transition is particularly relevant as companies seek to leverage artificial intelligence tools, presenting substantial opportunities for Amazon's future expansion. In the second quarter, AWS reported sales of $26.3 billion, marking a 19% increase compared to the previous year. Alongside its cloud segment, the company has also identified advertising as a key growth area. In the same quarter, revenue from advertising services rose by 20% year-over-year, slightly outpacing the growth experienced by AWS.\nRecently, on October 10, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) revealed that its Prime Big Deal Days event set new records for October shopping events. This year, a greater number of Prime members participated compared to the previous year, taking advantage of early holiday promotions. The two-day event kicked off the holiday shopping season with record sales, surpassing all previous October events in terms of items sold.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Eleanor Pringle ",
        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s push to get employees back into the office five days a week is boiling down to a rather blunt argument: If staffers don\u2019t like it, they can work elsewhere.\nAt an all-hands meeting for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit, CEO Matt Garman bluntly told colleagues that if they didn\u2019t like the controversial policy, they should leave.\nThe tech giant\u2019s push to get employees back to their in-office desks five days a week hasn\u2019t been simple.\nIn February last year, some 16,000 employees joined a Slack channel and launched a petition to oppose CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s call to return to the office for \u201cthe majority of the week.\u201d\nIn February 2023, that meant only three days a week, but by September 2024, it was increased to mandatory in-office attendance every day of the working week starting from January 2025.\nIn an internal call this week\u2014first reported by Reuters\u2014Garman doubled down on the decision, saying Amazon didn\u2019t want employees who couldn\u2019t handle being in the office that frequently.\n\u201cIf there are people who just don\u2019t work well in that environment and don\u2019t want to, that\u2019s okay, there are other companies around,\u201d Garman said, per Reuters.\n\u201cBy the way, I don\u2019t mean that in a bad way,\u201d he continued. He said he wanted staff to be \u201cin an environment where we\u2019re working together.\u201d\nGarman said he isn\u2019t seeing enough evidence to support the idea that the Jeff Bezos\u2013founded company is innovating fast enough under a hybrid working model, adding: \u201cWhen we want to really, really innovate on interesting products, I have not seen an ability for us to do that when we\u2019re not in-person.\u201d\nGiven the fact that teams were in for three days\u2014and not necessarily the same three days\u2014\u201cwe didn\u2019t really accomplish anything, like, we didn\u2019t get to work together and learn from each other,\u201d Garman reportedly added.\nAmazon did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\nAccording to a transcript of the all-hands seen by CNBC, Garman insisted that of the colleagues he has spoken to, \u201cnine out of 10\u201d are looking forward to the new mandate being enforced.\nPerhaps Garman has just been lucky with the people he has spoken to, as staffers posting on social media sites and internal channels have expressed their fury at the goalposts once again changing\u2014impacting their commute and family dynamics.\n\u201cAmazon has announced 5-day RTO, which is unfortunate because I\u2019m interested in working for a living, not live-action role playing and virtue signaling,\u201d an Amazon Web Services engineer posted on LinkedIn with an accompanying #OpenToWork banner signaling their intention to leave the company.\n\u201cIf you have remote opportunities available, please message me,\u201d the staffer continued. \u201cNothing is off the table. I\u2019d rather go back to school than work in an office again.\u201d\nTech staffers looking to leave Amazon for a rival face uncertain prospects, with layoffs sweeping through companies offering a more flexible office-to-hybrid working structure.\nMeta, for example, allows its staff to work from home two days a week, and Google has a similar policy.\nMicrosoft on the other hand allows staff to work as flexibly as they want, with a VP at the company recently telling staffers the policy will stay in place as long as productivity remains high.\nAmazon\u2019s culture is very closely linked to its leadership principles, many of which hark back to the days when billionaire entrepreneur Bezos was at the helm.\nCurrent CEO Andy Jassy is still a proponent of the principles, with Garman reportedly adding that teams not being together, in-person and full-time, is getting in the way of these guiding ideas.\nSpeaking of the leadership principles, Garman is reported to have said: \u201cYou can\u2019t internalize them by reading them on the website, you really have to experience them day-to-day.\u201d\nAlong with well-known ideas like Amazon\u2019s \u201ccustomer obsession,\u201d there is the notion of disagree and commit, where individuals voice their opinions but join the general consensus whether or not they agree.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you guys have tried to disagree via a Chime call,\u201d Garman continued, referring to an internal messaging platform. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "Author": "  Jennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is up 24% this year, just edging out the S&P 500. It may not provide the same earth-shattering gains it did for early investors, but it's likely to be a market-beating stock for the foreseeable future. At this later investment stage, that comes with added security. Here are three reasons to believe it's still a no-brainer buy.\nMost investors know Amazon as the largest e-commerce company in the world, and that's still its core business and a massive growth driver. Amazon accounts for more than one in three e-commerce sales dollars, a lead so vast that it would be impossible for any competitor to challenge it in the near future.\nIt lost some ground during the pandemic's height, when there was an unexpected surge of new businesses going online. But it's expected to grab more market share going forward, racing past 40% of all e-commerce sales this year and increasing its share next year, according to eMarketer.\nE-commerce itself is expected to grow as a percentage of retail sales, from 20.3% this year to 23% in 2027. That's an organic growth driver for Amazon's business. But organic or not, Amazon is setting itself up to win, keep challenges at bay, and drive higher revenue and margins.\nThe stores segment increased 9% year over year in the U.S. and 10% internationally. Considering the huge base on which the percentages are increasing, those are impressive metrics equal to billions of dollars. CEO Andy Jassy said shoppers are still switching down to lower-priced brands and products due to inflation, so those numbers could accelerate as inflation moderates.\nManagement sees plenty of opportunities to lower costs through robotics, great regionalization, and building out its same-day shipping facilities.\nE-commerce may still be Amazon's largest business, accounting for about 62% of sales in the second quarter, but Amazon Web Services is by far the more profitable segment, accounting for 63% of operating income. Don't be fooled by its accounting for less of Amazon's total sales -- it's still the largest cloud company in the world, accounting for 31% of the entire market and edging out top-tier players like Microsoft and Alphabet.\nAnd Amazon is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in carving out its niche in generative artificial intelligence (AI). Like everything else Amazon does, it's doing generative AI in a big way. It wants to be everything to everyone, and that means an unparalleled lineup of services to meet every kind of need, from the smaller business that needs turnkey solutions to enterprise customers that need the most precise customization. Since it's larger than anyone else, and its AI business has already reached a billion-dollar run rate, it can afford to invest and to offer its services at more competitive rates. So while it partners with leader Nvidia for the best chips, it's also developing its own chips to compete on price.\nManagement still sees this as only the early innings in this business, and Amazon is poised to benefit from a continuing shift to the cloud and AI.\nAdvertising has become Amazon's fastest-growing segment, up 20% year over year in the second quarter (ended June 30). Amazon has the obvious reach advertisers are looking for, especially third-party sellers who are looking to bring eyes to their product pages.

        "Text": "Leading the charge toward no carbon emissions, Amazon(AMZN, Financial) made a $500 million investment in nuclear power, causing a spike in nuclear shares, including Oklo (OKLO, Financial), NuScale Power (SMR, Financial), Nano Nuclear Energy (NNE, Financial), and Lightbridge (LTBR, Financial). This shift looks to shift the focus of the tech giants toward sustainability, a trend across the entire industry of sustainable energy.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nOn Wednesday, AWS added the signing of three critical deals to expand nuclear energy production, including building multiple SMRs. This program sweeps with Amazon's Climate Pledge of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. Among the above-listed agreements, special attention is paid to the cooperation agreement with Energy Northwest to build four innovative SMRs in Washington on land, initially producing 320 MW of electricity and increasing capacity to 960 MW.\nTo strengthen its nuclear ambition, Amazon collaborates with X-energy to deploy its atomic reactor designs in the Energy Northwest projects. This comprises increasing manufacturing capabilities for SMR equipment necessary to deliver five gigawatts of new nuclear projects.\nFurther, AWS and Dominion Energy of Virginia are keen to execute an SMR project near the North Anna nuclear power station to deliver at least 300MW to the region.\nSpecifically, the CEO of AWS, Matt Garman, pointed out that nuclear energy is one of the scalable and carbon-free sources that help companies fulfill their obligations and make the world carbon-free. While this incremental opening mounted by Amazon in itself throws added momentum into its plans and strategies, it also exercises a stunning impact on the collective efforts toward the promotion of greener energy solutions as a primary preference in the tech sphere.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +1.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 7.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +34.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +63.5%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 indicates a change of +23.1% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $157.06 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9.8%. The $634.43 billion and $702.71 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.4% and +10.8%, respectively.\nAmazon reported revenues of $147.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.63 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.44%. The EPS surprise was +17.14%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "The Uranium stocks have popped as significant tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN, Financial), Microsoft (MSFT, Financial), and Alphabet (GOOGL, Financial) deepen their nuclear power bets. It started with Microsoft's power purchase agreement made last month that will revamp the Three Mile Island Nuclear Station for AI's burgeoning growth.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nThis week, we saw the spectrum shifting a gear higher as a giant such as Amazon revealed partnerships with Energy Northwest, Dominion Energy, and X-energy to pursue Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which have thus brightened up investor confidence in the sector. On the same day, Google's parent company Alphabet was revealed to be investing $10 million in Kairos Power to develop the initial 500MW of advanced small modular reactor facilities, all in a sign of a sector switching to more compact and environmentally friendly power generation technology.\nThe market confronting them responded sharply and violently. New interesting information about uranium mining and nuclear energy Company Cameco (CCJ, Financial) rocketed 8.2%, Denison Mines (DNN, Financial) and Clean Energy Fuels (CLNE, Financial) went 14.7 % per share higher and 17% higher, respectively. NuScale Power (SMR, Financial, which was revealed earlier had a large stake in the SMR market, rocketed up by a magnificent 31.6% and reached its highest point ever.\nThe enthusiasm for nuclear power is underpinned by the IAEA's latest forecasts on nuclear capability, which indicate a probability of a 2.5-fold increase in capacity by 2050. This projection is in line with the rising global push to escalate nuclear deployment as part of the plan to realize net-zero carbon emissions.\nClosely following this, tech giants set the pace, investing in nuclear power. They did not merely ignite the upturn of relevant stocks, but they also indicated nuclear energy as a crucial factor that could shape the future energy scenario, generating a cleaner and more sustainable energy mix.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Billionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024.\u00a0Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0Ken Fisher\u00a0regularly shares his investing wisdom on his YouTube channel, sharing market insights and lessons he\u2019s learned over the decades. Commenting about the Fed\u2019s rate cut, Fisher recently advised investors not to focus on what the central bank is doing and instead pay attention to long-term investing.\n\u201cThe fact is, and I\u2019ve said this for a long time, I won\u2019t live forever, but I hope to live a long time and keep saying it: central bankers are crazy. Throughout my life, central banks have operated on flawed ideas and groupthink, which is an inefficient way to manage markets.\u201d\nFisher gave an example of how you could end up losing money following the herd mentality when it comes to central bank moves.\n\u201cIf you had followed the common belief that when the Fed and other central banks hike rates, you should get out of stocks, that would have worked for a couple of months in 2022. By the middle of the summer of 2022, during the height of rate hikes, you would have been on the wrong side of the market. From June 2022 onward, as the Fed hiked rates by 75 basis points nearly every month, the market was just a few months away from rising, leading to the bull market we\u2019re in now, in 2024.\nFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher\u2019s hedge fund\u2019s Q2 holdings and picked its top AI investments. We have analyzed the AI-related growth catalysts for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nBillionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s Stake:\u00a0$8,460,561,806\nCantor Fitzgerlad recently initiated coverage of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with an Overweight rating and said in a broader industry note that despite strong performance, many tech stocks remain attractively valued.\n\u201cDespite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names are fairly reasonable and should benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth and as benefits from widespread cost-cutting fade,\u201d Cantor said.\nAWS\u2019s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Billionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google announced Monday it was backing the nuclear power and signed an agreement with Kairos Power to construct a series of SMRs that use molten-salt cooling technology.\nData center expansion and other factors are expected to drive electricity demand up 15% to 20% over the next decade, according to the US Energy Department. Data centers could consume as much as 9% of the nation\u2019s electricity generation annually by 2030, up from 4% in 2023, according to a report in May by the nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute.\nAmazon has also signed agreements with Washington State-based utility Energy Northwest and Virginia\u2019s Dominion Energy, Inc. to develop SMR projects. Amazon said the reactors \u2014 which will be constructed, owned and operated by Energy Northwest \u2014 were expected to generate roughly 320 megawatts, with the option to expand to 960 megawatts total.\nIn Virginia, Amazon said it had signed an agreement with Dominion to explore the development of an SMR project at the utility\u2019s existing North Anna nuclear power station that could bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the region.\nUnlike traditional nuclear reactors, which are enormous facilities that take years to build, SMRs can be built at factories, delivered by truck or train, and then assembled on-site, saving time and money. Utilities can install just one or bundle several together, expanding the potential market by including countries that don\u2019t need a big conventional nuclear plant.\nStill, the technology hasn\u2019t yet been deployed at scale, commercially.\nAnd SMR\u2019s have their critics, including those who say the economics of nuclear power is flawed no matter what the size of the reactors. NuScale Power Corp. announced in November it was canceling plans to build a series of SMRs in Utah amid surging costs.\nMeanwhile, surging demand for power is prompting utilities to build more natural gas-fired plants, undermining lofty environmental goals for both the industry and tech firms.\n\u201cArtificial intelligence may be new, but claims that the next revolutionary nuclear technology will solve our energy problems have been around since we first split the atom,\u201d Johanna Neumann, an official with Environment America, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Big Tech to recommit to solutions that work and pose less risk to our environment and health, including making data centers as energy efficient as possible and committing them to be powered by new renewable energy sources.\u201d\n(Adds comment from Amazon executive in fourth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAI Detectors Falsely Accuse Students of Cheating\u2014With Big Consequences\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs\nNeuralink Co-Founder\u2019s New Startup Sells a Brain Computer Toolkit\nA Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work\nHow Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Dominion Energy D has recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Amazon.com AMZN to explore innovative new development structures for enhancing potential Small Modular Reactor (\u201cSMR\u201d) nuclear development in Virginia. This should further boost D\u2019s footprint in the expanding power demand market in the state of Virginia by tapping into the less explored SMR technology.The latest agreement should enable Dominion Energy and Amazon to promote SMR development and financing while reducing the possible risks to consumers and capital sources in terms of cost and development.\nUtilities, state and federal authorities, as well as top technology companies are investigating SMR as a viable solution that would offer reliable, carbon-free power as the demand for electricity in Virginia and other U.S. areas has been rising at an unprecedented level.Alike traditional nuclear, SMRs generate around-the-clock, carbon-free power, but with a significantly smaller footprint and lower upfront capital costs.In Virginia, the need for power is predicted to double over the next fifteen years, with an annual growth rate above 5%. To support this remarkable expansion, Dominion Energy is creating an \"all-of-the-above\" mix of new power production sources, including innovative investments in offshore wind, solar, battery storage and natural gas.To this end, Dominion Energy expects SMRs to be an essential component of this \"all-of-the-above\" energy mix in the 2030s. Against this backdrop, the latest MOU seems to be a strategically noteworthy decision undertaken by Dominion Energy to maintain its prowess in the electric utility industry.Earlier, in July 2024, the company released a Request for Proposals, inviting proposals from top SMR nuclear technology companies to assess the viability of developing a SMR at its North Anna Power Station in Louisa County, VA.\nThe development of SMRs can be attributed to the growing desire to include nuclear energy in many countries' clean energy mix due to its potential cost-saving benefits and adaptability.According to a Wood Mackenzie report, published in March 2024, the SMR project pipeline reached 22 gigawatts (GW) in the first quarter of 2024, requiring an investment of close to $176 billion. This offers ample growth opportunities to utilities like Dominion Energy that are putting efforts to incorporate SMR technology in their infrastructure. The company's latest agreement with Amazon is a bright example of that.\nApart from D, another utility provider, Ameren Corporation AEE is set to take advantage of the growing SMR market. \u00a0Ameren Missouri, a unit of AEE, joined forces with Westinghouse Electric Company, seeking investment funds from the U.S. Department of Energy for two SMR projects. This funding included plans for the construction of a Westinghouse SMR at Ameren Missouri's Callaway Energy Center.AEE\u2019s long-term (three to five years) earnings growth rate is 6.58%.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI data center stocks.\nThe AI data center industry is experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the massive computational power they require. AI data centers are specialized facilities designed to handle high-intensity AI workloads, including machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network training. These facilities integrate advanced hardware and software to process large-scale data efficiently, creating a crucial infrastructure for the global digital economy. Leading technology companies are making substantial investments in AI data centers. For instance, Meta announced plans to invest $33 billion in data center expansion to support AI research and development. Google is also investing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, committing $3.3 billion in just one region of the United States\u200b. These investments highlight the significance of AI data centers in the broader tech ecosystem.\nAI workloads demand hardware that can process vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This need has led to the development of AI-specific chips, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These chips are essential components in AI data centers.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nWhile AI data centers are essential for technological progress, they consume enormous amounts of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide account for about 1% of global electricity demand, a figure that could increase significantly with the rise of AI. Cooling systems, necessary to maintain optimal hardware performance, further contribute to this energy demand. To address this, companies are increasingly focused on building energy-efficient data centers. For example, Google has implemented machine learning algorithms to reduce energy use in its data centers by 30%.\nThe AI data center industry will continue to evolve as the demand for AI-driven applications grows. Experts predict a significant shift toward edge computing, where data centers are decentralized and located closer to the source of data generation. This reduces latency and improves performance for real-time AI applications such as autonomous driving and smart cities. Moreover, the integration of quantum computing into AI data centers could revolutionize the field. Quantum computers are capable of processing complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers, making them ideal for AI and big data applications. Companies like IBM and Google are already exploring quantum technology in their AI research.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks.

The report was based on AI infrastructure announcements made by the tech giant in the past few years. Some of the areas in which Amazon has pledged to spend billions to develop data centers include northern Virginia, Oregon, and Mississippi in the US, as well as Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Spain, and the United Kingdom abroad.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Internet Content Stocks to Buy. In this article, we will look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the best internet content stocks.\nAccording to\u00a0Grand View Research, The global digital content creation market value stood at\u00a0$25.6 billion in 2022\u00a0and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% from 2023 to 2030. In 2023, North America dominated the digital content market. The primary drivers are the increasing use of social media and the digital change occurring across different industries. According to a study by Kepios,\u00a062.3%\u00a0of individuals in the entire globe use social media. As of April 2024, the average daily usage is 2 hours and 23 minutes per this study. Kepios analysis reveals that the number of people using social media grew meaningfully during the first three months of 2024, and annual growth rates are still significantly more than 5%.\nContent creation is also being transformed by artificial intelligence. According to Custom Market Insights, the global market for AI-powered content creation was valued at\u00a0$2.3\u00a0billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.7% to reach USD 7.9 billion by 2033. Moreover, AI programs like GPT-4 are being used to generate graphics, music, and text. Gartner projects that 30% of all digital content will be artificial intelligence generated by 2025. This facilitates hyperpersonalization, which allows material to be personalized to specific consumers while also streamlining the content creation process.\nSecondly, the popularity of short-form video material is skyrocketing, emerging as a major trend in the content production industry. Platforms like Instagram Reels and TikTok have paved the way for this movement. In 2024, 85% of marketers anticipate short-form videos to be the most successful type of social media content, according to a HubSpot survey. The snackable aspect of this format makes it ideal for grabbing the attention spans of increasingly transient internet consumers.\nThirdly, digital content is projected to become more interactive in the future. Advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are opening up greater opportunities for immersive experiences. The AR and VR market is expected to reach\u00a0$1.5\u00a0trillion by 2030, according to a PwC report.\nIf we take a broader view, according to the PWC\u2019s Global Entertainment & Media\u00a0Outlook\u00a02024-2028, there are a number of significant growth prospects in the industry, which is expected to reach US$3.4 trillion by 2028. Notwithstanding persistent upheavals and the necessity of reinventing company models, the industry presents substantial income opportunities. Growth is anticipated to be driven by advertising, with spending forecast to reach US $1 trillion by 2026 because of connected TV and internet advertisements. Due to market saturation, streaming services are being forced to investigate ad-supported business models and creative content. Revenues from gaming are predicted to surpass $300 billion by 2028, particularly in Asia Pacific. The industry is still thriving. Companies navigating shifting market dynamics will find more opportunities in high-growth regions and market categories.\nWe sifted through holdings of Internet Content ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 Internet Content stocks. Then we selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among institutional investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nThe most renowned online store and marketplace for independent contractors is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Approximately 75% of overall revenue is generated by retail, with the other 15% coming from services offered by Amazon Web Services, including databases, cloud computing, storage, and other services, and the remaining 5% to 10% from advertising. Germany, the UK, and Japan are the top three overseas markets for Amazon\u2019s non-AWS sales, which account for between 25% and 30% of total revenues.\nAmazon leads the market in the categories it covers, especially e-commerce and cloud services. Owing to its scale and reach, it has emerged as the clear leader in e-commerce and enjoys a variety of competitive advantages that give buyers the best selection of reasonably priced goods available. Despite its modest size, the company is increasing its market share and pursuing the long-term trend of e-commerce. Through Prime, which links Amazon\u2019s e-commerce initiatives, customers who make more frequent purchases from Amazon\u2019s properties consistently generate high-margin recurring revenue. In return, customers get exclusive video content, one-day shipping on millions of items, and other perks that attract both buyers and sellers and create a potent positive feedback loop. The Kindle and other gadgets, which encourage both new users to join and existing ones to stay, further reinforce the ecosystem.\nAlger Spectra Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a renowned online retailer and leader in cloud computing. The company\u2019s Amazon Web Services (AWS) division offers utility-scale cloud solutions that support corporate America\u2019s digital transition. During the quarter, Amazon\u2019s shares contributed to performance as the company reported strong fiscal first-quarter results, with revenues and operating income beating analyst estimates. Notably, AWS revenue growth accelerated, driven by easing cloud cost optimizations, renewed workload migrations, and an increasing contribution from AI workloads. On their earnings call, management highlighted plans to increase capital expenditures to enhance their technology infrastructure, catering to the surging demand for AI-driven computing.\u201d\nIt is also the \u201cLarge Cap Stock Jim Cramer Can\u2019t Stop Talking About.\u201d He says:\n\u201cWe recently bought more Amazon shares because I believe the market was too harsh on their last quarter. Amazon is a buy, and I think it will continue to perform well.\u201d\nThe rise of Prime Video content and increased ad revenue has led Evercore ISI to raise its price objective for the company from $225 to $240 while maintaining an Outperform rating for the shares. The company\u2019s shares are still considered the analyst\u2019s \u201cNumber 1 Large Cap Long\u201d on the Internet. A potential $3 billion to $5.9 billion in increased revenue from APV might support Amazon\u2019s ad growth in 2025.\nKen Fisher\u2019s\u00a0Fisher Asset Management\u00a0is the largest shareholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database. It owns 43,780,397 shares worth $8.46 billion as of Q2.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best internet content stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) stock closed 3% lower Monday as Wells Fargo (WFC) analysts downgraded shares, noting that the company's strength in the cloud services market won\u2019t be enough to stave off other hurdles to its profit margins.\nWells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski downgraded the stock from Overweight to Equal Weight and lowered his price target for the stock from $225 to $183.\n\"AMZN has been a consistent positive revision story, but we believe factors pressure revisions in the near term,\" he wrote in a note Monday.\nChallenges facing Amazon include rising competition from Walmart (WMT), moderating contribution from its ad business to operating income, and high costs linked to its satellite broadband project.\n\"Keeping these headwinds in context, Amazon remains a margin expansion story, just likely a more moderate margin expansion pace than the market expects,\" Gawrelski wrote.\nGawrelski is one of only five Wall Street analysts who don\u2019t recommend buying the popular stock, Bloomberg data shows. He sees shares priced at $187 over the next year. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts see Amazon stock rising over 20% to about $220, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\nAmazon\u2019s most recent earnings report in early August fell short of Wall Street\u2019s forecasts. But strength in its cloud services division, Amazon Web Services, has helped make up for weaker-than-expected growth in retail sales. AWS houses Amazon's AI services, and it generated $26.3 billion in revenue during the company\u2019s second fiscal quarter, ahead of analysts\u2019 forecasts and 19% higher than the year before. Its advertising segment also saw revenue surge 20%, but its $12.8 billion in sales reported for the three months ended June 30 fell just short of expectations.\nAmazon is part of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have posted massive gains over the past year thanks to investor hype over generative artificial intelligence. Amazon stock is up 42% from last year.\nThe rapid expansion of Amazon Web Services has mirrored the AI trend. Amazon\u2019s AWS segment has launched a host of AI tools for developers and consumers over the past year. AWS is making more money renting space in its far-off data centers to customers looking to power hungry AI software. Amazon expects AI to generate billions of dollars of revenue in the coming years. But Wells Fargo thinks advancements in the AI space won\u2019t be enough to offset downsides from Amazon\u2019s other businesses, which could hinder its profit growth.\nWells Fargo\u2019s Gawrelski said rising competition from Walmart\u2019s burgeoning fulfillment services business will put pressure on the fees Amazon can charge merchants for storing, packing, and shipping their products. Gawrelski noted that Walmart\u2019s fulfillment offerings for sellers are about 15% cheaper. If Amazon is forced to lower its fees, that would cut into its income from its retail segment.\nMeanwhile, Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper, its initiative to become a satellite broadband internet service provider and rival to SpaceX\u2019s Starlink, will shave $3 billion off its operating income in 2025 and 2026, Gawrelski estimated. He added that Amazon\u2019s advertising sales will grow at a \u201cmuch more modest pace\u201d between 2025 and 2027.\nAlso on Monday, a judge ruled that the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust case against Amazon will move forward.\nWells Fargo sees Amazon beating expectations in the third quarter. The company raised its third quarter outlook for Amazon\u2019s earnings per share from $1.18 to $1.26, well above the consensus estimate of $1.15, according to Bloomberg data.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

On October 1, Aniket Shah, Jefferies\u2019 global head of sustainability and transition strategy, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss his stance on nuclear energy making a comeback amid the AI boom.\nShah shares that the nuclear energy boom is not surprising. Looking back, the United States signed significant partnerships to boost the supply of nuclear energy years ago, indicating that the value this sector holds is not unknown or recent.\nHe adds that the big tech companies are going to be primary catalysts and will influence the entire market. These companies will invest millions and billions in nuclear energy, making the transition easier for other companies to follow. According to Shah, some key investment areas would be small modular reactors and nuclear fusion.\nShah also acknowledged that the United States held a bipartisan view of the nuclear boom, explaining why regulations and acts in favor of nuclear energy are being passed at notoriously high speeds. While the building blocks of nuclear energy are coming together, Shah remains concerned over the execution. He highlights that the United States does not have enough skilled labor and resources to make the nuclear energy boom a reality and must work extremely hard to make it happen.\nOne of the most opportunistic investment themes in 2024 is AI, the other is electrification, and both require a lot of power. The surge in power demand is in turn driving utility stocks. On October 4, Durgesh Chopra, Evercore ISI managing director, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss how utilities could benefit from AI-driven power demand.\nChopra highlights the biggest catalyst for companies like Vistra and Constellation Energy is data centers\u2019 needs for a 24/7 source of clean energy. Therefore, nuclear companies must grab the opportunity and enter into long-term contracts to lock in future growth as soon as possible.\nThere are multiple projects in the pipeline in the United States, that add up to roughly 1.5 gigawatts of energy, positioning nuclear plants as the next big thing in energy. On the flip side, balancing supply and demand will be a key challenge for companies.\nDespite the challenges, he believes that the market is well-positioned for growth in utilities. Utilities have not seen demand growth in the past decade, but things are finally changing for the sector. Overall, with inflation going down, the sector may experience significant tailwinds. Chopra also emphasized that growth in this sector will yield results in five to seven years.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for the next decade, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries.\nThe company was first launched in 1994 and is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), increased its revenue by 18.8% in Q2 and has reported 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters.\nOver the past few months, the company has not only forged partnerships with AI startups and the government but it has also been actively involved in the development of AI hardware. Recent chips produced by the company include Trainium and Inferentia. On Prime Day, Amazon deployed a quarter million Graviton Chips and 80,000 custom AI chips to manage the surging activity on its platforms.\nSpeaking of AI, AWS is now housing the next generation of Llama models from Meta, giving customers more choices to build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications. On September 19, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched Project Amelia, a selling assistant backed by generative AI, allowing sellers to offer better customer assistance and reach.\nOverall, AWS has close to 31% market share in cloud computing, indicative of its dominance in the market. Now that AWS is increasingly adopting AI-backed systems, the company is poised to become a fully AI-run company in the next few years.\nAnalysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 20% upside from current levels. According to our Insider Monkey database, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc.

        "Title": "Could Buying Amazon Stock Today Set You Up for Life?",
        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's generally wise for investors to opt for the slow-and-steady road to wealth. It's easier to get on base than to hit a home run, and steady success can create magical financial outcomes if you give it time. But that doesn't mean you can't occasionally aim for the stars; the right stock can set you up for life.\nSometimes, it's better to be lucky than good.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is arguably the most famous example. If you had invested just $1,000 in the stock in the late 1990s, you'd have over $1.8 million today.\nThe company is a juggernaut now, worth almost $2 trillion. It's no longer the lottery-ticket stock it once was, but don't underestimate its ability to create life-changing wealth for long-term investors. Here is why Amazon can still make you generationally wealthy.\nAmazon's roots are in e-commerce, where its Prime membership has become famous. There are an estimated 167 million Prime subscribers in the United States. With an estimated 129 million total households in America, it's safe to say that most people who shop online subscribe to Prime. After all, Amazon dominates U.S. online shopping with approximately 40% market share.\nPrime started with e-commerce perks like free shipping, but the membership expanded as Amazon built out its business. Today, Amazon is in several consumer-facing business segments, including media, streaming, and healthcare. The more value Amazon adds to Prime, the stickier it becomes with customers, and the more Amazon can charge for it. It helps Amazon grow new products or services, and generates roughly $40 billion in recurring revenue at its size today.\nAmazon has leaned into live sports to bolster its advertising business, scooping up rights to broadcast National Basketball Association and Women's National Basketball Association games starting in 2025. This adds to Amazon's existing National Football League rights. Live sports are a huge draw, strengthening Prime's appeal. I wouldn't be surprised to see Amazon continue expanding Prime into new industries.\nIt's hard to discuss Amazon without talking about Amazon Web Services, the cloud platform it launched in 2006 that has grown to become its leading source of profits. Amazon won in e-commerce because it consolidated the retail business model and used its massive size to offer superior service and price. Cloud is playing out similarly. Amazon amassed an enormous computing system housed in data centers. It rents out its computing capacity to customers, offering better performance for less money than it would cost companies to build and maintain their own.\nBut there are millions of businesses worldwide, so widespread cloud migration takes time. That's why AWS and other cloud platforms have grown for over a decade, and it's not over yet. Estimates from Mordor Intelligence estimate that the global cloud computing market was worth $587 billion last year and will grow by an average of 16.5%, reaching $2.29 trillion in 2032.\nAmazon is the global leader with an estimated 31% market share, so it will benefit directly as the total \"pie\" grows. A mid-teens growth rate is impressive, so barring a collapse, I don't see why cloud can't grow comfortably for at least another decade. Artificial intelligence (AI) may add more upside than is currently known.\nTo this point, I've highlighted Amazon's still-growing core businesses and the potential addition of emerging opportunities within Prime. It's time to put some numbers on this.\nToday, analysts estimate that Amazon will grow earnings by an average of almost 28% annually for the next three to five years. For the record, shares trade at 38 times Amazon's estimated 2024 earnings. If Amazon comes anywhere near those estimates, it's hard not to like the stock at this price.\nIt only gets better if you plan on holding the stock for a long time (five years or more), because growth trends like e-commerce and the cloud seem poised to grow well beyond the next five years, which implies that Amazon should put up strong earnings growth for years to come. It's unlikely a business growing earnings at almost 30% annually will fall off a cliff. I could see earnings growth slowing over the years due to the company's sheer size, but it should still create tremendous long-term investment results, given its high growth rate today.\nAmazon is a world-class company, and its constant push to expand and grow has created a monster that can still help set investors up for life over the next decade and beyond.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Author": "  Affan Mir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Invest In.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other profitable blue chip stocks.\nThe September inflation report came in hotter than expected and showed that it remains sticky. Headline inflation rose by 2.4%, slightly above the anticipated 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. Month-over-month, CPI increased by 0.2%, exceeding the forecast of 0.1%.\nCore inflation, excluding food and energy, also came in higher than expected at 3.3%, compared to the anticipated 3.2%, marking a slight increase from August. On a monthly basis, core CPI rose by 0.3%, which matched August\u2019s figures but was above expectations of 0.2%.\nFollowing the report, the market is expecting a 25 basis points rate cut to no rate cuts in the upcoming Fed meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 79.9% of interest rate traders expect the rate cuts to be at 450-475 bps at the coming Fed meeting while 20.1% expect the rate cut to stay the same. At the beginning of the month, 32.1% expected a 50 bps rate cut, while 67.9% anticipated a 25 bps cut.\nDespite the sticky inflation, IBM's vice chair, Gary Cohn believes that the Fed will cut rates by 100 bps this year. In an interview at CNBC's \u2018Money Movers',\u00a0he suggested that the U.S. is experiencing what a soft landing looks like, with inflation decreasing but not steadily. He indicated that reaching the Fed's 2% target will be challenging, as inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around this level.\nCohn noted that for the first time in nearly two decades, the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate, employment, and price stability, after focusing primarily on one at a time. He believes the Fed is making the right decisions and is currently in a delicate position as it missed meeting opportunities this year.\nCohn expects that the Fed will implement a total of 100 basis points in rate cuts this year, likely consisting of 25 basis point reductions over the next couple of months. When asked about inflation targets, he expressed a preference for slightly exceeding the target inflation rate, suggesting that a rate of around 2.2% would be more acceptable in a growing economy than undershooting the target.\nCohn also highlighted concerns about geopolitical risks and said that global tensions could lead to inflationary pressures by disrupting supply chains and increasing shipping costs.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we use stock screeners to identify nearly 30 stocks above $100 billion market cap and $10 billion TTM net income. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks that had a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate of above 10% and were most widely held by institutional investors. The most profitable blue chip stocks are listed in ascending order of the hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 database of 912 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nMarket Cap: $1.937 Trillion\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 29.71%\nTTM Net Income: $44.42 billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the biggest technology and e-commerce companies in the world. Its operations span e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence industries. The company tops our list of most profitable blue chip stocks.\nIts operations are divided into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). For consumers, the company offers a wide selection of products through online and physical stores and emphasizes low prices, fast delivery, and customer service.\nOne of Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) significant projects is Kuiper Systems LLC, also known as Project Kuiper. It is a subsidiary of the company founded in 2019 and provides global broadband internet through a satellite constellation in low Earth orbit. The company has invested a substantial amount of money in the project to make it an important player in satellite-based internet services.\nOn October 10, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated a Buy rating for the company stock due to the firm\u2019s confidence in Project Kuiper. Although Kuiper's costs, including launch expenses, hardware, and R&D, are complex, the analyst views the financial impact as manageable.\nHe acknowledged the project's delays but believes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) can absorb the estimated $1.5 billion EBIT hit in 2025, which is minimal compared to its projected $75-$80 billion EBIT. Nowak remains optimistic about the company\u2019s financial strength and ability to handle the timing of cost recognition.\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon\u2019s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the most profitable blue chip stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The bull run has seen the market continue to rise to new record highs, supporting revenue and earnings growth across the board.\nFast forward, the upward momentum appears to have peaked, with market indices at record highs. While it was highly expected that stocks would explode on the Federal Reserve offering support to a struggling economy with interest rate cuts, that has not been the case.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy\u00a0and\u00a07 Best Nanotech Penny Stocks to Buy.\nIt\u2019s become increasingly clear that investors have become more sensitive to growth scares as the global economy faces many issues. Top on the list is the rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that threaten to disrupt supply chain networks. Energy prices rising owing to the escalation of a full-blown war could trigger higher inflation, something that is unsettling the markets.\nAnalysts at UBS are already warning investors that they should get overweight on defensive names as global growth slows at the back of deteriorating fundamentals. While UBS doesn\u2019t anticipate a severe downturn, the bank is cautious, advising its clients to focus on important sectors like utilities and pharmaceuticals, which always outperform in a downturn.\nWhile investors are increasingly rotating into defensive plays amid concerns about geopolitical tensions and the slowing global economy, Morgan Stanley Investment Management\u2019s Andrew Slimmon recommends against this strategy.\n\u201cNow is the time to just be cautious. Don\u2019t chase the defensives that are working because I think when we get to the fourth quarter, that won\u2019t work,\u201d the portfolio manager told CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Exchange.\n\u201cWhile our expectation is for October to remain choppy, we don\u2019t view the overall market action to be bearish and encourage investors to maintain perspective on the longer-term trends,\u201d Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, wrote to clients.\nThe sentiments echo the need to focus on high-growth companies. Investors who diversify their portfolio into high-growth companies eventually earn great returns regardless of how much a stock rises or falls in the short term.\nAnalysts project that S&P 500 stocks will grow at a median annual EPS rate of 8.5% over the next five years. On the other hand, the best growth stocks are well poised to outperform this benchmark by a factor of two to three or more.\nFor starters, companies exposed to artificial intelligence spectacles or those leveraging technology continue to deliver record earnings and revenue growth, thus dominating most hedge fund portfolios. Additionally, the most promising growth stocks, according to hedge funds, are those whose core business would be positively impacted by improving consumer purchasing power. As the Fed steers the economy into a soft landing, consumer purchasing is expected to improve, benefiting consumer cyclical stocks. Moreover, the rate cuts will likely benefit growth and tech stocks as well.\nMarket fluctuations are inevitable, but the secret to a growth stock\u2019s success lies in the robustness of its core operations. Regardless of whether a stock is rising or falling in the short term, if you consistently invest in a competitively solid business, you\u2019ll eventually reap substantial rewards.\nPixabay/ Public Domain\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to find 30 popular growth stocks. Then we selected the 10 that were the most widely held by hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has often been perceived as a technology investment play, given its investment in various tech solutions to strengthen its edge in multiple sectors. Nevertheless, it stands out as one of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds for diversifying an investment portfolio in the consumer cyclical sector.\nWith the recent interest rate cuts expected to bolster consumer purchasing power, Amazon should be one of the biggest beneficiaries as customers flocking its e-commerce platform.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s long-term prospects lie in the digital marketplace as the Prime program gains widespread recognition. The more benefits Amazon offers through Prime, the more loyal its customers become, allowing it to increase its pricing and thus generate more revenue.\nLikewise, the company emerged successful in the online shopping sector by integrating the retail business framework and leveraging its vast scale to provide outstanding service and competitive pricing. This strategy is being replicated in the cloud industry, where it commands a 31% market share.\nWhile the company generates most of its revenue from the online marketplace, it reaps most profits from its cloud unit, which is billed as the world\u2019s largest cloud infrastructure. AWS operates at much higher margins, thus subsidizing the growth of Amazon\u2019s lower-margin e-commerce business.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has also sought to diversify its revenue stream by advertising live sports and acquiring the rights to air National Basketball Association and Women\u2019s National Basketball Association games beginning in 2025.\nAnalysts expect Amazon\u2019s earnings to grow by nearly 28% yearly over the next three to five years, justifying the stock trading at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 30. Additionally, analysts rate the stock as a buy with an average price target of $223.43, implying a 21.77% upside potential. Based on our Insider Monkey database, by the end of Q2 2024, 308 hedge funds had invested in AMZN, with their total stakes reaching $65.85 billion.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\u201d\nOverall AMZN\u00a0ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds.

        "Text": "We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. In this piece, we will look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the list of Goldman Sachs' Phase 2 AI stocks.\nWhile consumer technology stocks had soared in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, back then, their share price gains were due to. the growing demand for technology products and services due to lock downs. Now, big technology stocks have persisted in their strong performance despite high interest rates since they have been judged by the market as the top innovators and performers in the artificial intelligence industry.\nSince AI is somewhat of a ubiquitous technology, its impact is on several industries. So far, we\u2019ve seen most of the stock market returns related to AI directly tied to just one stock. This stock continued to be the fifth most trending AI stocks as recently as in mid October and its share price returns are nothing short of unbelievable. From its bottom in October 2022 when the split adjusted share price was a mere $11.23, the shares have gained a stunning 1,100%. In other words, if you had invested just $100 back then in the shares and then held onto them for dear life, your investment would be worth $1,200 today.\nThis is the magic of AI, a technology that has caught Wall Street and retail investors alike by storm. However, AI\u2019s impact, and its enablement, aren\u2019t limited to the GPU designer we\u2019ve mentioned above. While GPUs are the \u2018oil\u2019 for this technology, a wide variety of other components from data center infrastructure, networking equipment, connectivity, and energy all will have to play their part if OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s plans of initially building as many as 7 AI data centers across the US, with each data center guzzling an unbelievable 5 Gigawatts of electricity, are to come to fruition.\nThis then makes us ask, what are such stocks that might enable 35 Gigawatts of AI data centers across the US? After all, in order to meet the world\u2019s demand for AI chips, Altman believes that an unfathomable $7 trillion will need to be spent for building 36 chip manufacturing fabs and additional AI data centers. This money has to be spent somewhere, and therein lies the answer to our question. Things get clearer when we look at a detailed research report from investment bank Goldman Sachs. This report segregated the AI sector into four categories.\nThe first category only included Wall Street\u2019s AI darling, the second was made of AI capacity providers like server companies, other semiconductor firms, and utilities, the third included firms that sell AI products and software, and the fourth category firms were those that will benefit from AI adoption. In its report, the investment bank shared that year to date in July, the first category had returned 139%. As of mid October, this category has gained 179% on the stock market, so safe to say returns have accelerated despite some turbulence in between. By July, the second group of firms was also doing well. Its returns ranged between ~-8% to ~50%, with the average stock having delivered 22%.\nZooming into these firms, the utility sector is one which had particularly impressed the bank. It shared that utilities were the best performing sector in the flagship S&P index between March and May courtesy of their 16% returns. Their three month returns ranked in the 98th percentile since 2022 and were the third highest after 2003 and 2020 rallies. This outperformance is unsurprising given the strong investments in data centers that have taken the US by storm this year.\nThese investments have led to estimates suggesting that America\u2019s data center hub, Northern Virginia, will require 11,000 megawatts of electricity by 2035 \u2013 demand which has already spurred $5.2 billion in investments for transmission lines and coal fired power plants. Estimates from Boston Consulting Group believe that by 2030, AI will account for 16% of America\u2019s energy consumption and touch 130 gigawatts. For a detailed look at the link between electricity use and data centers, you should read 15 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Jefferies, Citi and Wall Street Analysts.\nThe bustling optimism surrounding AI is also reflected in revenue estimates. Goldman\u2019s September 2024 research shows that 2025 revenue estimates of semiconductor firms, software enablers, and hardware firms except semiconductors are roughly 2.3x, 2.05x, and 1.8x over 2019 levels, respectively. Similarly, non semiconductor hardware companies have seen their revenue forecasts for Q4 2025 jump to $450 billion for a $380 billion gain over Q1 2024\u2019s $70 billion. Makes us wonder whether it\u2019s this group of companies that might see a stock mirror the 1,100% returns of Wall Street\u2019s AI darling.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 best phase 2 AI stocks, we ranked the 20 stocks with the highest year to date returns and some other big tech and data center names that have announced multi billion dollars in capital expenditure by their year to date performance.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA close up of a confident investor making a decisive transaction in the stock market.\nYear To Date Share Price Gain: 25.94%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s largest eCommerce company and a dominant player in the cloud computing industry. This offers it an unmatched business diversification, with the eCommerce business providing high volume top line contributions and the cloud business offering a high margin business with stable revenues. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s partnership with Anthropic, a firm set up by former OpenAI employees, has provided it with access to a foundational AI model. When coupled with its in house processors and data center infrastructure, it makes Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) one of the few firms in the world to provide an end to end AI stack to businesses and other users. The firm\u2019s AI software also allows it to improve merchant advertising on its eCommerce site and become an AI beneficiary. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s tools such as Amazon Bedrock provide generative AI for application development and enable broader AI access in the industry.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cAmazon.com Inc. (AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 22nd on our list of Goldman Sachs' top phase 2 AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

While GPUs are the \u2018oil\u2019 for this technology, a wide variety of other components from data center infrastructure, networking equipment, connectivity, and energy all will have to play their part if OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s plans of initially building as many as 7 AI data centers across the US, with each data center guzzling an unbelievable 5 Gigawatts of electricity, are to come to fruition.\nThis then makes us ask, what are such stocks that might enable 35 Gigawatts of AI data centers across the US? After all, in order to meet the world\u2019s demand for AI chips, Altman believes that an unfathomable $7 trillion will need to be spent for building 36 chip manufacturing fabs and additional AI data centers. This money has to be spent somewhere, and therein lies the answer to our question. Things get clearer when we look at a detailed research report from investment bank Goldman Sachs. This report segregated the AI sector into four categories.\nThe first category only included Wall Street\u2019s AI darling, the second was made of AI capacity providers like server companies, other semiconductor firms, and utilities, the third included firms that sell AI products and software, and the fourth category firms were those that will benefit from AI adoption. In its report, the investment bank shared that year to date in July, the first category had returned 139%. As of mid October, this category has gained 179% on the stock market, so safe to say returns have accelerated despite some turbulence in between. By July, the second group of firms was also doing well. Its returns ranged between ~-8% to ~50%, with the average stock having delivered 22%.\nZooming into these firms, the utility sector is one which had particularly impressed the bank. It shared that utilities were the best performing sector in the flagship S&P index between March and May courtesy of their 16% returns. Their three month returns ranked in the 98th percentile since 2022 and were the third highest after 2003 and 2020 rallies. This outperformance is unsurprising given the strong investments in data centers that have taken the US by storm this year.\nThese investments have led to estimates suggesting that America\u2019s data center hub, Northern Virginia, will require 11,000 megawatts of electricity by 2035 \u2013 demand which has already spurred $5.2 billion in investments for transmission lines and coal fired power plants. Estimates from Boston Consulting Group believe that by 2030, AI will account for 16% of America\u2019s energy consumption and touch 130 gigawatts. For a detailed look at the link between electricity use and data centers, you should read 15 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Jefferies, Citi and Wall Street Analysts.\nThe bustling optimism surrounding AI is also reflected in revenue estimates. Goldman\u2019s September 2024 research shows that 2025 revenue estimates of semiconductor firms, software enablers, and hardware firms except semiconductors are roughly 2.3x, 2.05x, and 1.8x over 2019 levels, respectively. Similarly, non semiconductor hardware companies have seen their revenue forecasts for Q4 2025 jump to $450 billion for a $380 billion gain over Q1 2024\u2019s $70 billion. Makes us wonder whether it\u2019s this group of companies that might see a stock mirror the 1,100% returns of Wall Street\u2019s AI darling.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 best phase 2 AI stocks, we ranked the 20 stocks with the highest year to date returns and some other big tech and data center names that have announced multi billion dollars in capital expenditure by their year to date performance.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA close up of a confident investor making a decisive transaction in the stock market.\nYear To Date Share Price Gain: 25.94%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s largest eCommerce company and a dominant player in the cloud computing industry. This offers it an unmatched business diversification, with the eCommerce business providing high volume top line contributions and the cloud business offering a high margin business with stable revenues. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s partnership with Anthropic, a firm set up by former OpenAI employees, has provided it with access to a foundational AI model. When coupled with its in house processors and data center infrastructure, it makes Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) one of the few firms in the world to provide an end to end AI stack to businesses and other users. The firm\u2019s AI software also allows it to improve merchant advertising on its eCommerce site and become an AI beneficiary. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s tools such as Amazon Bedrock provide generative AI for application development and enable broader AI access in the industry.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cAmazon.com Inc. (AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 22nd on our list of Goldman Sachs' top phase 2 AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Is Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) the Best Quality Stock to Buy According to Analysts?",
        "Author": "  Maham Fatima ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Quality Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we will look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the best-quality stocks to buy.\nThe stock market has seen a notable 20% increase year-to-date, but as it approaches the seasonally volatile months leading up to Election Day, potential volatility is expected. The S&P 500 has historically pulled back 5% to 10% around election time but tends to recover afterward.\nInstead of cashing out, investors are encouraged to take advantage of any market pullbacks. Historically, when the Fed cuts rates without an impending recession, it creates a favorable environment for broader market performance. Mona Mahajan, Edward Jones senior investment strategist, recently appeared on CNBC to discuss her similar sentiment on these latest market trends, and where investors can find opportunities right now. We talked about this in our article about the\u00a010 Best WallStreetBets Stocks To Buy Right Now, here\u2019s an excerpt from it:\n\u201cWhen asked if investors should consider cashing out and taking a holiday for the remainder of the year, Mahajan advised against such a move. Instead, she suggested that if there are pullbacks or corrections in the market, it would be prudent to lean into those opportunities\u2026 Additionally, rate cuts typically lead to expanded valuations, particularly for sectors that have lagged behind in this regard. She emphasized that lower borrowing costs from Fed rate cuts would benefit both consumers and corporations. In terms of investment strategies during potential downturns, she recommended focusing on cyclical sectors such as utilities and industrials while also maintaining exposure to technology and the artificial intelligence sectors. Mahajan underscored that diversification would be key over the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d\nGlobal Investment Strategist at ProShares Advisors, Simeon Hyman, appeared on CNBC on October 2 to emphasize \u2018income\u2019 as a key focus, highlighting the opportunity in fixed-income markets, which could provide 10-15% returns if geopolitical tensions worsen. He thinks that the US economy is stronger than the rest of the world despite tensions.\nSimeon Hyman emphasized the importance of the term \u2018income\u2019 in the context of current market conditions, noting that the market was just 1% off its all-time highs. This situation presents a salary cut for income-oriented investors, highlighting the challenges they face. However, the fixed-income market offers a silver lining; it currently provides enough yield to cushion against worsening geopolitical tensions. For instance, the yield on the 10-year bond is nearly 4%, and there is potential for it to drop to 3% or lower if significant negative events occur. This scenario presents an opportunity for investors to realize gains of 10% or 15% on bonds in a tumultuous environment, a situation not seen in over a decade.\nDespite the current market being down by 3.7%, which is slightly less than 4%, Hyman insisted that rounding was at play. He expressed surprise at this performance given ongoing geopolitical tensions but pointed out that positive economic news in the US persists. Specifically, there has been a 50-basis point cut and indications of a soft landing for the economy. A month-over-month increase of just 0.1% suggests that if one can overlook geopolitical issues, the US economy is faring better than many others globally and remains on solid economic footing.\nAdditionally, Hyman proposed a covered call strategy focused on the Russell 2000 index, which has been underperforming compared to the S&P 500. He described this strategy as beneficial because it allows investors to generate income that could offset recent losses while maintaining a bullish position in small caps. Historically, rate cuts have positively impacted small-cap stocks, and this strategy enables investors to capitalize on that trend while also generating income through covered calls.\nFor risk-averse investors, the current emphasis on fixed-income markets as a viable investment option aligns well with the insights shared by Simeon Hyman, who highlighted the potential for 10-15% returns in bonds amid geopolitical tensions. Additionally, they may also explore quality stocks with reliable growth histories, which can provide stability in uncertain market conditions, similar to the defensive strategies Hyman suggested.\nMethodology\nTo compile our list, we first sifted through Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF holdings to find the ones with an upside potential of over 15% as of October 4, 2024. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their analysts\u2019 upside potential.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAverage Upside Potential: 20.91%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is engaged in e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. It\u2019s the world\u2019s largest online marketplace, offering a vast selection of products across various categories. It also provides cloud computing services through AWS, streaming services like Prime Video and Music, and hardware products like Kindle and Echo.\nAWS, its most profitable part, has over 30% profit margins and is expected to grow by 15% to 21% each year until 2028, so its success is important for the company\u2019s future profits. AWS grew by 18.8% in Q2 2024. Amazon Prime has become very successful, with 200 million members worldwide. It helps customers spend more and is almost $100 billion per year.\nThe company is making money from ads on its content. The ad business is now worth $50 billion, after AWS. Evercore ISI thinks Amazon Prime Video could make between $1.8 and $3.3 billion in profit by 2025, which could increase its total profit by 3% to 5% this year.\nPhysical stores, like Whole Foods, are the smallest part of Amazon\u2019s business and aren\u2019t growing very fast. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has invested $30.5 billion in capital expenditures this year and expects more spending in the second half. This is driven by growing AI demand. Investors are confident in its future, especially AWS, which has a $156.6 billion backlog and improved profitability to over 30%. These factors add up to make it a great investment opportunity.\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon\u2019s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 7th on our list of the best-quality stocks. While we acknowledge the growth potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "On Tuesday morning, Panos Panay didn\u2019t look like a man under intense pressure. Or maybe he\u2019s just good at hiding it.\nPanay, the former chief product officer of Microsoft, joined Amazon last October as the head of its gadgets and services division, including Alexa. As a result, his most pressing task since day one has been to help lead a reinvention of the 10-year-old voice assistant for the new generative AI age.\nOne year later, though, and neither Panay nor any other Amazon executive has yet revealed the new Alexa to the public. Fortune previously reported that the new Alexa initiative, first announced by Panay\u2019s predecessor, Dave Limp, last September, has been beset by both internal structural and technological hurdles. Multiple news reports have suggested that Amazon would finally unveil it this fall.\nBut rather than a big AI reveal, Panos stood in front of a room full of journalists on Tuesday to unveil a slate of new devices from a product line where Amazon can feel comfortable: Kindle. He revealed four Kindles in total\u2014ranging in price from $109.99 for the latest original Kindle, now available in Matcha, up to $399.99 for the latest Kindle Scribe. He also showed off the first color e-reader in the family, dubbed Kindle Colorsoft, which is available for preorder and will run $279.99.\nWhile the humble Kindle e-reader might not seem as sexy to technologists as a forthcoming AI-boosted Alexa, Panos at times seemed personally smitten with his team\u2019s new creations, using the descriptor \u201cromantic\u201d frequently throughout his roughly 40-minute talk.\nOf the original Kindle\u2019s size, he remarked: \u201cMaybe the most romantic thing about this \u2026 product is you can put it in your pocket.\u201d\nThe video introducing the Colorsoft was also \u201cromantic.\u201d As was the \u201cquite romantic\u201d setting of the press event\u2014a salon-style space on the eighth floor of New York City\u2019s the Shed art center, drenched in natural light thanks to a high glass ceiling.\nWhether or not some of Panay\u2019s emotion was more performance-driven than organic, it was refreshing both because it was not typically Amazonian\u2014and maybe that\u2019s the point for a division that could use reinvigorating\u2014and because it occurred at a press event in which the current industry infatuation with gen AI was largely absent.\nIn fact, the only AI references arose when Panay discussed the new Kindle Scribe, which sports artificial intelligence that works in the background to summarize a user\u2019s notes, and to make one\u2019s writing more legible or neater if they so choose. Panay later told Fortune that he and his teams whittled down a list of more than 50 AI-powered feature ideas to this final pair.\n\u201cThe point of gen AI is not to have gen AI,\u201d he said in a short interview after his presentation. \u201cThe point is to make it useful.\u201d\nAnd that is the dilemma Panay and the teams working on a new AI-powered Alexa have been facing since at least last year: How do you re-architect and reimagine the company\u2019s decade-old voice assistant using gen AI in a way that is truly differentiated and useful?\nWhile tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity AI have captured the minds of technologists and everyday consumers worldwide, Alexa has, at least publicly, been standing still. What those other tools provide in usefulness, though, they can lack in emotional connection. Whether large swaths of humanity desire that from artificial beings remains to be seen, but there\u2019s an opening there for Amazon, Alexa, and Panay.\nI was curious what Panay thought of that idea. He had just spent considerable time expressing to reporters the emotional impact of Kindle features like faster page-flips or the right vibration of a digital pen against a Kindle\u2019s screen.\nShould we expect the new Alexa to elicit such a personal response in him and others, too, especially when recent versions of the voice assistant have at times strayed toward desperate nudging?\n\u201cI mean, you\u2019re definitely going to hear me talk about emotion,\u201d Panay told Fortune exclusively about the forthcoming Alexa release. \u201cAnd connection. People have an interesting relationship with Alexa. There\u2019s hundreds of millions of people that do right now. So you have to get it right.\u201d\n\u201cThe products coming,\u201d he added, \u201care pretty awesome.\u201d\nAre you a current or former Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Chewy (NYSE: CHWY) represent two different ways to invest in the e-commerce sector. Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce company and Chewy operates a smaller online marketplace for pet products.\nChewy was spun off from PetSmart and went public in 2019, but it's only risen 36% from its IPO price of $22 and trades 75% below its all-time high. Amazon's stock has rallied 118% over the past five years and is hovering close to its record high. Let's see if the e-commerce leader will continue to outperform the niche underdog as a long-term investment.\nAmazon is a larger and more diversified company than Chewy. Amazon initially only operated a first-party marketplace, but it subsequently launched a higher-margin third-party marketplace. It also acquired Whole Foods Market in 2017.\nAmazon generates most of its revenue from its retail business, which operates in 22 countries and ships to more than 100 countries. It also locks more than 200 million members into its sticky Prime subscriptions -- which provide free shipping options, exclusive discounts, streaming media services, and other perks.\nAmazon generates most of its profits from Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world's largest cloud infrastructure platform, and its smaller advertising unit. Those higher-margin businesses subsidize the expansion of its lower-margin retail business.\nChewy operates a third-party marketplace generating most of its revenue in the U.S., but kicked off its international expansion by entering Canada last year. The company served just over 20 million active customers at the end of its latest quarter.\nChewy mainly sells pet food and pet products, and it locks in its customers with free Autoship subscriptions that provide discounts for recurring scheduled orders. Its Autoship orders generated 78% of its total revenue in the first half of 2024.\nChewy faces a lot of competition from superstores like Walmart, e-commerce giants like Amazon, and even its former parent company PetSmart. To widen its moat and boost its margins, Chewy has been launching more private label products, expanding its own pet health insurance plans, and selling more digital ads across its marketplace.\nFrom 2019 to 2023, Amazon's net sales grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20%. From fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 (which ended in January), Chewy's net sales rose at a slightly faster CAGR of 23%.\nBut Chewy's growth decelerated over the past three years as it failed to gain new active customers, and its net sales only rose 10% in fiscal 2023. Analysts expect its net sales to grow at an even slower CAGR of 6% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026.\nChewy is trying to offset the lack of fresh customer growth by growing revenue per customer with its Autoship subscriptions, insurance plans, and ads -- but it's clearly running out of room to grow. On the bright side, analysts expect its earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 100% during those three years as it reins in its spending and buys back shares.\nAmazon suffered a slowdown in 2022 as its retail business lapped its pandemic-driven growth spurt and faced fresh inflationary headwinds for consumer spending. But the company reversed that deceleration in 2023 with 12% net sales growth as those headwinds dissipated and the macro environment stabilized. From 2023 to 2026, analysts expect its revenue to rise at a CAGR of 11% as its EPS increases at a CAGR of 36%.\nThat growth should be driven by expansion of its marketplace into new overseas markets and robust AI tailwinds for AWS' cloud computing business. A warmer macro environment could also spur more ad purchases across its platforms.\nOn a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, Chewy and Amazon trade at 34 times and 40 times this year's earnings, respectively. Amazon's stock might look pricier than Chewy's, but Amazon's business is also much larger, growing faster, better diversified, and has a wider moat. That's why I believe Amazon will still outperform Chewy for the foreseeable future.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Maleha Afzal ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Stocks to Buy for Long Term.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks.\nOn September 23, Chris Watling, Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the rate easing path and the impact it may have on the market.\nAccording to Walting, the market is deeply divided on not two but three different sides. While some analysts and investors foresee a recession, others believe the economy is going towards a soft landing, and of those a small minority believe that the economy may accelerate at a rapid pace. Walting also added that while predicting the appropriate terminal rate is interesting, there is a lot more going on with the economy. Comparing economic conditions to the 2008 recession, households and corporations are in much better shape, hinting that a recession may not be the most likely outcome.\nHe believes that the economy may be slowing right now but it may experience faster reacceleration than before without the need for further falls. His advice to investors is to judge the economy based on multiple data points. As for the appropriate portfolio, Walting suggests that bonds are overcooked and gold must be given a pause. At the moment, the market is rotating away from tech into defensive sectors, and in the future, it may rotate more towards cyclical stocks.\nAs the S&P 500 recorded an upside following the Fed's easing cycle, investors and analysts alike eye a soft landing for the economy. On September 26, Liz Miller, Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the future of markets.\nMiller states that the pivot has been great for the financial markets and now that the Fed is thinking about growth, investors are hopeful of a soft landing. She suggests that stocks in sectors such as housing, rental, finance, and consumer goods may benefit immensely from the easing interest rate cycle.\nMiller suggests that the S&P 500 is not the best way to measure the performance of financial markets, given that it is skewed to the mega-cap tech stocks. Looking at other indices, other sectors have not made highs since December 2021. She believes the market may be flat but there is huge potential for upsides. Miller shares concerns over the Chinese economy and how it influences the global outlook. She suggests that for the global economy to balance, companies must work to regain consumer confidence in China.\nNow that we have studied the appropriate portfolio mix for investors following the Fed's decision, let's take a look at the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nTo come up with the 7 best stocks to buy for the long term we examined promising stocks hedge funds are piling into. These are blue chip stocks with wide moats and have long track records of driving shareholder returns. We have ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services. Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services, on the other hand, is used by millions of active customers and has over 130,000 AWS partners across 200 countries.\nThe company is on track to capture over 40% of the e-commerce market in the United States. As for its cloud segment, AWS has logged 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters, making it a star performer.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also making strides on the AI front. Over the past few months, the company has partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models. As for AI hardware, the company has produced several AI chips to reduce its dependence on other companies. Speaking of AI, AWS is now housing the next generation of Llama models from Meta, giving customers more choices to build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications. The new models are capable of visual reasoning, document processing, and multilingual translation.\nAmazon\u2019s growth is undeniable which explains its position on our list. Analysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 17% upside from current levels. Overall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds and Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder, according to the Insider Monkey database.\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon\u2019s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.\"\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "5 Brilliant Reasons Why Amazon Will Crush the Market",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market, no matter which timeframe you look at. It has risen 47% over the past year, 115% in the last five years, and 1,060% in the past decade -- easily outperforming the market (measured by the S&P 500) over that timeframe. But none of that matters now, as you can't travel back in time to invest in Amazon earlier.\nAll that remains is the future, and determining whether a stock can beat the market moving forward is a tricky proposition. However, I've come up with five reasons why Amazon can, making it an intriguing investment opportunity.\nWhen you think of Amazon, the first thing that comes to mind is its online store, which has nearly anything you can think of. However, Amazon is a much broader business. Whether it's cloud computing, advertising, or fulfillment, Amazon is an incredibly complex company involved in many areas.\nDespite the rise of other areas, its commerce business is still the largest part of its business. This is a fairly mature segment, so improving margins is a must. Amazon has been doing just that, with its North American business delivering a 5.6% operating margin in the second quarter\u00a0versus 3.9% in last year's Q2. While that may not sound like a massive improvement, it caused operating income to rise 58% year over year.\nOn the international side, Amazon posted a $273 million operating profit versus an $895 million loss last year. The international business hasn't steadily made a profit, but it will greatly boost Amazon's profit picture once it does.\nAccording to CEO Andy Jassy, there's still work to be done. But if Amazon can continue improving its margin across its commerce businesses, it will help propel Amazon to new heights.\nWithin Amazon's commerce division are advertising services, which are one of Amazon's fastest-growing segments. While investors don't know what its profit contribution is (hint: it's likely a lot), it has shown tremendous growth, posting year-over-year growth of at least 20% since Q1 2023.\nAdvertising is a known high-margin business (just look at Meta Platforms), so any outsize growth in this segment should help boost Amazon's overall commerce margins.\u00a0If advertising can deliver strong growth in the future, it will be a key factor in helping Amazon outperform the market.\nAnother part of Amazon is its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS has been an absolute cash cow for Amazon and has recently returned to growth mode due to new artificial intelligence (AI) workloads coming online.\nAWS puts Amazon's commerce business to shame, posting 19% revenue growth in Q2 with an operating margin of 36%. It's critical that AWS continues to post strong quarters, as its growth helps fuel Amazon's profit growth in an outsize way. AI will significantly help AWS's growth case, which is paramount for maintaining its status as a strong stock.\nAs alluded to above, AWS makes up a huge chunk of Amazon's profits. In Q2, AWS accounted for 64% of Amazon's total operating income. This means that if AWS grows profits at a faster pace than the rest of the company, Amazon's profits will also rise at a quicker pace.\nSome investors ignore this key factor, thinking Amazon is just a mature commerce business that can't get any bigger. Cloud computing is far from that, and AWS is set to benefit.\nMordor Intelligence projects that the cloud computing market opportunity will increase from $680 billion today to $1.44 trillion by 2029 -- a 16.4% compound annual growth rate. That massive growth is what AWS is primed to cash in on and will help Amazon become a market-crushing stock.\nThanks to management's focus on efficiency, Amazon is now producing record free-cash-flow (FCF) levels.\nGenerating massive amounts of cash is the hallmark of a great business, as it can be used to reward shareholders through share repurchases, dividends, or debt repayment. It also adds to Amazon's cash hoard, which allows the company to pursue investment opportunities it thinks could become the next big thing.\nAmazon has already proven its ability to build meaningful ancillary businesses with the integration of its delivery network, advertising services, and AWS. I don't know what Amazon's next big hit is, but it's likely already in development.\nAmazon has a strong business and is expected to continue its dominance in the years ahead. These factors combine to make a stock that's slated to outperform the market, and I'm a buyer as a result.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.97% for the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.3%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 1.45%.\nHeading into today, shares of the online retailer had gained 3.08% over the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 7.36% and the S&P 500's gain of 5.41% in that time.\nThe upcoming earnings release of Amazon will be of great interest to investors. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.14, up 34.12% from the prior-year quarter. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $157.05 billion, up 9.76% from the year-ago period.\nAMZN's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.74 per share and revenue of $634.38 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +63.45% and +10.37%, respectively.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends.

At present, Amazon boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nDigging into valuation, Amazon currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 38.12.

        "Text": "Amazon AMZN has experienced a 44% rally in its share price in the past year, outperforming the industry\u2019s rise of 39.8% and the S&P 500 index\u2019s return of 33.7%.The company has been riding on solid momentum in its cloud computing arm \u2014 Amazon Web Services, which is being driven by strength in Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is continuously making strides in the Generative AI (GenAI) technology, which has now become mainstream in the cloud industry.\u00a0Amazon has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, integrating GenAI capabilities across its AWS product suite. Growing AI capabilities have positioned AMZN as a leader in the cloud market.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nDespite being the dominant player in the cloud market, the company faces strong competition from cloud giants like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google, which are also making concerted efforts to power their cloud solutions with GenAI.This raises a crucial question of whether Amazon\u2019s AI advancements will drive the momentum in its share price amid stiff GenAI and cloud competition.\nAWS is gaining significantly from the solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.The company\u2019s introduction of Bedrock innovations, including custom model import and model evaluation capabilities and Guardrails, is a positive. These features are designed to provide customers with a secure, easy and fast way to develop advanced generative AI applications.With a wide selection of foundation models from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI and Stability AI, Bedrock offers seamless deployment, scalability and continuous optimization.AWS also offers a generative AI-powered assistant called Amazon Q, which generates codes, tests and debugs, and has multi-step planning and reasoning capabilities.The company\u2019s collaboration with NVIDIA, through which it will make the latter\u2019s Blackwell GPU platform available on AWS, is a plus. This will help speed up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion-parameter language models.Amazon recently unveiled a GenAI-powered service called AWS App Studio, which helps create enterprise-grade applications by leveraging natural language. It simplifies and fastens the process of developing an application from scratch.AWS partnered with Intel INTC to enhance its AI capabilities. Per the terms, Intel will produce an AI fabric chip for AWS based on its most advanced process node, Intel 18A. It will also make a custom Xeon 6 chip on Intel 3 for AWS.\nAWS is witnessing solid customer momentum on the back of its strengthening AI and GenAI capabilities.Recently, Digital Domain partnered with AWS to scale its Autonomous Virtual Human Technology and introduce GenAI-powered features by leveraging the latter\u2019s cloud infrastructure, GenAI and Machine Learning capabilities.Smarsh entered a five-year agreement with AWS to enhance its offerings for the financial services industry by leveraging Amazon Bedrock.AWS was selected by the Central Japan Railway Company. The latter is using AWS's Internet of Things, machine learning (ML) and GenAI capabilities to drive efficient operations for its next-generation, high-speed train service.A global gold producer named Gold Fields shifted its end-to-end SAP and treasury systems to AWS. Gold Fields is also leveraging AWS\u2019s analytics, ML and GenAI solutions to modernize technology infrastructure.Accenture joined forces with AWS to develop the Accenture Responsible Artificial Intelligence platform. Accenture leverages AWS\u2019s AI services, including Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker, along with AWS Control Tower, Amazon DataZone and AWS observability tools.Infor, a leading provider of a global leader in business cloud software, recently selected Amazon Bedrock to deploy GenAI solutions embedded within Infor CloudSuite.Robin AI teamed up with AWS to power its legal assistant by using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker.GE HealthCare selected AWS as its strategic cloud provider to accelerate healthcare transformation with GenAI. GEHC intends to utilize AWS\u2019s ML and GenAI capabilities for this purpose.\nAWS\u2019s expanding customer base on the back of its growing GenAI capabilities is expected to aid its long-term prospects.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $634.49 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 10.4%.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings stands at $4.74 per share, implying year-over-year growth of 63.5%. The estimate has moved north by 2.4% over the past 60 days.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon's current valuation presents a premium scenario, with its forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio of 2.85X exceeding the industry\u2019s average of 1.72X and the company\u2019s historical median of 2.76X. This reflects a stretched valuation. Hence, investors should wait for a better entry point.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon, being a cloud giant, presents a solid investment opportunity due to its deepening focus on generative AI, AI integration and innovative product development.However, stiff cloud competition, lofty valuation and macro uncertainties do not bode well for the company\u2019s near-term prospects.For current shareholders, holding on to the stock seems prudent, as the company\u2019s fundamental strengths and growth drivers are intact.

        "Author": "  Neha Gupta ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the\u00a010 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other the Stock That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years.\nThe US economy grew by 3% in the second quarter, and the stock market hit all-time highs in the third quarter, averting fears of a recession at hand. While the economy has remained resilient for the better part of the year, the US Federal Reserve\u2019s 50 basis point rate cut surprised many analysts.\nJamie Dimon believes the steep cut might be justified as geopolitical uncertainties can potentially disrupt the gains achieved by affecting supply chains and triggering uncertainties and fears in the market.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks\u00a0and\u00a010 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows.\nPowell and other Fed officials are open to further lowering interest rates after last month\u2019s half-point cut, but there\u2019s market debate on the pace.\nSoaring tensions in the Middle East with Israel invading Lebanon and threatening to attack Iran have triggered a layer of uncertainty, which Dimon believes could have a significant impact on the economy. Consequently, the banker believes that the 50 basis point cut could offer the much-needed economic support as inflation continues to drop.\nNevertheless, James Demerit, Main Street Research CIO, believes the upward momentum in the equity markets will persist as the macro environment improves. While valuations appear to have gotten out of hand, there are still opportunities for stocks trading below their fair value as the investment environment improves.\nApart from the magnificent seven stocks whose valuations have gotten out of hand, other stocks are trading at 16 times earnings, which, according to Demmert, is cheap considering the strong fundamentals that support a further rally. Companies that have consistently grown sales and profits should continue delivering regardless of the uncertainties around the US election and soaring geopolitical tensions.\nAccording to Emily Bowersock Hill, CEO of Bowersock Capital Partners, it is time to be upbeat about the market heading into year-end. \u201cThe bull market has survived the year\u2019s historically weakest quarter,\u201d said Hill in an interview with CNBC. \u201cIt is likely to remain intact through at least the end of the year, as earnings remain strong, interest rates are moving lower and consumers are still spending.\u201d\nWhen considering which stocks to buy, it\u2019s beneficial to ask, \u201cWhich industries are experiencing the most rapid growth?\u201d Despite some sectors facing challenges post-pandemic, many are flourishing, offering abundant opportunities. The global economy is rapidly evolving, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI), healthcare, travel, online retail, cybersecurity, and green energy experiencing significant growth. The AI market alone is projected to reach $407 billion by 2027 (according to estimates from Markets and Markets). The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that between 2020 and 2030, total employment in the United States will expand by 11.9 million, or 7.7%, to 165.4 million from 153.5 million.\nSome of the top stocks that will make you rich in 5 to 10 years are companies that can rally as the global economy grows on the back of favorable monetary policies. Additionally, they include stocks of companies that are leaders in their respective fields and well-poised to benefit from technological changes such as artificial intelligence.\nIn an interview with CNBC, Savita Subramanian, BofA Securities head, reiterated utilities and large-cap real estate stocks are well positioned to perform heading into year end. Likewise, industrials and financials should receive a significant boost if the overall economy improves.\nAccording to Subramanian, the idea of the Fed cutting is not only liquidity inducing that should benefit the equity market but a move that ends up cutting money market yields. With liquidity slowly moving out of short-term bonds, most of it is ending up in equity markets as investors take note of high-risk reward opportunities at highly discounted valuations. Subramanian believes dividend stocks and growth stocks are well-positioned to generate significant value going forward.\nWith this economic perspective in mind, let\u2019s start our list of stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years.\nPixabay/ Public Domain\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, we sifted through multiple reports and rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 possible stocks that experts and analysts believe have multi-year growth opportunities. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among hedge funds and ranked them in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them, as of the end of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 308\nThere is no doubt that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years, given its market-leading position in e-commerce, cloud computing and electronics. Additionally, it is making a name for itself amid the artificial intelligence race as it leverages technology to strengthen its competitive edge.\nOver the past two years, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s venture into generative AI has generated the most excitement for the stock. Consumers are utilizing and benefiting from Amazon\u2019s AI tools, which should allow the company to maintain its leading position in cloud computing and increase its market share as it invests in improvements and new features. In the second quarter, Amazon Web Services (AWS) sales growth accelerated to 18.8% year over year, attributed to the integration of AI.\nAI might offer Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) new opportunities and the biggest growth prospects. However, it is making investments in its other ventures and yielding outcomes. For some time now, Amazon\u2019s fastest-growing business has been advertising. In the second quarter of this year, revenue climbed by $2 billion, or 20% yearly.\nThrough sponsored ads on its e-commerce platform, it already provides unrivaled exposure to advertisers targeting Amazon customers; now, with the launch of its new ad-supported Prime streaming tier, Amazon and advertisers will have even more opportunities.\nRevenues were up by 10% in the second quarter to $148 billion, attributed to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s e-commerce and cloud computing dominance. Due to each of these divisions\u2019 advantages, investors should anticipate sustained growth from both of them. In the US, e-commerce only accounts for about 16% of retail sales.\nAs its cloud computing and e-commerce businesses grow, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is witnessing excellent margin expansion and revenue growth, affirming how it is well-positioned to generate long-term shareholder value. The operating margin reached an all-time high of 9% over the past 12 months. The robust growth justified the stock trading at a premium with a price-to-earnings multiple of 31.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\u201d\nOverall AMZN\u00a0ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of 10 stocks that will make you rich in 5-10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The technology was adapted for vans\u2019 cramped cargo areas and integrated with delivery-route navigation software.\n\u201cDelivery drivers will no longer have to spend time organizing packages by stops, reading labels or manually checking key identifiers like a customer\u2019s name or address to ensure they have the right packages,\u201d Amazon said in a release. \u201cThey simply have to look for VAPR\u2019s green light, grab and go.\u201d\nThe announcement underscores Amazon\u2019s shifting priorities under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who assumed the role from founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Bezos wowed the media with grandiose announcements that looked far into the future, such as fleets of autonomous delivery drones \u2014 a project still in the testing phase more than a decade after he announced it.\nUnder Jassy, who steered the company through layoffs and shuttered dozens of moonshot projects, the focus is on near-term efforts to shave costs and make Amazon\u2019s low-margin e-commerce business more appealing to Wall Street investors prone to fret about slim profits.\nThe Seattle-based company relies on a network of small businesses that use 100,000 vans and employ 390,000 drivers to deliver packages.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s controversial decision to bring corporate employees back to the office full-time reflects executives\u2019 concerns that recent recruits don\u2019t understand the company\u2019s unique culture.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nChicago\u2019s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil\nSan Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World\u2019s Most Unequal Nation\nShould Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters?\nFrom Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums\nLast month, Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy surprised employees with a memo ordering them to start reporting to their desks five days a week, beginning in January. Amazon currently lets many of them work from home two days a week.\nThe return-to-office edict stunned many of the company\u2019s 350,000-plus corporate workers and renewed a heated debate in the tech industry about employee perks and the value of in-person work. Amazon employees and pundits wondered if this was Jassy\u2019s way of further thinning the ranks following a series of layoffs in recent years. After all, the CEO also expressed his intention to reduce management layers in an effort to cut through bureaucracy he said was slowing Amazon down.\nBut the senior leadership made the change, at least in part, because they believed the next generation of workers was being left behind rather than taught the Amazon way, according to three people familiar with the deliberations. Jassy mentioned the word \u201cculture\u201d a dozen times in his memo. \u201cKeeping your culture strong is not a birthright,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou have to work at it all the time.\u201d\nBrad Glasser, an Amazon spokesperson, declined to comment beyond Jassy\u2019s memo.\nAmazon, which sees itself as a collection of teams operating like startups, has long acknowledged its culture may seem peculiar to outsiders. Employees pitching new ideas are expected to write detailed memos and avoid slide decks. There\u2019s a strong preference for sharp analysis of data and trends, and plenty of tolerance for frank and heated debate.\nThe e-commerce and cloud computing giant is also a famously tough environment. Employees are expected to work long, hard and smart, as founder Jeff Bezos put it to the company\u2019s first recruits. Aggressive deadlines are common, as are late-night laptop sessions for many employees.\nJassy, who started at Amazon out of business school in 1997, is a product of and advocate for those approaches, colleagues say. Since succeeding Bezos three years ago, he\u2019s been a one-man ambassador for the Amazon culture, speaking frequently to employee groups and even cutting videos in which he expounds on each of Amazon\u2019s sacrosanct leadership principles.\nDuring the pandemic, Amazon doubled its headcount and dropped requirements that recruits be physically located in a major hub with their team. Executives have since mused openly that many new recruits, especially fresh grads new to the workforce, are missing elements of the company\u2019s culture that can\u2019t be effectively conveyed in videoconferences or chat windows, according to the people, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter.\n\u201cCulture is a very important part of how we go and do the work, and how we have maintained the innovation and pace of what we do for the last 25 years,\u201d Amazon Web Services chief Matt Garman said at a press event last week, when asked about the company\u2019s return-to-office plans. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really hard to communicate, really hard to teach to new employees and really hard to maintain when you\u2019re over a video call.\u201d\nMindful that the new schedule would be controversial, the senior leadership spent weeks weighing the pros and cons, according to two of the people. The company denies the policy was designed to push workers out.\nBut it\u2019s doubtful the leadership\u2019s arguments will mollify employees. Internal chat rooms focused on return-to-office issues lit up after Jassy sent his memo. In internal surveys, workers expressed dissatisfaction and pressed the company to reconsider. Some Amazonians have already resigned, and others are seeking work elsewhere. The last time Amazon ordered employees back to the office, it sparked a walkout at the company\u2019s Seattle headquarters. It\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019ll make a similar attempt again.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nLina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes)\nMusk Reveals Why He\u2019s Jumping Into Trump\u2019s Arms\nChina Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space\nHow Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession\nRate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Investing.com -- Pivotal Research Group has initiated coverage of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a \"buy\" rating, citing the company\u2019s strong organic growth potential and its robust position across several sectors.\nIn a note dated Friday, analysts at Pivotal flagged Amazon\u2019s broad expansion opportunities, particularly driven by its cloud services division, Amazon Web Services, which they predict will grow from 17% of total revenue in 2024 to over 35% within the next five years.\nThis substantial growth is expected to be fueled by the increasing adoption of cloud technologies, particularly as artificial intelligence capabilities continue to expand across industries.\nBeyond cloud services, Pivotal pointed out that Amazon has vast potential to grow its e-commerce and retail businesses by leveraging its infrastructure to expand into new markets, especially in sectors like grocery and pharmacy.\nThe company\u2019s international footprint is also expected to expand, along with improvements in delivery speeds and fulfillment operations.\nAmazon's advertising business, which is already the third-largest globally, is projected to capture more market share, further diversifying its revenue streams.\nPivotal also noted Amazon\u2019s ability to develop new revenue channels through technological advancements like robotics, AI, and autonomous vehicles.\nAnalysts at Pivotal argue that these emerging technologies will not only support operational efficiency but could also lead to margin expansion over the next five years, driving operating margins up from the current 10% to approximately 20% by 2029.\nKey to Amazon\u2019s value proposition, as per Pivotal, is its ability to capitalize on scale, efficiency, and higher-margin businesses like AWS and advertising.\nThese factors, combined with potential cost reductions through AI and automation, place Amazon in a strong position to continue its dominance in the technology sector.\nDespite the bullish outlook, Pivotal also warned of several risks that could affect Amazon\u2019s trajectory. These include regulatory pressures, as the company faces potential antitrust actions, and concerns that Amazon may lag behind competitors in AI development.\nAdditionally, the Kuiper satellite project, aimed at providing global internet coverage, poses a financial risk, although it is seen as a long-term bet that could enhance Amazon\u2019s logistics and retail capabilities.\nPivotal values Amazon using a discounted cash flow model, forecasting a 30% annual growth in free cash flow per share, supported by strong growth in AWS and advertising.\nThe brokerage has set a year-end 2025 price target of $260 for Amazon\u2019s stock, reflecting confidence in the company\u2019s ability to sustain its market leadership while expanding into new high-growth areas\u200b.\nRelated Articles\nPivotal Research begins Amazon coverage, sees strong growth with $260 PT\nRussian court orders seizure of $155.8 million in JPMorgan Chase funds in VTB lawsuit\nFastenal shares gain over 2% as Q3 earnings top estimates\n"

        "Text": "Amazon Ads announced several new capabilities that leverage its deep, full-funnel insights to help brands launch new products and extend its sophisticated measurement and optimization ad tech to all advertisers\nAUSTIN, Texas, October 15, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(NASDAQ: AMZN) \u2014 At unBoxed 2024, Amazon Ads launched a suite of new advertising capabilities that bring together insights from across the marketing funnel to help advertisers optimize their media investments. The announcements showcased how Amazon Ads is making its powerful insights easier to access and activate by every advertiser, across every ad product.\n\"Our mission is to be the most customer-obsessed advertising service by giving all brands the measurement and data-driven, machine learning optimization capabilities they need to drive business growth through simple, easy-to-use tools,\" said Paula Despins, Vice President of Ads Measurement at Amazon Ads. \"Today\u2019s launches put our most sophisticated full-funnel measurement and optimization capabilities into the hands of all marketers from small businesses to major brands.\"\nAccelerate new product launches and reach high-value customers\nAs a leading destination for product discovery, Amazon has a unique ability to help brands successfully launch new products. New product campaigns are a fully-managed service that help brands quickly introduce new products to customers within the first 90 days of their launch, through advertising placements across Amazon\u2019s properties and leading broadcasters and publishers.\nNew product campaigns help customers discover and learn about new products through clear and consistent messaging in the places they\u2019re choosing to spend time \u2013 so that they can move from awareness, to consideration, to purchasing great products they want or need. For example, a customer could see an ad for an easy-to-use espresso machine while watching Prime Video. A week or so later, the customer may hear an ad for that espresso machine on Amazon Music and learn it\u2019s designed to save counter space. The next time they\u2019re shopping in the Amazon store, they may see a display ad for the same espresso machine that highlights it\u2019s Prime-eligible. At this point the customer is more familiar with the product, putting them that much closer to a purchase. Advertisers using these media plans saw a 9% increase in their weekly sales growth on average compared to those that did not.\nOnce a product is launched advertisers need solutions that enable them to both continue acquiring new customers and engaging prospective customers as they move through the funnel, on an ongoing basis. According to a study by Boston Consulting Group, on average, advertisers need to reach customers at least 20 times before they make a purchase. To help advertisers do this more efficiently, Amazon Ads has audience bid boosting to re-engage shoppers reached on streaming TV through Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products ads. Advertisers using Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC), Amazon Ads secure clean room technology, can now adjust their Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products bids specifically for audiences who have seen their streaming TV ads and also visited their website, for example, focusing their investments on these high-value customers.\n\"For over a century, Newell Brands\u2019 products have been a trusted presence in households around the world. When we launched our latest products, we knew we needed a strategy that could effectively reach audiences across multiple platforms, and partnering with Amazon Ads made that possible. Amazon\u2019s full-funnel approach for new product launches has helped us reach customers wherever they are\u2014whether they\u2019re watching Prime Video or browsing Amazon,\" said Michal Geller, President of eCommerce & Digital at Newell Brands.\nSimplify insights with AMC solutions\nAMC enables advertisers to join their first-party data with Amazon Ads signals to understand the customer journey and build and activate audiences. New AMC solutions introduce no-code capabilities in an intuitive interface \u2013 extending AMC\u2019s sophisticated analytics capabilities to brands of all sizes. Now any Amazon advertiser can use AMC to quickly uncover advanced audience and measurement insights, and optimize their campaigns.\nThe first two AMC solutions launching are high value audience and optimal frequency analyses. Brands can use the high value solution to instantly visualize how their customer base is distributed by total spend levels over a period of time. With just a few clicks they can create related audience segments and activate them in future campaigns. With the optimal frequency solution, advertisers can monitor how KPIs like conversion rate and return on ad spend evolve as ad interactions increase, and from there, determine the most efficient frequency caps for their campaign.\nHonest Kitchen, a CPG brand, used the optimal frequency AMC solution to improve their Amazon DSP campaign performance. After better understanding their cross-campaign ad frequency, Honest Kitchen was able to adjust their daily frequency caps to increase their impressions by 23% and Amazon.com product detail page views by 44% \u2013 all while maintaining nearly the same budget.\nMeasure attribution, report on conversion paths, and project long-term sales\nAmazon Ads announced a new multi-touch attribution model that helps advertisers understand how their marketing works to drive conversions, going beyond last touch attribution to consider the relative contribution of each marketing touchpoint leading to a conversion. Using advanced machine learning models to analyze trillions of shopping, streaming, and browsing signals, multi-touch attribution determines the relative impact of ad interactions along the path to purchase. It uses advanced techniques like hundreds of thousands of randomized control trial experiments \u2013 A/B tests \u2013 to establish impact. For example, if an advertiser uses streaming TV, display, Sponsored Products, and other ad types in their campaigns, multi-touch attribution will show the relative contribution of each tactic to their sales. Amazon Ads will start to test multi-touch attribution later this year, with a full rollout planned for 2025.\nTo help advertisers understand the insights from multi-touch attribution, Amazon Ads is launching conversion path reporting to show brands their top-converting paths to purchase from the previous 30-days. For example, advertisers might see their TV ad is showing in their top-converting paths and learn how it helped drive conversions through lower funnel channels. Conversion path reporting is AMC\u2019s most popular insight report and it will soon be available self-service in ad console and Amazon DSP reports. It is currently in closed beta and will be available to U.S. advertisers in open beta later this year.\nAdvertisers also want to measure beyond immediate sales and understand the long-term impact of their upper-funnel tactics on outcomes. Long term sales insights estimate the sales that a brand can expect to generate over the next year based on how effectively their campaign moves new-to-brand shoppers down the purchase funnel. For example, a customer may click on an ad and engage with a brand for the first time by visiting their product page, and go on to purchase from that brand months later. With long-term sales insights, that campaign now receives credit for the new product page visit based on the historical outcome from customers who have also visited a product page. Together, immediate sales and long-term sales metrics help advertisers quantify immediate sales and potential return from driving key customer engagements throughout the funnel. Long-term sales insights are currently in closed beta and will be available to U.S. advertisers in open beta later this year.\nTo learn more about all of the announcements at unBoxed 2024, go to ads.amazon.com.\nAbout Amazon Ads\nAmazon Ads offers full-funnel advertising solutions to help businesses of all sizes achieve their marketing goals at scale.

Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nTom Lee, Fundstrat co-founder, while talking to CNBC in a latest program, explained his bullish case for the market and why he believes the S&P 500 is headed to close the year \u201cwell beyond\u201d 5,700.\n\u201cBull markets are supported by a strong fundamentals and this is a case where not only has the economy survivie extremely high interest rates but the Fed is beginning to cut rates, and an economy that has been sort of languishing has been China. Now we have stimulus and what looks like some bazooka policies that are supporting that region, and we have a lot of cash on the sidelines. I think this is a formula for stocks to do pretty well the next three to 12 months, and that\u2019s why we think that we would be well beyond 5700 before year-end.\u201d\nLee said that he\u2019s inclined to buy \u201crisks outright\u201d as he believes more upward momentum would come for stocks after the election.\n\u201cSmall caps still have good fundamentals, earnings growth is accelerating, the media P/E is eleven times which is almost seven turns lower than the S&P so I think there is still case to be made that small-cap are starting a multi-year gain.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks that are making big moves on the back of latest news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\nWilliam Blair analysts see Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a major beneficiary of generative AI, primarily through its AWS cloud division and e-commerce platform. \u201cAWS\u2019s extensive infrastructure and leading position in the cloud market make it an ideal choice for developing large language models and deploying GenAI applications,\u201d said analysts Arjun Bhatia and Dylan Carden. They believe growing demand for compute resources driven by GenAI workloads will fuel AWS\u2019s growth, given the resource-heavy nature of LLMs and GenAI applications. The investment bank also expects GenAI to improve user experiences on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) e-commerce platform.\nAWS\u2019s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon\u2019s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.\u201d\nOverall,\u00a0Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks in October. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Should Not Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\nCompanies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to meet the growing demands of machine learning, data processing, and AI-driven applications. This spending is largely concentrated on building data centers, acquiring specialized hardware, and optimizing cloud infrastructure. According to a report by McKinsey, global AI infrastructure spending could reach up to $500 billion by 2027, highlighting the critical role it plays in the future of AI development. A large part of this investment is focused on AI-specific hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are crucial for training and deploying AI models. NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI chips, has seen demand for its GPUs soar, largely due to their centrality in deep learning tasks. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, has remarked that the AI boom is underpinned by massive infrastructure needs, and the market is just at the beginning of this growth curve.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nData centers are another focal point for AI infrastructure spending. AI workloads are highly demanding, requiring specialized facilities that can support high-density computing environments. Blackstone\u2019s $16 billion acquisition of AirTrunk, a leader in AI-driven data centers, underscores the increasing importance of such infrastructure. The deal will add 800 MW of data center capacity, with projections to grow beyond 1 GW, a testament to the rising demand for infrastructure to support AI-driven applications. Cloud infrastructure is also a major area where companies are pouring resources. Cloud giants are increasing their investments in AI infrastructure. These companies are developing new AI-optimized cloud services to cater to businesses adopting AI. Gartner predicts that by 2026, cloud AI infrastructure spending will surpass $200 billion, as enterprises increasingly shift from on-premise AI deployments to scalable cloud-based solutions.\nThomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, recently remarked that AI is unlocking entirely new revenue streams for enterprises, and cloud infrastructure is the backbone enabling this transformation. Beyond just hardware, organizations are also investing in data management platforms and storage solutions to handle the massive amounts of data AI systems require. In fact, estimates suggest that the global AI data infrastructure market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18%, driven by increased data volumes and the need for real-time data processing capabilities. Companies are significantly ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, focusing on hardware, data centers, and cloud computing. With projections showing continued growth in AI workloads, this spending will only increase in the coming years.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) had agreed to invest over $4 billion into the company in the coming months.\nThe British regulator said the partnership did not qualify for investigation under merger rules. Anthropic, which was co-founded by former OpenAI executives and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, has received billions of dollars in investments from several tech giants, including Amazon rival Google. The startup is preparing to raise fresh funding at a valuation of around $40 billion.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss.

        "Title": "Amazon employees slam CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s demand to return to office \u2014 do American workers have a right to work from home?",
        "Author": "  Christy Bieber ",
        "Text": "Amazon employees are up-in-arms over a recent note from CEO Andy Jassy alerting them to a change in policy about remote work.\nIn a Sept. 16 letter, Jassy said that employees would be expected to return to the office five days a week, barring extenuating circumstances or a remote work exception, beginning on Jan. 2, 2025.\nHere is the true value of having a fully paid-off home in America \u2014 especially when you're heading into retirement\n'I could've been set for life': This former Goldman Sachs analyst says his family of 4 can't live comfortably on $230K a year after buying 'forever home.' Is the American dream out of reach?\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years \u2014 but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger\nAs Jassy pointed out: \"Some of our teammates may have set up their personal lives in such a way that returning to the office consistently five days per week will require some adjustments,\" but he's made clear that this isn't optional given the type of team he'd like to create.\nUnsurprisingly, however, many workers aren't pleased with the forced change. The big question, though, is what can they do about it?\nAmazon, like many companies, went fully remote during COVID but shifted to a hybrid schedule in May of 2023. Under that policy change, workers were required to come into the office three days a week. At that time, 1,000 employees staged a walkout to protest and 30,000 signed a petition requesting a retraction of the new requirements to be in office.\nThose employees who express their opinions through walkouts and petitions may enjoy protections under the National Labor Relations Act, which gives all workers the right to engage in \"protected concerted activity\" including strikes, picketing or protesting, as long as the employees are responding to a work-related issue that concerns their interests.\nIt's up to the NLRB to determine whether the activity is protected, though, and employers are typically allowed to bring in temporary employees when their regular staff stops working for a protest.\nIn some cases, this type of activity will prompt employers to reconsider their position or to work with their staff members to find a mutually agreeable solution. In Amazon's case, however, the three-day a week policy that the workers were protesting went into effect, and the CEO has now doubled down by mandating workers begin coming in five days weekly.\nSince the company wasn't responsive last time, they probably won't be swayed by the anger workers are currently expressing. Many aired their grievances in an internal Slack channel seen by Business Insider, including some who expressed a desire to get fired or a plan to take their money and find work elsewhere.\nUnfortunately, while those workers can express their anger and even stage further protests, ultimately they may have few choices but to come back to work, quit or, as some say is their plan, force Amazon to terminate them for failure to perform.\nRead More: Feeling broke on a $665K salary: This surgeon and his wife didn't realize their financial adviser may have been charging a high fee until Ramit Sethi set things straight\nThe general rule in the United States is that workers are at will employees. They can be fired for any reason or no reason at all \u2014 and failure to return to the office when required would certainly be a justification for letting them go.\nThere are some limited exceptions to this rule. If someone has an employment contract negotiated on their own, or as part of a union, then an employer can't violate its terms. If it says staff can work remotely, employers must allow them to do so unless they can renegotiate the deal.\nLikewise, being able to work from home is sometimes considered a reasonable accommodation for a disability, although this is more likely when an employer does allow some telework and it usually won't be an option if the company can accommodate the disability in-office.\nThe bottom line is that Amazon workers are probably out of luck and just have to head back to the office. And the same is true for others who may be working remotely but whose companies change the rules.\nIf your employer says you must come into the office, you'll need to listen or look for another position with a remote-friendly business that won't force you to make that dreaded commute.\nArizona man says his gap insurance won't pay an $18,000 claim for his totaled BMW because of a 60-cent mistake\nTexas man used to spend $9,000 a month partying, now refuses to work more than 15 hours a week to pay off debt\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof \u2014 and only getting worse. But 5 minutes could have you paying as little as $29/month\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice. It is provided without warranty of any kind.\n"

Google employees, who currently work in the office three days a week, sought reassurance about their hybrid work model during a \u201cTGIF\u201d all-hands meeting.\nJohn Casey, Google\u2019s vice president of global compensation and benefits, informed staff that the existing system remains effective, according to the report. However, he stressed the importance of being in the office at least three days weekly. Pichai reiterated the need for productivity during remote work to maintain policy flexibility.\nDespite these reassurances, some Google employees remain apprehensive about potential future changes. Google has implemented measures like hot-desking and \u201cneighborhoods\u201d in some offices to adapt to the hybrid model.

This shift has affected morale, especially among parents.\nMoreover, the return-to-office mandates have impacted housing markets, with cities like San Jose experiencing a surge in housing prices.

        "Author": " Anjalee Khemlani    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Amazon Pharmacy (AMZN) announced same-day delivery for prescriptions in 20 new states Wednesday, expanding its service to include nearly half of the US in 2025.\nThe service, Amazon said in a statement, provides delivery \"within hours\" for customer prescriptions, as long as the order is received by 4 p.m. for delivery up to 10 p.m.\nThe announcement, part of Amazon's Delivering the Future event in Nashville, will ramp up competition among big pharmacy retailers, which already have similar services for additional fees.\nWalgreens (WBA), for example, offers same-day delivery from 8,000 stores \u2014 with caveats that orders must be placed by 4 p.m. on weekdays and 1 p.m. on weekends, and it only applies to refills for eligible prescriptions. CVS (CVS), meanwhile, offers a similar service at \"almost all\" of its stores, with much the same caveats. It specifies on its website that deliveries for same-day will arrive within four hours.\nWalmart (WMT) does not have a same-day option but offers overnight delivery for a $15 fee.\nAmazon has been investing in its healthcare suite amid an industrywide recoil on brick-and-mortar services.\nWalgreens, for example, has pulled out of its clinic offerings, and Walmart recently shuttered its clinic locations. CVS, meanwhile, is focused on a primary care approach, as is Amazon with its One Medical unit.\nThe same-day strategy, according to Amazon, will help with the problem of patients who do not refill their prescriptions in time. (As many as a third of patients, according to the National Community Pharmacists Association.)\n\"This rapid access increases the likelihood patients engage immediately in their care and adhere to treatment routines, which is shown to improve health outcomes,\" said Amazon Pharmacy chief medical officer Dr. Vin Gupta.\nTo date, Amazon has declined to reveal health unit-specific data but continues to invest heavily in expansion on all fronts. The company is building out more One Medical sites, and the announcement Wednesday showcases an investment in building out logistics for medicines.\nThe expansion complements a contraction of physical pharmacy locations around the country. Major retailers like CVS and Walgreens have closed several hundred stores in the past year, and vertically integrated companies like CVS and UnitedHealth (UNH) have begun to rely on mail order as a way to fill the gap.\nWhile the deliveries will become part of the Same Day delivery sites Amazon already has, there is some buildout needed, such as mini pharmacy locations to help decrease delivery time. These mini-sites include robotic arms and other automation to help speedily fill prescriptions \u2014 but are overseen by licensed pharmacists and pharmacy technicians.\nThe same-day delivery of medicines began in New York City and Los Angeles earlier this year. Some of the new cities include Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and San Diego.\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

The four seats face inward, as the toaster-like cabin operates bidirectionally, meaning it can drive both ways.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a vehicle specifically made for people and not for drivers,\u201d said co-founder and chief technical officer Jesse Levinson. \u201cWe realized if there isn't a human driver, you can completely change [the riding experience].\u201d\nZoox touts its vehicles as purpose-built, designed specifically for autonomy. Levinson hopes that approach helps propel Zoox to the front of the pack as the company prepares to launch commercial driverless taxi rides in Las Vegas next year.\nZoox's entry into the nascent market would pit it against Google\u2019s (GOOG) Waymo, the market leader in robotaxis so far, and Tesla (TSLA), which offered more hints this week about the evolution of its full self-driving technology.\nOn Thursday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk unveiled the Cybercab prototype at the company's \"We, Robot\" event, saying that the EV maker plans to sell the robotaxi for $30,000 and start production before 2027, though Musk's timelines have been delayed before. It also revealed a Robovan concept capable of transporting 20 people.\nBefore the event, Levinson was quick to point out that the technology Zoox uses is entirely different from that of Tesla. Unlike the Amazon-owned firm, which uses a network of sensors, cameras, and mics, Tesla relies on a camera-based vision system, which is seen as more affordable. Musk has also pushed for the cars to be able to operate in any environment, unlike Google's Waymo, which digitally maps the routes it operates in with a human behind the wheel first before the autonomous cars are deployed.\nMore consequentially, according to Levinson, Tesla\u2019s autopilot currently uses a driver assistance system, which requires drivers to retake control of the car at any time. That\u2019s fundamentally different from the autonomy-first approach that Zoox is taking, he said.\n\u201cIt might sound like that's a small difference, but it's actually a giant difference because it means that no matter what's happening in your environment, and it means no matter what's going wrong with your sensors or if they're covered up or if they're occluded, or even if they fail, you still have to be able to keep driving safely,\u201d he said. \u201cTeslas and passenger cars today, they're just not designed that way. And so it's a really, a very different hardware and software product entirely.\u201d\nAutonomous cars remain an intriguing ambition for tech companies despite delays in the wider rollout of driverless taxi services. Consulting firm McKinsey & Co. estimates the global robotaxi market could generate as much as $1.3 trillion in revenue by 2030.\nBut implementation has been fragmented, with commercial operations limited to a handful of cities. Companies that have successfully made it to market have opted to retrofit cars intended for drivers to achieve full autonomy.\nZoox\u2019s approach pivots away from that model. The company has specifically relied on a sensor suite that includes lidar, radar, and cameras to navigate a limited stretch of roads. The vehicles, built in-house, include a sound bar surrounding the cabin, with mics built into the interior and exterior of the vehicle, in part to enhance the detection of emergency vehicle sirens.\nWhile Zoox assembles vehicles at its own manufacturing facility in California, the company purchases large modules from suppliers to control overall costs tied to automotive manufacturing, according to the firm.\nLevinson said vehicles are equipped with redundancies for critical components to ensure safety. There are two braking systems, two steering racks, two batteries, two motors, and four sensor pods in each corner.\n\"If any one of those components has a hardware or software failure, not only is it still safe, but we can actually keep driving and take the customer to their destination,\" Levinson said. \"Just like if there's a component failure on an airplane, you still land the plane, you don't drop out of the sky.\"\nThose redundancies are coupled with human technicians, who monitor the vehicles for safety. While the cars operate fully autonomously, technicians step in on rare occasions to guide the vehicle when it encounters unfamiliar situations, like construction zones, according to Levinson.\n\"The vehicles are only getting help from humans only 1% of the time,\" Levinson said. \"As it gets more sophisticated, the amount of time they\u2019re asking for help goes down and down and down and down. We don\u2019t think it ever truly gets to zero, but it doesn\u2019t have to get to zero. It just has to go down to something that\u2019s very small.\"\nFor now, Levinson said he\u2019s confident that Zoox is on the right track for the future. It is on target to expand beyond its five-mile test loop in Las Vegas, with commercial service set to launch in 2025.\n\u201cIn the long term, more and more companies will converge on something like this,\u201d he said, pointing to his vehicle, \u201cwhere you've really imagined the experience without needing all the legacy of a car.\u201d\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.\nUS technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk.\nWhile tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nThis has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave \u2014 particularly in software and cloud services.\nTheir scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants.\nLet's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. JMP Securities analyst Nicholas Jones recently penned an investor note on the company, maintaining an Outperform rating with a price target of $265. In the note, the analyst underlined that it was possible for Amazon to save more than $20 billion annually by deploying autonomous technology combined with electric combination trucks for middle-mile transport and replacing internal combustion engine delivery vans with electric Rivian Automotive delivery vans. Per the analyst fuel cost tended to be 25%-30% of the per mile costs in middle-mile and last-mile delivery, while electric vehicles could generate a nearly 50% reduction in per-mile energy costs.\nJMP viewed this as a medium- to long-term opportunity for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). More near term, as the company converted its last-mile fleet to electric Rivian fans, there was potential for up to $7 billion of annual savings, globally, contended the analyst. Amazon has deployed 15,000 Rivian vans in the US and thousands across Europe, according to JMP.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other widely held stocks.\nThe last trading day of September is upon us and so are many questions about the market. On September 30, Dana D\u2019Auria, Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the financial market.\nD'Auria regards employment data to be a major concern at the moment. Since inflation rates are subsiding, employment data is something investors should be on the lookout for, along with other data points including GDP and consumer confidence. She suggests that to ensure a soft landing, the Fed must initiate larger rate cuts, and that recessionary conditions are out of the picture.\nSeptember is notoriously volatile along with October, and, with elections in another 35 days, the conditions may be slightly different or even more turbulent. According to D'Auria, the 50 basis point cut is a catch-up for July, and expecting a 50 basis point cut in November is borderline questionable.\nOverall, she believes that the market has been overshooting and we may have to settle for two 25 basis point cuts before the end of 2024. She reiterates that the job market is crucial and investors must get out of their comfort zone to invest in non-cash opportunities. Investors concerned about low-risk options may consider equities in the defensive sectors that are innately low volatile.\nWall Street is heading to close September and Q3 on a high note and stocks have experienced their best September in over a decade. On September 30, Kevin Gordon, harles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis.\nGordon believes that stocks in the utilities and defensive sectors have caught up to tech stocks amid the AI boom, compared to their financials at the end of FY 2023. However, he does acknowledge that sectors like industrials, financials, and materials are performing relatively well, calling it a case of market broadening.\nIn terms of market breadth, most sectors are experiencing an upward trajectory. Almost 81% of the S&P 500 members are experiencing an uptrend, despite the quality bias investors may have towards certain stocks. According to Gordon, large-cap quality stocks will continue to perform well despite the volatility and the Fed's decisions. Speaking of smaller-cap stocks, he believes that some stocks may struggle a bit especially when it comes to earnings growth.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 most widely held stocks by hedge funds, we sifted through Insider Monkey's database that tracks over 900 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. We ranked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Its e-commerce platform is functional in 20 countries and ships to over 100 countries. Its proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services, on the other hand, is used by millions of active customers and has over 130,000 AWS partners in 200 countries.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also prominent on the AI front. Over the past few months, the company has partnered with AI startups like Anthropic and signed deals with the US government to test new AI models. As for AI hardware, the company has produced several AI chips to reduce its dependence on other companies. Amazon is efficiently branching out to multiple industries, which explains why it is widely held by hedge funds.\nSpeaking of AI, AWS is now housing the next generation of Llama models from Meta, giving customers more choices to build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications. The new models are capable of visual reasoning, document processing, and multilingual translation. On September 19, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched Project Amelia, a selling assistant backed by generative AI. Sellers will immensely benefit from the tool, allowing them to receive answers and advice immediately, for better customer assistance and reach.\nAnalysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to an 18% upside from current levels. Overall, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds and Fisher Asset Management\u00a0was the largest shareholder, according to the Insider Monkey database.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\"Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business.

        "Text": "Having an Amazon Prime subscription seems ubiquitous these days. At $139 per year, or $14.99 per month, the service comes with a steep price, yet it can still seem worth it thanks to the plethora of advantages it provides, such as convenience, fast and free shipping as well as streaming.\nConsider This: 9 Easiest Ways To Maximize Your Savings in 2024\nDiscover More: 5 \u2018Necessities\u2019 Frugal People Don\u2019t Buy, According to Frugal Living Expert Austin Williams\nYet, some experts said that beyond the subscription price, there are also several reasons why cutting the service can save you a lot of money.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nAs Steve Sexton, CEO of Sexton Advisory Group, noted, the fact that Amazon Prime is accessible and incredibly fast is what makes it easy to overuse, which can lead to overspending.\n\u201cWith Amazon Prime, quite literally almost everything is at your fingertips, encouraging consumers to spend whenever, wherever \u2014 which can be problematic if you don\u2019t have self-restraint or have trouble following a budget,\u201d said Sexton.\nCheck Out: 5 Unnecessary Bills You Should Stop Paying in 2024\nTo decide if getting rid of your Amazon Prime membership will save you money or not, the first question to ask yourself is whether you make enough purchases to warrant that cost.\nFor instance, are the items you are purchasing items you truly need and does the cost fit into your household budget, argued consumer finance expert Tanya Peterson, vice president of brand at Achieve.\nAsk yourself whether you could reasonably purchase items you need in person at a local retail store, she added.\n\u201cRemember the \u2018old days\u2019 when you made a list of what you needed at certain stores and then went to the stores once a week/month/etc. to purposely shop?\u201d said Peterson.\nFor instance, Peterson said you might want to consider the entertainment component of Amazon Prime.\nAs with other entertainment subscription services, if you truly have favorite programs that you watch regularly, it may be worth it, she said.\n\u201cBut if you could easily get by with other services you have \u2014 or a high-quality antenna and your local library\u2019s services \u2014 you may be able to save money by eliminating Amazon Prime,\u201d Peterson added.\nIn addition, consider the other services that come with the service, as many consumers don\u2019t use all of them.\nIf, for example, you find yourself going to Whole Foods only because you have Amazon Prime \u2014 and might find something on sale for which you can use your membership \u2014 you\u2019ll likely save more without it, she said.\nSimilarly, while Amazon Pharmacy may offer best prices on some medications, it\u2019s not a reason in and of itself to have Prime, since you can use it without being a member, Peterson explained.\nAs Justin Haywood, CFP, president and co-founder, Haywood Wealth Management, said, when your Prime account is active, it makes it incredibly easy to shop and get immediate gratification.\n\u201cThe convenience of fast, free shipping encourages impulse buying, leading to more frequent purchases,\u201d he said, adding that without Prime, you\u2019re more likely to pause and reconsider before making a purchase, which can cut down on unnecessary spending.\nSexton echoed the sentiment, saying that while going to a store might be more inconvenient. It gives most people time to think about whether they really need certain items.\nMeanwhile, he added, with Amazon Prime, there is literally no barrier to purchasing any item that crosses your mind. Even for those who aren\u2019t typically spendy, it can be too easy to give into impulse purchases you don\u2019t need.\n\u201cFor those who have trouble with impulse shopping, refraining from using Amazon Prime will most certainly save them money in the long run,\u201d Sexton said.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money\n12 SUVs With the Most Reliable Engines\n5 Low-Risk Accounts Financially Savvy People Trust for Reliable Returns (And How You Can Use Them)\nI'm a Debt Expert: Here's How Social Media Warps Our Perceptions of Debt\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 4 Reasons Cutting Amazon Prime Will Actually Save You Money\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 7.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.14 per share, indicating a change of +34.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 points to a change of +63.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.2%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 indicates a change of +23.1% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $157.05 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +9.8%. The $634.49 billion and $702.76 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.4% and +10.8%, respectively.\nAmazon reported revenues of $147.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.63 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.44%. The EPS surprise was +17.14%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Rufus allows shoppers to view previous orders, request product updates and see product details in what CEO Andy Jassy called \u201ca significant customer experience improvement for discovery.\u201d\u00a0\nAmazon said that its visual search queries have jumped 70% globally year over year as shoppers take advantage of its new features. Following the launch of these tools, the e-commerce giant said it will be looking for feedback on its new visual search capabilities will continue to enhance them.\nMeanwhile, other companies have been developing image search enhancements for online shoppers. In 2021, Google introduced its image search button, which allows all images on a page to be searchable and shoppable.\u00a0The following year, Etsy unveiled its visual image search tool, which lets shoppers upload or take pictures of the items they're seeking on its marketplace.\u00a0\nBeyond helping shoppers find their desired items, companies have been introducing tools to help sellers create captivating product images. Last year, Google debuted its Product Studio, where sellers can create new backgrounds for their product images, remove visual distractions and sharpen the image resolution. Similarly, eBay launched its photo background enhancement tool, allowing merchants to replace their image background with an AI-generated backdrop.\n"

        "Title": "Time to Buy Amazon ETFs Following Cathie Wood's Investment?",
        "Author": "  Sanghamitra Saha ",
        "Text": "Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Investment Management, is well-known for her focus on small- and mid-cap technology stocks. She rose to fame after Ark Innovation ETF ARKK delivered a remarkable 73% return in 2020.\nHowever, the long-term success of Cathie Wood\u2019s strategy has not been remarkable. ARKK, her flagship exchange-traded fund (ETF) with $5.5 billion in assets, has posted a 25.7% return over the past year, and a modest 12.2% over five years. By comparison, the S&P 500 has returned 35% over one year, and 95.4% over five years.\nWood\u2019s investment philosophy thrives on emerging high-tech companies in fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, DNA sequencing, energy storage, and robotics. However, she occasionally taps mega-cap stocks to provide stability for her funds, which primarily consist of higher-risk assets. Sometimes, Wood even buys these stocks during price increases.\nDespite the challenges, Wood has lately made notable moves in the market. On Oct. 8, 2024, Ark Innovation ETF purchased 76,505 shares of Amazon, valued at $14 million. Amazon\u2019s stock has risen 18% since Aug. 5, although it did record a 9.8% decline from Sept. 24 to Oct. 8.\nMorningstar analyst Dan Romanoff is also optimistic about Amazon, assigning the company a wide moat tag due to its dominant position in e-commerce and cloud services, and setting a fair value of $195, as quoted on street.com.\nPlus, Ark Next Generation Internet ETF acquired 2,365 shares of Meta Platforms, worth $1.4 million at the Oct. 8, 2024 close. Meta\u2019s stock has surged 16% over the past month. Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan views Meta as slightly overvalued but believes it holds a wide moat, largely due to its unchallenged social media presence across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, as quoted on street.com.\nAmazon.com has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has the best VGM Score of \u201cA.\u201d The stock comes from the top-ranked Internet \u2013 Commerce industry (top 18%). Amazon is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio.\nAmazon is often considered as a wide-moat stock. Amazon is the clear leader in e-commerce, with a cost advantage and network effects that attract more buyers and sellers. The company has been disrupting the retail industry for more than two decades, per Morningstar. Thus, picking Amazon stock ahead of the start of the holiday season could be a good idea.\nMeanwhile, the growing adoption of Amazon Web Services (AWS) is aiding Amazon\u2019s cloud dominance. In Q2 of 2024, Amazon and Google upped their cloud market share. \u201cGoogle is bigger than the next four largest players, while Microsoft is twice the size of Google and Amazon is 35 percent bigger than Microsoft,\u201d said John Dinsdale, chief analyst at Synergy Research Group in an email to CRN.\nA deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Amazon is developing its own processors to limit its reliance on costly NVIDIA chips. Amazon\u2019s Annapurna Labs, which it acquired in 2015, is spearheading the effort in this area. According to Sinno, the director of engineering at Annapurna Labs, there is a growing demand among Amazon\u2019s customers for cheaper alternatives to NVIDIA\u2019s chips, as quoted on Firstpost in July 2024.\nAmazon\u2019s stock trades at a price/earnings (trailing 12 months) ratio of 44.29X versus the underlying industry\u2019s P/E of 57.54X. However, Amazon\u2019s Price/Book (Most Recent Quarter) ratio is pricey. Amazon\u2019s P/B ratio is 8.30X versus the industry average of 2.02X. Amazon\u2019s price/cash flow (most recent fiscal year) ratio is 24.74X versus the industry average of 14.28X.\nAmazon\u2019s this year\u2019s growth rate is 63.45% versus the industry\u2019s growth rate of 13.20% and the S&P 500\u2019s 15.67%. Amazon\u2019s next year\u2019s growth rate is 23.21% versus the industry\u2019s growth rate of 23.10% and the S&P 500\u2019s 11.34%.\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 46 analysts, the average price target for Amazon comes to $225.98. The forecasts range from a low of $183.00 to a high of $265.00. The average price target represents an increase of 20.92% from the closing price of $186.89 recorded on Oct. 16, 2024.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGiven the ongoing uncertainties related to competition in the cloud and AI business, it may be better to track the company through an ETF approach. The basket approach minimizes the company-specific concentration risks. Amazon-heavy ETFs include the likes of Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY (weight 22.52%), ProShares Online Retail ETF ONLN (weight 22.33%) and Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF FDIS (weight 22.25%).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Jim Cramer Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks to Watch.\u00a0Since Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC talked about the latest rebound in the market.\n\u201cNever get tired of all-time highs. We are experiencing a time for the market which is what I said would happen when the Fed starts cutting rates when the economy is still solid.\u201d\nCramer said that the key reason the market roared to highs was strong earnings from top banks. He said since the Fed\u2019s interest rate cuts have just started, investors believe maybe the \u201cbest is yet to come.\u201d\nJim Cramer wondered whether this strong performance trend would be a \u201cpattern\u201d in this earnings season.\n\u201cWe will find out soon enough. We will see if the positive action will be sustained.\u201d\nCramer recommended investors to \u201clisten to the calls\u201d this earning season and \u201cponder a moment, and only then should you pull the trigger.\u201d\n\u201cWe are at the beginning of one of the year\u2019s four reporting periods. Probably the most exciting. I can\u2019t believe I still get fired up, but man, am I ever.\u201d\nFor this article, we watched the latest episodes of Jim Cramer\u2019s \u2018Lightning Round\u2019 segment on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he was talking about. With each company, we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nTtatty / Shutterstock.com\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\nTalking about an analyst downgrade on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Cramer questioned the logic of naysayers and said the company always makes a comeback.\n\u201cHow many times has Amazon been up against headwinds? Do you know how many times they\u2019ve made inexplicable moves? It is nothing new. They always came back; it is in their DNA. It always does. I remember a year and a half ago I was screaming because Amazon Web Services was underperforming, and it came right back.\u201d\nCramer thinks it\u2019s just a matter of time before the stock comes back.\n\u201cI think it is a matter of time before Amazon bounces back as usual. No hurry. The stock does seem to be headed lower; I have no doubt about that. I get it. But sell to buy it lower? Can you really get back in that? Too hard.\u201d\nAWS\u2019s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) continued growth is driven by its strong performance in AWS and advertising, which grew 19% and 20%, respectively. E-commerce growth moderated to 9.3%, likely due to softer consumer demand.\nOverall,\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Jim Cramer Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Spencer Soper ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Temu, locked in a fierce rivalry with Amazon.com Inc., is targeting one of the e-commerce giant\u2019s most popular product lines: the Fire TV streaming device.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City\u2019s Populous Outskirts\nSan Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes\nAs Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization\nChicago\u2019s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil\nChicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record\nTemu is selling Alexa-activated remote controls that are compatible with Amazon\u2019s Fire TV Stick for as little as $4. Similar generic versions cost about $10 on Amazon.com, while the official Fire TV replacement is about $25.\nSince emerging in 2022, Temu has challenged Amazon\u2019s speedy delivery guarantees by offering steep discounts to shoppers willing to wait about a week to receive their orders.\nThe knock-off Fire TV remotes are selling briskly, according to Temu\u2019s site, which gave the \u201cbest seller\u201d badge to one product described as a \u201creplacement Alexa Voice Remote Control\u201d that\u2019s compatible with Fire TV streaming devices.\nTemu shoppers purchased more than 75,000 units of the product, which had a 4.6-star rating from thousands of reviews. Many of the reviewers said the replacement looked exactly like the remotes that came with their Amazon streaming devices. The devices are provided by a China-based company called \u201cCilcone,\u201d according to the website.\n\u201cI was skeptical that this would work, but for the cost was willing to try,\u201d one review dated Aug. 16 states. \u201cAll I had to do was put batteries in, follow the instructions and within 30 seconds it was controlling my Fire Cube and TV.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Temu plans to carry other Fire TV-related gadgetry.\n\u201cThe products are sold by our third-party independent sellers,\u201d a Temu spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cSimilar products are widely available across various online marketplaces.\u201d\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the company is investigating the situation.\nTemu parent PDD Holdings Inc. in August spooked investors after warning that revenue growth will slow as it battles rivals chasing China\u2019s budget-conscious consumers. Challenges at home are making PDD more dependent on overseas markets like the US, where Temu is setting up its own delivery operation and actively wooing Amazon sellers.\nAbout 35% of all streaming media devices used in the US are made by Amazon, putting it No. 2 behind Roku, according to Parks Associates, a market research firm based in Addison, Texas. Amazon launched the Fire TV line of media players a decade ago and they\u2019ve become the company\u2019s best-selling products. Their remotes feature a button that directs viewers to Amazon\u2019s video streaming service, which helped it develop that business as well.\nAmazon has long been criticized for hurting its brand partners by creating generic versions of their products and undercutting them on price. The Seattle-based company has launched its own batteries, clothing, luggage, home goods and more. Amazon has favored its own products in search results over those sold by competitors, which violates antitrust rules, the Federal Trade Commission alleged in a lawsuit against the company last year.\nFour-dollar remotes could similarly undermine Amazon\u2019s Fire TV business, especially if Chinese factories start churning out other generic accessories. Some shoppers will take a gamble on the Temu remote to save money even if it\u2019s just a few dollars, said Rob Volpe, a consumer behavior expert in San Francisco.\n\u201cHistorically, the distribution channel for a brand is one of the key indicators to consumers of the premium nature or value of something,\u201d he said. \u201cTo see Amazon products show up on Temu looks a little weird and out of place, but I would say it isn\u2019t hurting the brand.\u201d\n(Updates with Temu comment in seventh paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nLina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes)\nWhy Is It So Hard for Clothing Resale Platforms to Make Money?\nMusk Reveals Why He\u2019s Jumping Into Trump\u2019s Arms\nChina Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space\nInside the Companies That Set Sports Gambling Odds\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Microsoft won't impose a new return-to-office mandate unless management concludes that productivity has dropped, a high-level exec has reportedly told workers.\nThe software and cloud-computing giant currently allows employees to work remotely, with many new hires promised the flexibility of working from home at least half the week. But that isn\u2019t written in stone.\nAccording to two anonymous sources that spoke with Business Insider, executive vice president Scott Guthrie recently told staff at his Microsoft\u2019s Cloud and AI group, which includes Azure, that a policy change isn\u2019t on the cards at present\u2014so long as workers stay productive.\nFortune has reached out to Microsoft requesting comment on what specific metric for productivity is used, how that would be benchmarked, and whether the process would be made transparent for employees.\nWhile no statement has been provided as of press time, Microsoft told Business Insider\u00a0that the company's work policies have not changed.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy\u2019s bombshell decree has roiled tech employees across the sector, many of whom dread a return to hours wasted in traffic jams on the long daily commute.\nThat\u2019s assuming a suitable branch office is even within driving distance for those who joined with the understanding they would work remotely on a permanent basis.\nAs a result a number of staff are now \u201crage applying\u201d for a new job, with some experts predicting Jassy and other execs like him will eventually be forced to backpedal amid widespread worker revolts.\nExperts have suggested RTO mandates may in fact be an excuse to elegantly trim staff numbers without restorting to severance by simply motivating employees to quit. According to a recent survey by anonymous job review site Blind, some 73% of verified Amazon professionals said they\u2019re considering quitting.\nThe RTO issue is contentious, and Jassy is by no means the most draconian CEO when it comes to the issue.\nElon Musk may very well be the most outspoken executive opposed to remote and hybrid work, having already ended the practice in June 2022 at Tesla. He suggested white-collar employees who want the continued flexibility remote and hybrid work offers were in fact simply lazy. \u201cThey should pretend to work somewhere else,\u201d he said in defense of his approach.\nThe entrepreneur, however, is only demanding the same attendance for his knowledge workers as his shop-floor workers, whom he required to show up in the middle of the pandemic\u2019s first wave. He branded what he called the \u201claptop class\u201d as out-of-touch elites that give off \u201creal Marie Antoinette vibes\u201d compared with the work ethic of their blue-collar brethren manning assembly lines.\nMusk may have had a point when it came to growing resentment over differing treatments within the workforce.\nU.S. dockworkers along the Eastern Seaboard and on the Gulf Coast are now going on strike for the first time since 1977, in a move that could cost the U.S. economy up to $4.5 billion every day. Striking port employees are demanding fair compensation from port operators for their efforts over the past six years including the pandemic.\n\u201cWhen [ports] made their most money was during COVID, when my men had to go to work on those piers every single day when everybody stayed home to go to work. Not my men; they died out there with the virus,\u201d said president Harold Daggett of the ILA trade union. \u201cNobody stayed home. Well, I want to be compensated for that.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Amazon, Google make dueling nuclear investments to power data centers with clean energy",
        "Author": "  ALEXA ST. JOHN and JENNIFER McDERMOTT ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) on Wednesday said that it was investing in small nuclear reactors, coming just two days after a similar announcement by Google (GOOG), as both tech giants seek new sources of carbon-free electricity to meet surging demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.\nThe plans come as the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant said last month it plans to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft can buy the power to supply its data centers. All three companies have been investing in solar and wind technologies, which make electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions. Now they say they need to go further in the search for clean electricity to meet both demand and their own commitments to cut emissions.\nNuclear energy is a climate solution in that its reactors don\u2019t emit the planet-warming greenhouse gases that come from power plants that burn fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and gas. The demand for power is surging globally as buildings and vehicles electrify. People used more electricity than ever last year, placing strain on electric grids around the world. Much of the demand also comes from data centers and artificial intelligence.\nThe International Energy Agency forecasts that data centers\u2019 total electricity consumption could reach more than 1,000 terawatt hours in 2026, more than doubling from 2022. Estimates suggest one terawatt hour can power 70,000 homes for a year.\n\u201cAI is driving a significant increase in the amount of data centers and power that are required on the grid,\u201d Kevin Miller, Amazon Web Services\u2019 vice president of global data centers, told The Associated Press, adding: \u201cWe view advanced new nuclear capacity as really key and essential.\"\nThe United States is pursuing small modular reactors, a type of nuclear reactor that can generate up to roughly one-third the amount of power of a traditional reactor. Developers say small reactors will be built faster and at a lower cost than large power reactors, scaling to fit needs of a particular location. They aim to start spinning up electricity in the early 2030s, if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gives permission to build and operate their designs and the technology succeeds.\nIf new, clean power isn\u2019t added as data centers are developed, the U.S. runs the risk of \u201cbrowning the grid,\u201d or including more power that isn't made from clean sources, said Kathryn Huff, a former U.S. assistant secretary for nuclear energy who is now an associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\nThe reactors are currently under development, with none currently providing power to the electric grid in the U.S. Big investors can help change that, and these announcements could be the \u201cinflection point\u201d that makes scaling up this technology truly possible, Huff said.\nJacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, echoed that, saying the industry needs customers who value the reliability and carbon-free attributes of nuclear and are willing to pay a premium for it at first, until a number of the next-generation reactors are deployed and the cost comes down.\nOn Monday, Google said it was signing a contract to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors that Kairos Power, a nuclear technology company, plans to develop.\nThe news highlights \u201cthe technologies that we\u2019re going to need to achieve round the clock clean energy, not only for Google but for the world,\u201d Michael Terrell, Google's senior director of energy and climate, told the AP.\nWith Kairos, Google said it expects to bring the first small modular reactor online by 2030, with more to come through 2035. The deal is projected to bring 500 megawatts of power to the grid. For context, Google consumed more than 24 terawatt hours of electricity last year, according to the company's annual environmental report. One terawatt is equal to 1,000,000 megawatts.\nMeanwhile, Amazon's announcements Wednesday included working with utility Dominion Energy to explore putting a small modular reactor near its existing North Anna nuclear power station in Virginia. It's investing in reactor developer X-energy for its early development work, and collaborating with regional utility Energy Northwest in central Washington to put four of the X-energy reactors there.\nCombined, the three announcements could account for more than 5,000 megawatts of power by the late 2030s with the possibility of more. All of that is still likely only a small fraction of the company\u2019s total energy consumption, a figure that Amazon does not report publicly.\nNew reactor designs pair well with industrial applications because they can be built on a small footprint and generate reliable power, with some able to provide high-temperature heat too, at the site, said Doug True, chief nuclear officer at the industry trade association, Nuclear Energy Institute.\n\u201cIt seems like a really good fit to support those facilities, and for a lot of different applications depending upon the amount of power that\u2019s needed by the customer,\u201d he said.\nBoth Amazon and Google have committed to using renewable energy to address climate change. By 2030, Google has pledged to meet net-zero emissions, and run carbon-free energy every hour of every day on every grid where it operates. It says it has already matched 100% of its global electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases on an annual basis. However, the company has fallen short on decreasing its emissions.\nAmazon has said it would match all of its global electricity consumption with 100% renewable energy by 2030, and recently announced it met that goal early in 2023. Though the company has matched its consumption as far as purchases of an equivalent amount of renewable energy, that does not necessarily mean it is using that to power its operations.\nAmazon saw its electricity emissions drop 11%, but direct emissions \u2014 known as Scope 1 \u2014 increased 7%, according to its 2023 sustainability report. The company is also targeting net zero-carbon by 2040.\n___\nRead more of AP\u2019s climate coverage at http://www.apnews.com/climate-and-environment\n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

        "Text": "Retailers are ramping up hiring for the holiday season, but fewer seasonal employees are expected to be taken on this year to help customers in stores and assemble online orders in warehouses.\nE-commerce giant Amazon said Thursday it will hire 250,000 full, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, rounding out a series of announcements made in recent weeks by the country\u2019s top retailers.\nAmazon is hiring the same number of employees it did last year, similar to Bath & Body Works and Target, which said in September it planned to bring in roughly 100,000 seasonal employees and offer current employees the option to work extra hours during the holiday shopping period.\nMeanwhile, the department store Kohl\u2019s encouraged people to apply for positions but stayed mum on its plans, mirroring Walmart, which said it\u2019s been hiring store associates throughout the year and will tap into its own staff when needed during the busy season.\nOthers have indicated they will scale back their holiday hiring. Macy\u2019s said it would add more than 31,500 seasonal positions this year across its Macy\u2019s, Bloomingdale\u2019s and Bluemercury stores, as well as its distribution centers. Last year, the company added 38,000.\nThis year's demand for seasonal workers comes as economists are watching the U.S. job market for signs of a slowdown. Job openings have come down steadily since peaking at 12.2 million in March 2022. When the economy roared back with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns, companies scrambled to find enough workers to keep up with customer orders.\nThe holiday shopping period is the busiest time of year for online and brick-and-mortar retailers, some of which have already announced discount events to entice consumers planning to shop early for gifts.\nThe consulting firm Deloitte forecasts U.S. retail sales will increase 2.3% to 3.3% between November and January and reach a total of $1.59 trillion. EY-Parthenon, the consulting arm of Ernst & Young, forecasts a similar 3% jump in sales during the traditional November-December period.\nHowever, EY Parthenon expects price increases due to inflation to account for a big chunk of that growth, saying real volume sales will only rise 0.5% year-over-year.\nOnline sales, a growing segment of retail, is expected to increase 8.4% and reach a record $240.8 billion, according to Adobe, which tracks e-commerce transactions.\n\u201cAt the moment, retailers appear optimistic for a strong holiday shopping season, which is being reflected in the hiring plans of major retailers and warehouses,\u201d said Andy Challenger, senior vice president at the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\nOverall, U.S. retailers are expected to add 520,000 new jobs in the final quarter of this year compared to 564,200 in 2023, according to a report released last month by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The firm, which analyzes non-seasonally adjusted data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, says that\u2019s more than the 509,300 seasonal jobs retailers added in 2022. But it represents the second-lowest total since 2009.\nGenerally, the labor market has gradually lost momentum since the Federal Reserve hiked its benchmark interest rate numerous times in 2022 and 2023 to combat high inflation. Last month, the Fed cut its key rate for the first time in more than four years. The move reflected its new focus on bolstering the job market.\nThe retail industry nevertheless may encounter challenges filling openings in the coming weeks and months \u201cdue to the demands of the job and pay,\u201d Challenger said.\nTo scoop up employees, companies like Macy\u2019s and JCPenney as well as sporting goods stores Bass Pro Shops and Cabela\u2019s are recruiting workers through nationwide hiring events. JCPenney plans to hire more than 10,000 store associates, roughly the same as last year. Macy\u2019s said it would offer on-the-spot interviews during its first event, which took place last week in its stores and warehouses. The company plans to hold three more events this year.\n\u201cWe are finding strong application flow,\u201d Macy\u2019s said, adding that nearly a third of its recent hires were people who had worked at the company before.\nAmid the growth in online shopping, the delivery giant UPS said it planned to hire 125,000 seasonal workers for the holiday rush, up from 100,000 last year.\nRadial, an e-commerce company that powers deliveries for brands like Calvin Klein and Express, said it intended to hire fewer people but also planned to scale its staff based on real-time demand. That approach allows the company to meet customers' needs \u201cwithout overcommitting,\" said Billy Peterson, a senior vice president at Radial.\nOn the buyer side, consumers have been resilient with their spending while also showing signs of stress, with credit-card debt rising and savings rates falling, trends that could weigh on spending in future months.\nRetail sales ticked up from July to August, after jumping the most in a year and a half the previous month. At the same time, consumers have been more prudent about their purchases and pushing back against high prices by trading down to store brands or seeking out deals for products.\nHowever, holiday shoppers could see even higher prices on products if a port workers\u2019 strike that has shut down all the major dockyards on the Eastern seaboard of the U.S. and the Gulf coast persists for more than a month.\n"

        "Title": "Amazon\u2019s RTO charge is just layoffs in disguise, experts say",
        "Author": "  Sasha Rogelberg ",
        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s return-to-office policy announced last month, mandating employees work in person five days a week starting in 2025, already has workers irritated. Some have even begun \u201crage-applying\u201d to new positions, wanting to stick it to the tech company. The trouble for them is that could be exactly the response Amazon was hoping for.\nThe tech mammoth\u2019s strict RTO push might just be a sneaky means of laying off workers, some future-of-work experts say. Amazon likely already knows the new policy will nudge dissatisfied workers out, meaning the company will no longer have to go through the tough process of formal layoffs. As a tradeoff, the RTO crusade could come at the expense of the company\u2019s own talent and tech advancements.\n\"Amazon presumably took the view they would rather control costs by cutting head count and take the hit of technology and innovation,\" Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom told Business Insider.\nThe company may be content with making the sacrifice of some brain drain. The RTO crackdown came in tandem with CEO Andy Jassy calling for a reduction in managers and a bump in the ratio of workers to managers by 15% by the end of 2025\u2019s first quarter. Amazon said its RTO shift is an effort to strengthen company culture and that the company has no plans to reduce its headcount.\nBrian Elliott, future-of-work advisor and author of How the Future Works: Leading Flexible Teams to Do the Best Work of Their Lives, agreed with Bloom. He told Fortune Amazon will \u201cundoubtedly\u201d see employee attrition as a result of the mandate because it continues to be widely unpopular among most U.S. workers.\n\u201cThe vast majority of people want something that is in the middle: They want a couple days a week together that are meaningful with their teams,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, by the way, those people the flexibility is taken away from are much more likely to jump ship.\u201d\nA study from human resources consulting firm Robert Half conducted last month revealed 39% of office workers in Australia would quit if their company slashed flexible working. Amazon employees are already bolstering that statistic. Anonymous job review site Blind, which surveyed 2,585 verified Amazon workers a day after Jassy\u2019s RTO announcement, found that 73% of employees considered quitting their jobs as a result of the mandate.\nThese \u201cbackdoor layoffs,\u201d as Bloom refers to them, have already made a splash in other workplaces. According to research by BambooHR published in May surveying over 1,500 U.S. managers, about a quarter of executives said they hoped employees would voluntarily leave the company after the implementation of an RTO mandate. When AT&T mandated its 60,000 workers across nine of its 350 offices work in person again, some employees interpreted the push as a way to eliminate workers unable or uninterested in relocating to their offices. CEO John Stankey estimated that 15% of the affected workforce, about 9,000 employees, would face the choice of relocating or leaving the company altogether.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a layoff wolf in return-to-office sheep\u2019s clothing,\u201d an anonymous AT&T employee told Bloomberg.\nThe sneaky layoff strategy hasn\u2019t always worked out for employers. Almost half of employers that implemented RTO policies saw a greater than anticipated level of employee attrition, according to a 2023 report from Unispace. Almost 30% reported recruitment difficulties.\nAmazon will face this same risk, Elliott argued. Other tech companies may keep their flexible work policies as a means to poach Amazon\u2019s talent, and Amazon may struggle to hire new faces, he said. This talent pool shrinks even more for women, who may need flexibility for child care, and managers, who can leverage experience to find a cushier job elsewhere.\n\u201cYou lose a set of people in your organization,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cYou lose high performance.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Amazon DSP Announces Next-Generation Ad Tech for Precise Full-funnel Reach and Performance",
        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "Amazon unveils an all-new Amazon DSP experience, enhanced interoperability, and simplified full-funnel optimization\nAUSTIN, Texas, October 15, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(NASDAQ: AMZN) \u2014 At unBoxed 2024, Amazon Ads announced a series of innovations across the Amazon Demand-side Platform (Amazon DSP) that drive precise full-funnel audience reach with streamlined campaign planning and optimization. Amazon Ads has a unique, deep understanding of the path customers take from awareness to conversion and is delivering capabilities that all brands can easily use to create and strengthen relationships with their customers, regardless of the size of their business, their products, or which services they sell.\n\"The digital advertising landscape is rapidly evolving, with streaming TV becoming mainstream and full-funnel, cross-channel reach and measurement taking center stage. We\u2019re inventing ad tech that makes it easier for all advertisers to navigate this evolution with precise reach, deeper insights, and direct measurement,\" said Kelly MacLean, Vice President of Amazon DSP. \"Amazon DSP can uniquely drive top-to-bottom outcomes on Amazon\u2019s properties, such as the store and Prime Video, as well as across leading streaming apps and premium publishers. We look forward to seeing advertisers leverage the capabilities announced today to fuel their business growth and engage more customers.\"\nImproved usability and ease of use\nTo increase advertiser efficiency, Amazon DSP is launching a new user experience with simplified workflows to enable campaign creation in just a few clicks. In early tests, the new consolidated display line-item feature reduced campaign setup time by 75%. This feature brings together desktop, mobile, and app display inventory into a single line item, making it easier to launch and monitor reporting.\nWhen advertisers visit their campaign health overview page, they will now see new insight cards and machine learning recommendations that help them quickly audit their campaign performance and make adjustments. For example, an advertiser may see an insight card that shows their campaign is currently underdelivering; they can review the accompanying recommendation and click to automatically apply that optimization. Amazon DSP will centralize and expand these cards within a new campaign management hub in 2025.\nAmazon DSP enhancements also include new frequency cap controls and reporting to simplify frequency management. Advertisers can now use the frequency groups feature to holistically manage their frequency caps across multiple campaigns, channels and devices\u2014such as capping ad frequency at a household level. Advertisers using these frequency cap controls have saved up to 26% of their campaign budgets from spending on duplicate impressions and drove up to 21% incremental reach.\n\"Amazon DSP's frequency management and target frequency capabilities exceed those of other DSPs. In particular, the frequency cap insights report is the most thought-through report we have seen among all DSPs,\" said Megan Pagliuca, Chief Activation Officer, Omnicom Media Group.\nEnhanced interoperability across Amazon ad tech\nAmazon Ads is also launching an ads data manager. This easy-to-use interface enables advertisers to securely upload their signals once, and then use them across Amazon DSP and Amazon Marketing Cloud (AMC) to engage relevant audiences, measure conversions, and optimize campaigns. It\u2019s integrated with providers like Treasure Data, Salesforce, and Tealium, so advertisers can import their first-party data from wherever they store it. Today advertisers can use ads data manager to connect their first-party data with Amazon DSP audiences, and it will be fully integrated with the Amazon DSP and AMC in 2025.\nThrough the powerful combination of AMC, Amazon DSP, and Amazon Publisher Cloud, advertisers are now able to create custom audiences tailored to their business goals, then overlay them with signals from Amazon Ads and third-party publishers to increase their efficacy. This direct collaboration creates a new way for advertisers to launch enhanced deals with premium third-party publishers using their custom audiences\u2014enriched with precise signals from the publisher and Amazon Ads to increase relevancy and campaign performance.\nXmars recently activated a campaign for Bedsure with AMC audiences and Amazon Publisher Cloud, which were enhanced with publisher-signals from a leading publisher, resulting in a 2.2X uplift in reach among the brand\u2019s desired audiences. It also had an approximately 50% more efficient cost to reach their desired customers. \"Ensuring that media dollars are driving maximum results is a top priority for our clients,\" said Tony Wang, Xmars Co-founder. \"We\u2019re able to unlock even more value on Amazon DSP using our brand partners' proprietary data in secure collaboration with Amazon Ads signals plus insights from top broadcasters to create enriched deals. This increases the effectiveness of our campaigns across the funnel and delivers even greater value for advertisers.\"\nSimplified campaign optimization with AI-driven performance\nAmazon Ads also announced enhancements to Performance+, the always-on, automated optimization capability within Amazon DSP. Performance+ uses advertiser-provided signals and predictive AI to automate audience relevancy and campaign optimization for lower-funnel goals, like conversion and customer acquisition. It sets up campaigns, builds custom audiences, and continuously optimizes toward the advertiser\u2019s stated KPIs. Results to date show that Performance+ drive a 51% improvement in customer acquisition costs, on average.\nNew Performance+ tactics, now in open beta, expand advertiser campaign strategies to include remarketing and retention, in addition to the prospecting tactic that was already available. The entire workflow has been streamlined to as few as four clicks, while still providing flexible optimization controls and transparency. Advertisers simply choose their campaign goal, such as conversion, awareness, or consideration; choose their KPI, such as cost-per-acquisition (CPA) or return on ad spend (ROAS); and choose their Performance+ tactic: prospecting, remarketing, or retention. Performance+ campaigns continually optimize performance against these specifications to deliver the right results.\nFiverr, a company connecting businesses with freelancers, used the Performance+ prospecting tactic to drive automated performance. Within a month, Fiverr saw a 66% reduction in CPA vs. goal target and a 72% increase in click through rate vs. campaign average benchmarks.\nTo learn more about all of the announcements at unBoxed 2024, go to ads.amazon.com.\nAbout Amazon Ads\nAmazon Ads offers full-funnel advertising solutions to help businesses of all sizes achieve their marketing goals at scale. Amazon Ads connects advertisers to highly relevant audiences through first-party insights; extensive reach across premium content like Prime Video, Twitch, and third-party publishers; the ability to connect and directly measure campaign tactics across awareness, consideration, and conversion; and generative AI to deliver appropriate creative at each step.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Companies including Amazon.com Inc. and Woodside Energy Group Ltd. announced projects in Mexico totaling about $20 billion, a victory for President Claudia Sheinbaum as she seeks to attract investment from wary business leaders.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHow Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought\nInside the \u2018Utopias\u2019 of Mexico City\nDubai\u2019s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City\u2019s Infrastructure\nMexico Seeks to Halve Permitting Time to Attract More Factories\nWhat It Takes to Make City Solutions Go Viral\nEconomy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Woodside plans to invest $10.4 billion to develop a deepwater project with state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos in the Gulf of Mexico. Amazon will spend $6 billion through 2026 to strengthen its network and digital capacity in the country, he said.\nRoyal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. is planning a $1.5 billion tourist project in Quintana Roo state, Ebrard said in a news conference after a meeting of the US-Mexico CEO Dialogue on Tuesday.\nAddressing the leaders of about 240 Mexican and foreign companies, Sheinbaum sought to downplay concerns that a series of constitutional reforms will diminish democracy and judicial independence in the country, the largest trading partner of the US.\nAmong those reforms are a judicial overhaul approved last month in Congress to elect federal judges by popular vote and an energy bill to give state-owned companies priority over private firms in energy generation and power transmission. Critics have said the judicial changes make investment in Mexico riskier because control of the courts is likely to go to Sheinbaum\u2019s popular Morena party.\n\u201cThe president doesn\u2019t want to control the judiciary,\u201d Sheinbaum said. \u201cWhat we want is to have a judiciary free of corruption.\u201d\nSheinbaum also said that, although the government wants to control 54% of energy generation and transmission in Mexico, there will be clear rules for private investment in the remaining 46%. During the CEO meeting, the government created working groups with companies to address energy projects.\nThe government will have its energy plan ready by the end of the year, Sheinbaum said. A set of rules known as secondary laws will define the participation process of private companies in energy projects.\nAfter listening to businesses concerns, the government will create a digital transformation agency to reduce red tape and help companies with investment projects, Sheinbaum said.\nThe North American free-trade pact known as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, must be strengthened so that the three countries complement each other rather than compete with each other, she said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhy OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man\nHow Starbucks\u2019 Colorful, Sugary Drinks Turned Kids Into Customers for Life\nWhen a Miracle Cure Is Left on the Shelf\nThe World\u2019s Central Banks Aren\u2019t Following the Fed\u2019s Lead Anymore\nWhen a Robot Really Isn\u2019t a Robot\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s five-day return-to-office order sent shock waves throughout the company and the broader business world last month. On Tuesday, Whole Foods CEO Jason Buechel stepped up to the mic to assuage employee concerns at the Amazon-owned grocery chain.\nSaying he wanted Whole Foods employees to feel incentivized rather than bludgeoned into coming to the office every day, Buechel touted initiatives such as an \u201coffice experience task force\u201d during a special meeting to address the RTO policy.\n\u201cI want us to figure out, how do we find the win-win overall in supporting Whole Foods Market, our team members, our customers, and beyond,\u201d Buechel said in the all-hands meeting on Tuesday, a recording of which was reviewed by Fortune.\n\u201cOur goal here is not to make this seem like this is a stick,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want to help create and work with our team members [in] having the carrot and getting the excitement about bringing back the culture and ultimately the interactions that we once had in our offices across the company.\u201d\nBuechel said that his leadership team fielded 1,200 questions in advance of the meeting, which lasted a little less than an hour. Three employees attending the meeting in person were also given the mic to ask questions.\nThe town hall comes two weeks after Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that his company, which bought Whole Foods in 2017, would return to a full five days in office on Jan. 2, 2025, after nearly five years of remote and hybrid work at Amazon and its subsidiaries. Whole Foods spokesperson Rachel Malish only confirmed that Whole Foods staff will abide by the new Amazon mandate but did not respond to Fortune\u2019s questions about the staff meeting.\nJassy\u2019s announcement came across as a tacit acknowledgement of a fraying corporate culture inside Amazon in recent years, as Fortune recently chronicled. Jassy also noted that Amazon would look to thin out middle management and the bureaucracy that the CEO believes comes from too much of it, by reducing the ratio of middle managers to individual employees by 15%. One Whole Foods employee on Tuesday questioned leadership about how such a cut would be carried out at the organic grocery store chain. But Whole Foods HR exec Brian O\u2019Connell told employees that that number is just a \u201ctarget\u201d and that the grocer has already \u201cdone a lot of good work\u201d in reducing this ratio over the past year.\n\u201cI don\u2019t imagine we\u2019re going to make a 15% reduction,\u201d he said.\nAmong the other queries employees had for management were questions about why Whole Foods workers should have to follow Amazon\u2019s mandate when their compensation doesn\u2019t always match that of their parent company counterparts, to whether the move was intended to force staff out, to how leadership plans to deal with a potential brain drain.\nLeadership offered vague answers to many questions\u2014\u201cfreedom within a framework of a norm of an office-based culture\u201d was one phrase from a Whole Foods marketing exec that especially rankled employees\u2014and failed to explain how five days in office would fix problems that three days in person couldn\u2019t. But Buechel was adamant that the mandate was not meant as an alternative to layoffs and that there would be flexibility to work from home when requiring quiet time to hit a deadline or if an unexpected personal need requires it.\nBuechel and other company executives pointed to efforts such as the creation of a new \u201coffice experience task force\u201d made up of employees across company divisions who would be charged with brainstorming ideas to help staff transition from their current three-day hybrid structure to a new \u201coffice-based culture.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are things that we can do to make it exciting to come here and experience and work with our team members day in, day out?\u201d the CEO asked rhetorically.\nThe responsibility of figuring out how this balancing act will work will fall to individual managers, Buechel said. As for the company tracking how often employees badge into the office, which Jassy said would continue during the transition to full in-office work, the Whole Foods CEO said it would continue for now, but \u201cmy goal is to get rid of this\u201d if employees \u201cwork responsibly.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want us to be in this space,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to seem like we are punching a clock from 8 to 5. And I don\u2019t want to be in a spot where we are tracking this.\u201d\nAre you a current or former Whole Foods employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

Amazon says the expansion will more than double the number of cities where customers can get same-day delivery of their medications.\nAs part of the expansion, Amazon is opening new pharmacies that will include Amazon Same-Day Delivery sites to enable faster medication delivery in the 20 new cities.\nThe expansion, which aims to make quick medication delivery available in almost half of the U.S., marks Amazon's latest efforts to accelerate its healthcare services.\nAlthough Amazon didn't reveal the full list of the 20 new cities, the company said customers in Boston, Dallas, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and San Diego will get access to the same-day medication delivery service. Amazon says it will announce additional cities in the coming months.\nAmazon's same-day medication delivery is already available in New York, Los Angeles, Indianapolis, Miami, Phoenix, Seattle, and Austin.\nAmazon says Amazon Pharmacy customers already receive their medications in two days or less on average. By the end of 2025, 45% of U.S. customers will be eligible for Same-Day delivery of their medications, the company says, which means that a customer can order medication by 4 p.m. and have it delivered by 10 p.m.\nThe company launched Amazon Pharmacy in 2020 after it purchased online pharmacy PillPack in 2018. Last year, Amazon launched RxPass, a service that offers Prime members in the U.S. as many generic versions of medications as they need for a $5 monthly fee.\nIn addition to same-day medication delivery, Amazon Pharmacy has been offering drone deliveries in College Station, Texas, since January 2023.

        "Author": "  Muslim Farooque ",
        "Text": "SEATTLE The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that eCommerce behemoth Amazon (AMZN, Financials) has struck a five-year agreement with Databricks, a key Snowflake (SNOW, Financials) rival, to effectively set up a data warehouse startup to utilize Amazon's Trainium AI processors. Though the specifics weren't revealed, the deal will likely assist businesses in developing AI in cost-cutting efforts.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with SNOW.\nMoreover, Databricks president Naveen Rao highlighted how the partnership will allow companies to build AI models significantly quicker and more inexpensively effectively. This is primarily because of the savings from utilizing Amazon's Trainium processors instead of those from Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), which spearheads the AI chip space.\nAlso, it's noteworthy that Databricks will continue using Nvidia processors as part of a pre-existing agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS), notwithstanding the change. Along with its Inferentia series of AI chips used to develop and operate AI models, Amazon debuted the second iteration of its Trainium chips in November last year. All in all the agreement adds to Amazon's position in the cutthroat AI chip space, as it looks to advance its position further.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nTwo years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nAmid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.\nAs semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

It is also positive on the company's ability to monetize its artificial intelligence investments. The investment firm expects corporate uses, streamlining customer interactions, speeding code development, storing and contextualizing unstructured data, and other business efficiencies to be the most substantial near- to medium-term opportunities.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

It also found slime products containing levels of a chemical called boron over 13 times the EU\u2019s legal limit. Boron can cause reproductive health problems, TIE noted.\nThe study\u2019s results \u201cdo not reflect the safety of all toys available on these platforms,\u201d the group said, noting that it had not bought any toys from well-known brands.\nThe EU has the \u201cstrictest toy safety regime in the world\u201d but toymakers from outside the bloc are exempt from EU rules when selling their products via online marketplaces, TIE said.\nSix of the 10 online marketplaces studied, including Amazon, have signed the EU\u2019s Product Safety Pledge, a voluntary commitment to ensure the safety of the goods sold on their platforms by third parties, the industry body added, urging EU leaders to make such marketplaces legally responsible for the safety of products listed by third parties.\nIn the United States, too, regulators are concerned about the safety of goods sold online. In September, two officials from the Consumer Products Safety Commission called for an investigation into Shein and Temu over the potential sale of \u201cdeadly baby and toddler products.\u201d\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Title": "Jeff Bezos Says 'All Overnight Success Takes 10 Years' \u2013 Amazon Didn't Turn A Profit For Almost A Decade",
        "Author": "  Jeannine Mancini ",
        "Text": "Jeff Bezos famously said in a 2018 CNBC interview, \"All overnight success takes about 10 years,\" perfectly summing up Amazon's long journey from an online bookstore to one of the most valuable companies in the world.\nHis statement reflects that real success isn't instant, and Amazon's story is a prime example. Despite its current dominance, Amazon's path to profitability was slow, filled with financial losses, skepticism and hard work.\nDon't Miss:\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year \u2014 for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nAmazon was founded in 1994 with a focus on selling books online. At the time, the internet was still relatively new, and the concept of e-commerce was far from mainstream. From the outset, Bezos had a vision for Amazon's future that extended well beyond books. However, that vision wasn't immediately profitable.\nFor years, Amazon posted losses, and it wasn't until 2003 \u2013 almost a full decade later \u2013 that Amazon finally turned a full-year profit. That year, the company reported a net income of $35 million, a significant turnaround from the $149 million loss it had posted just the year before. This slow climb to profitability aligns perfectly with Bezos' statement about the 10-year overnight success.\nTrending: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nThe road to that first profit wasn't easy. In the early 2000s, many were skeptical of Amazon's future. The company was expanding rapidly, moving beyond books and into new product categories and investing heavily in infrastructure. While these moves were essential to its growth, they were costly, leading to years of financial losses. Still, Bezos remained focused on the long term. He wasn't interested in short-term gains or quick profits. Instead, he prioritized growth and customer satisfaction, even if that meant operating at a loss for years.\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nIn a talk at the Internet Association\u2019s gala in 2017, as reported by CNBC, Bezos explained his forward-thinking approach: \"When someone congratulates Amazon on its financial quarter, I am thinking to myself those quarterly results were pretty much fully baked about three years ago.\" This long-term mindset was crucial to Amazon's eventual success.\nBezos understood that today\u2019s work might not pay off immediately, but it would bear fruit. His willingness to think years ahead rather than focus on short-term profits set Amazon apart from many of its competitors.\nTrending: A billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\nA key part of Amazon's strategy during those unprofitable years was its commitment to innovation. The company continually explored new ideas, took risks and learned from failures. Bezos believed in the importance of \"high-quality failures\" \u2013 mistakes that stem from bold, calculated risks rather than operational errors.\nThis philosophy encouraged innovation and allowed Amazon to adapt to the ever-changing market. This willingness to experiment and take risks led to the development of services like Amazon Prime and Amazon Web Services (AWS), both of which are now integral to the company's success.\nTrending: These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion \u2013 they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\nToday, Amazon's dominance in multiple industries \u2013 retail, cloud computing and entertainment \u2013 seems almost inevitable. But looking back, it's clear that the company's journey was anything but guaranteed. Bezos' 10-year overnight success statement reminds us that the road to success is often long and challenging. The early years of financial losses and uncertainty were necessary for Amazon's growth, allowing the company to lay the groundwork for its future success.\nTrending: Beating the market through ethical real estate investing' \u2014 this platform aims to give tenants equity in the homes they live in while scoring 17.17% average annual returns for investors \u2013 here\u2019s how to join with just $100\nBezos' perspective is particularly relevant in today's world, where there's a strong emphasis on quick wins and instant results. Many entrepreneurs and business leaders consider Amazon's story a reminder that building something great takes time. It's not just about making money fast; it's about creating a strong foundation, taking risks and staying committed to a long-term vision.\nAmazon's success story offers valuable lessons for anyone looking to build something meaningful. While it's easy to focus on the company\u2019s current position, its early years tell a much more complex story \u2013 one of persistence, innovation and a relentless focus on the future.\nBezos' \"10-year overnight success\" is a reminder that real success doesn't happen overnight. It's built over time through hard work, strategic planning and a willingness to take risks. Today, Bezos' net worth is $204.4 billion, making him the fourth-richest man globally.\nRead Next:\nTeens may never need wisdom teeth removed thanks to this MedTech Company \u2013 Be an early investor for just $300 for 100 shares!\nStudies show 50% of consumers think Financial Advisors cost much more than they do \u2014 to debunk this, this company provides matching for free and a complimentary first call with the matched advisor.\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

This support from tech giants could help Harris at the polls.\nEmployees at Amazon, notably corporate employees, have donated more to political campaigns than have employees at other large retail organizations, including Walmart, Reuters reported.\nTrump Wants To Eliminate Income Taxes: How Would That Impact You If You Are Retired?\nAlthough there are no public reports of Bezos donating directly to the Harris campaign in 2024, a look at his donation history at OpenSecrets indicates he has donated thousands to Democrats in the past (with a few donations to Republicans, as well).\nAdditionally, due to a software glitch, Amazon Alexa devices reportedly gave a glowing recommendation for Harris as the next U.S. President while refusing to endorse any political party or leader when users asked for reasons to vote for Trump. The error was quickly fixed, however, as videos circulated the internet in early September.\nAdditionally, an exclusive report from Variety revealed that Amazon is in talks with news anchor Brian Williams to host a live Election Night special on Amazon Prime Video. The goal, according to Variety, is to \u201chave a non-partisan discussion of the evening\u2019s events.\u201d\nHowever, given Amazon\u2019s track record for backing Democratic candidates, this coverage, if it occurs, could sway voters at the last minute and potentially steer election results.\nBezos is not the only Silicon Valley tech giant or billionaire to support Harris. Melinda French Gates and Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings donated to Harris\u2019 campaign, with the latter giving $7 million, according to a report at The Information.\nShark Tank investor Mark Cuban also voiced his support for Harris as President, sharing in an X post, \u201cShe is pro-business. She is more supportive of entrepreneurs than any other candidate in recent memory. It\u2019s only going to get better.\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note on election coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- Wells Fargo downgraded Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Equal Weight from Overweight in a note to clients on Monday, citing multiple headwinds that are likely to pause the company's positive earnings revision story.\nThe bank also lowered its price target for the stock to $183 from $225, highlighting challenges that may limit Amazon's operating income (OI) growth through 2027.\nAccording to Wells Fargo, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains strong, it is \"not enough\" to drive positive estimate revisions in the near term.\nSeveral factors, including investments in Project Kuiper, pressure from Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees, and moderating advertising contributions, are expected to weigh on Amazon's earnings growth.\nThe firm warns that \"margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well\" and that the company is unlikely to see the resumption of positive revisions until its July 2025 guidance.\n\"While the market is more prepared for pressure on 4Q OI, we caution that margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well. As such, we move to Equal Weight until visibility into margin expansion resumes,\" writes Wells Fargo.\nWells Fargo reduced its OI estimates for Amazon by $5.4 billion, $4.5 billion, and $5.5 billion for 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively, attributing these cuts to slower monetization of merchant services and advertising.\n\"Amazon remains a margin expansion story,\" Wells Fargo noted, adding that the pace of this expansion will likely be more moderate than the market currently expects.\nThe report also points to increasing competition from Walmart (NYSE:WMT)'s expanding fulfillment services, which are now priced 15% cheaper than Amazon's FBA offering.\nWells Fargo believes Walmart's growing fulfillment capabilities could exert pressure on Amazon's fees and merchant services.\nGiven the challenges, Wells Fargo sees limited visibility into Amazon's earnings recovery in the short term and, hence, lowered its price target and rating on the stock.\nRelated Articles\nAmazon downgraded at Wells Fargo as 'positive revision story on pause'\nIndia stocks lower at close of trade; Nifty 50 down 0.87%\nHIms & Hers shares rise premarket on upcoming inclusion in S&P SmallCap 600\n"

        "Author": "  Greg Bensinger ",
        "Text": "By Greg Bensinger\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon on Wednesday announced its first color Kindle e-reader following years of effort to bring the more immersive device to market.\nThe 'Kindle Colorsoft' carries a $280 price tag that compares with similar devices from other manufacturers available on Amazon in the range of $149 to $330. The Colorsoft relies on LEDs and other technologies to achieve the color display, according to a company statement.\nAmazon had tried in prior years to develop color e-readers using eInk -- the technology available in its standard Kindles that requires minimal battery power. The Colorsoft will have a roughly eight-week battery life, compared with up to three months for its latest generation Paperwhite e-reader.\nThe Seattle retailer also unveiled a new Paperwhite with a 7-inch screen, measured diagonally, two-tenths of an inch larger than the most recent generation's. It also revealed an updated Kindle Scribe e-reader, which allows users to jot onto the screen with a stylus and convert that into more legible text.\nUsers' in-book notations can be summarized by artificial intelligence software that can convert pages of notes into bullet points, the company said.\nAmazon is still the market leader in e-readers, commanding more than three quarters of the market, by some measures. The devices are built to last for years and the company has said it sells them for close to cost, making money when people purchase books or other reading materials.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic fueled a surge in e-reader use, as many libraries stayed closed to enforce shelter-in-place policies but still offered wireless downloads of e-books.\nKindles are often put on sale during discount events, such as Prime Day. The Colorsoft will ship to customers on Oct. 30 and the new Scribe will ship on Dec. 4.\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; Editing by Rashmi Aich)\n"

        "Author": "  Radek Strnad ",
        "Text": "Quarterly earnings results are a good time to check in on a company\u2019s progress, especially compared to its peers in the same sector. Today we are looking at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and the best and worst performers in the online retail industry.\nConsumers ever rising demand for convenience, selection, and speed are secular engines underpinning ecommerce adoption. For years prior to Covid, ecommerce penetration as a percentage of overall retail would grow 1-2% annually, but in 2020 adoption accelerated by 5%, reaching 25%, as increased emphasis on convenience drove consumers to structurally buy more online. The surge in buying caused many online retailers to rapidly grow their logistics infrastructures, preparing them for further growth in the years ahead as consumer shopping habits continue to shift online.\nThe 6 online retail stocks we track reported a slower Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 0.6% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 1.3% below.\nBig picture, the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate of inflation and employment. The former had been running hot throughout 2021 and 2022 but cooled towards the central bank's 2% target as of late. This prompted the Fed to cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024. Given recent employment data that suggests the US economy could be wobbling, the markets will be assessing whether this rate and future cuts (the Fed signaled more to come in 2024 and 2025) are the right moves at the right time or whether they're too little, too late for a macro that has already cooled.\nLuckily, online retail stocks have performed well with share prices up 15.7% on average since the latest earnings results.\nFounded by Jeff Bezos after quitting his stock-picking job at D.E. Shaw, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s largest online retailer and provider of cloud computing services.\nAmazon reported revenues of $148 billion, up 10.1% year on year. This print was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, but overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 earnings estimates but revenue guidance for next quarter missing analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon President & CEO.\nThe market was likely pricing in the results, and the stock is flat since reporting. It currently trades at $184.58.\nIs now the time to buy Amazon? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it\u2019s free.\nKnown for its glass tower car vending machines, Carvana (NYSE:CVNA) provides a convenient automotive shopping experience by offering an online platform for buying and selling used cars.\nCarvana reported revenues of $3.41 billion, up 14.9% year on year, outperforming analysts\u2019 expectations by 4.6%. Overall, the business had a strong quarter.\nCarvana delivered the biggest analyst estimates beat among its peers. The market seems happy with the results as the stock is up 31.2% since reporting.

It was a disappointing quarter as it posted a miss of analysts\u2019 buyer estimates and slow revenue growth.\nWayfair delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group. The company reported 22 million active buyers, up 0.9% year on year. As expected, the stock is down 3% since the results and currently trades at $52.80.\nRead our full analysis of Wayfair\u2019s results here. \nLaunched in 2003 by software engineers Michael Mente and Mike Karanikolas, Revolve Group (NASDAQ: RVLV) is a next generation fashion retailer that leverages social media and a community of fashion influencers to drive its merchandising strategy.\nRevolve reported revenues of $282.5 million, up 3.2% year on year. This print surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations by 1.9%. Taking a step back, it was a mixed quarter as it also recorded a decent beat of analysts\u2019 buyer estimates but slow revenue growth.\nThe company reported 2.58 million active buyers, up 4.8% year on year.

        "Author": "  Timothy Gardner ",
        "Text": "By Timothy Gardner\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Amazon.com said on Wednesday it has signed three agreements on developing the nuclear power technology called small modular reactors, becoming the latest big tech company to push for new sources to meet surging electricity demand from data centers.\nAmazon said it will fund a feasibility study for an SMR project near a Northwest Energy site in Washington state. The SMR is planned to be developed by X-Energy. Financial details were not disclosed.\nUnder the agreement, Amazon will have the right to purchase electricity from four modules. Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, will have the option to add up to eight 80 MW modules, resulting in a total capacity up to 960 MWs, or enough to power the equivalent of more than 770,000 U.S. homes. The additional power would be available to Amazon and utilities to power homes and businesses.\n\"Our agreements will encourage the construction of new nuclear technologies that will generate energy for decades to come,\" said Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services.\nSMRs will have their components built in a factory to reduce construction costs. Today's larger reactors are built onsite. Critics of SMRs say they will be too expensive to achieve the desired economies of scale.\nNuclear power, which generates electricity virtually free of greenhouse gas emissions and provides high-paying union jobs, gets wide support from both Democrats and Republicans.\nBut no U.S. SMRs exist yet. NuScale, the only U.S. company with an SMR design license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, last year had to axe the first SMR project to build its technology at a U.S. lab in Idaho.\nIn addition, SMRs will produce long-lasting radioactive nuclear waste for which the U.S. does not yet have a final repository.\nScott Burnell, a spokesperson at the U.S. NRC, said \"no specifics\" about the planned SMRs been presented yet to the regulator.\nDATA CENTERS\nTech firms have signed a rash of agreements with nuclear companies this year as artificial intelligence boosts U.S. power demand for the first time in decades, though time-lines for nuclear projects tend to lag goals by years.\nU.S. data center power use is expected to roughly triple between 2023 and 2030 and will require about 47 gigawatts of new generation capacity, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. Goldman assumed natural gas, wind and solar power would fill the gap.\nAmazon said it is also leading a funding round for $500 million to support X-Energy\u2019s development of SMRs. Amazon and X-Energy aim to bring more than 5 gigawatts online in the United States by 2039, which the companies call the largest commercial deployment target of SMRs yet.\nAmazon also signed an agreement with Dominion Energy to explore the development of an SMR project near the utility's existing power station in Virginia. The about 300 megawatt project would help meet power needs in a region where demand is expected to jump 85% in 15 years, Dominion said.\nU.S. Senator Mark Warner said at an event held at Amazon offices in Virginia that recent announcements could \"crack the code\" in getting U.S. SMRs built. Warner said he often talks with parties in other countries who are interested in buying SMRs from U.S. companies but wary that none have been built in the U.S.\nOn Monday Alphabet's Google signed an agreement with Kairos Power to bring an SMR online by 2030, with more deployments through 2035.\nIn March, Amazon purchased a nuclear-powered datacenter from Talen Energy. Last month, Microsoft and Constellation Energy signed a power deal to help resurrect a unit of the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, the site of the worst U.S. nuclear accident in 1979.\n(Reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by David Gregorio and Franklin Paul)\n"

Amazon and Google make money by quickly directing users off their platforms\u2014through paid search ads for Google and completed transactions for Amazon\u2014while Meta earns by increasing user engagement, similar to traditional media models.\nScotiabank is also optimistic about the company\u2019s potential in artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon and Google are expected to capitalize the most on AI investments, with their cloud services playing a pivotal role in monetizing corporate AI applications.\nIn contrast, Scotiabank sees Meta\u2019s AI efforts as more focused on improving ad targeting and consumer engagement, which they describe as \"incremental rather than revolutionary.\"\nOverall, while Scotiabank sees strong potential for Amazon and Google in AI-driven growth, they are less certain about Meta\u2019s long-term competitive edge in the evolving tech landscape\nRelated Articles\nScotiabank Starts big tech coverage: Amazon and Google Outperform, Meta Neutral\nNippon Steel to sell Calvert JV to ArcelorMittal if U.S. Steel deal completed\nStrong bank earnings push S&P 500, Dow to record highs\n"

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nAs the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nHoward Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations. Solita Marcelli from UBS Global Wealth Management expressed optimism that upcoming third-quarter results could catalyze further gains, particularly as the semiconductor sector remains a focal point for AI investment.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Truist analyst Youssef Squali recently raised the price target on the stock to $265 from $230 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The advisory detailed that Amazon's North America revenue was tracking to consensus estimates, reflecting a resilient consumer, sustained growth in advertising revenue, faster growth at Web Services and higher operating margins year-over-year. This came even as the company invested aggressively in artificial intelligence, AWS, logistics and Project Kuiper, the advisory told investors in a research note. Truist said Amazon remained its favorite mega cap as the company continued to gain share of global e-commerce and improved its value proposition to both merchants and consumers. It was also one of the best ways to play cloud, AI, digital ads and global logistics, contended the advisory, which moved the price target to fiscal 2025 from 2024.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could potentially save more than $20 billion annually by deploying autonomous electric vehicles (EVs) for middle- and last-mile delivery, according to a recent note from JMP Securities.\nThe investment firm believes that Amazon's use of autonomous driving technology, coupled with electric vehicles such as Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) delivery vans, presents a significant opportunity to reduce costs across its global shipping operations.\nJMP says fuel expenses typically account for around 25-30% of per-mile costs in both middle- and last-mile deliveries. They believe switching to electric vehicles could cut per-mile energy costs by nearly 50%.\nAdditionally, they note that driver wages and benefits represent over 40% of the cost per mile in middle-mile transport.\nBy replacing internal combustion engine trucks with autonomous electric vehicles for middle-mile transport, JMP says Amazon could reduce shipping expenses by approximately 20% globally. This would translate to around $1.15 in savings per mile, contributing to the projected $20 billion annual savings.\nIn the near term, \"as AMZN converts its last-mile fleet to electric Rivian fans, we see the potential for up to $7B of annual savings, globally,\" writes JMP.\nWhile the larger savings from autonomous technology may take longer to materialize, the firm emphasizes that the potential for substantial cost reductions is significant over time.\n\"To be clear, we view this as a medium- to long-term opportunity,\" adds JMP, maintaining a Market Outperform rating and $265 per share price target on Amazon.\nRelated Articles\nCan Amazon save $20B per year by deploying autonomous EVs?\nExclusive-Thermo Fisher's plant making infant RSV drug breached FDA rules, documents show\nCVS Health upgraded at TD Cowen after insurer unveils 2025 Medicare Advantage plan\n"

What is still anchoring the market is big tech, even though their earnings themselves are kind of decelerating. Then seasonality comes into play. October is the weakest month, and you don\u2019t want to get ahead of that.\u201d\nAsked whether he does not believe the market really broadened out, Krishna said while there were some signs of market broadening, the \u201canchor\u201d of the rally remains big tech, which according to him, are just six stocks.\nMoving beyond the earnings and valuations debate, another factor still impacting investor sentiment is the Federal Reserve\u2019s next moves.\nTalking about the latest Fed minutes released October 9, \u00a0Wolfe Research\u2019s Stephanie Roth said on CNBC that a \u201csubstantial\u201d majority of Fed officials wanted a 50-basis-point rate cut.

Brad Gerstner said Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) \u201chas to invest\u201d in Anthropic because MSFT currently has an edge because of its OpenAI investments.\nAWS\u2019s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines.

This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon\u2019s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October.

        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Cathie Wood built a name for herself and her investment firm Ark Invest by racking up some huge gains between 2017 and 2020 in the exchange-traded fund Ark Innovation ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKK). However, since 2020 the ETF's performance has been much more volatile, including a 67% decline in 2022 followed by a nearly 68% gain in 2023. This year the fund is trading down more than 10% despite the strong performance by the broader market.\nLooking to help turn around her ETF's performance around this month, Wood has made some adjustments to her portfolio in recent months. One adjustment was to buy 76,505 shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), worth nearly $14 million, on Oct. 8.\nLet's take a closer look at Amazon and see if investors should follow Wood into the stock.\nMany of the Ark Innovation ETF's top positions have reputations for being divisive among investors. Holdings such as Tesla, Roblox, Palantir Technologies, Coinbase Global, and RobinHood Markets tend to draw some very strong bullish and bearish arguments among those who follow stocks. Amazon clearly does not fit into this category as a more established company that has become the leader in both e-commerce and cloud computing.\nAmazon is most associated with its e-commerce business, where it has captured a huge 38% market share in the United States, according to data analytics website Statista. That dwarfs its next largest competitor, Walmart, which has just over a 6% share.\nThe company sells its own goods on its platform as well as operating as a third-party marketplace. It also offers logistics and warehouse services to get customers their orders as quickly as possible. The e-commerce segment remains a solid grower for Amazon, with online store revenue up 6% year over year last quarter to $55.4 billion and third-party seller services revenue climbing 13% to $36.2 billion.\nThe company is looking to push growth and reduce costs in this business segment through the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Its efforts include using AI to optimize driver delivery routes and to better forecast demand, using AI-trained robots to more quickly find items in warehouses, and using AI to help improve listings and make it easier for third-party sellers to list items.\nAmazon is also pushing into the pharmacy business and is looking to bring same-day prescription delivery across nearly half the country next year. With traditional pharmacies closing stores, this is a nice opportunity.\nOn the cloud computing front, Amazon is also the top player, with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform having about a 32% market share. This is also the larger of Amazon's two main businesses based on operating income, with AWS having Q2 operating income of $9.3 billion versus $5.3 billion for its e-commerce business.\nAWS benefits from customers looking to build out AI applications through its platform. Customers can use its SageMaker platform, which helps them develop their own AI models, and its Bedrock platform, which offers foundational large language models (LLMs) from both itself and AI start-ups to use as starting points.\nAI, along with the continued migration of data to the cloud, helped drive 19% revenue growth at AWS to $26.3 billion in Q2. Cloud computing is a high-fixed-cost business, so this improvement led to a whopping 72% in segment operating income to $9.3 billion.\nAmazon is spending heavily on AI infrastructure to help keep up with demand, but the company is generating prolific operating cash flow and has a boatload of cash on its balance sheet. The company also has a very strong track record of investing in its business for the long-term benefit of its shareholders. It did this to build out its warehouse and logistics network as well as when it built out AWS.\nAs such, investors should not fret over the company's increasing capital expenditures (capex), as Amazon has always come out the other side of these heavy investment periods as a better company. AWS, meanwhile, is now the company's largest and it's growing faster. Given the operating leverage in this business, this is a good thing for investors.\nTrading at a forward P/E of just over 32 times earnings based on next year's analyst estimates and with its enterprise value (EV) trading at 14 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), I think Amazon's stock is pretty attractively priced. It has traded at much higher multiples in the past, and it still has solid growth in front of it.\nI prefer looking at Amazon stock on an EV-to-EBITDA basis, as it takes into consideration its net cash and removes its noncash depreciation costs associated with the past buildouts of its warehouses and data centers.\nAs such, I think investors can follow Ark Invest with this particular investment and buy Amazon stock for the long haul.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Maleha Afzal ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising AI Stocks According to Analysts.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other promising AI stocks.\nWhile 2024 has been a solid year for defensive stocks and utilities, the technology sector, on the other hand, experienced significant headwinds. However, the general outlook for technology and AI is starting to improve as we near the end of 2024. On October 9, Dominic Rizzo, T. Rowe Price portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his thesis for the AI industry.\nMost investors were disappointed after they failed to generate higher returns for their investments in AI during the second quarter of 2024. While Rizzo expects the theme to prevail for the next few quarters, he suggests that the technology and AI sector is on track to earn better returns, especially companies using artificial intelligence to improve their businesses.\nAs for the Magnificent Seven, while all companies have distinct business models and offerings, these companies have grown at a 50% to 100% faster rate than the rest of the market, making it reasonable to group them. Overall, Rizzo reiterates that while the group has been under immense pressure, it is well-positioned to leverage AI to its benefit.\nRizzo believes that AI is an innovation that is here to stay rather than a mere disruptive technology, meaning that companies using it to their benefit will most likely perform better than the ones that are not. Therefore, most if not companies have no other option but to direct investments in AI chips and GPUs. He expects the AI chip market to reach $400 billion by 2027.\nTechnology has been altering the world since humans came into being. On October 8, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan CEO appeared in an interview on Bloomberg Television where he discussed the role of artificial intelligence, initial public offerings, and the easing cycle by the Fed.\nAccording to Dimon, technology was previously limited to certain regions and countries, but now we have tech centers in almost every part of the world including Berlin, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. According to Dimon, the acceleration in technology is great and he is glad that innovation is taking precedence, especially in Europe.\nSpeaking of AI, Dimon suggests that artificial intelligence is going to change a lot of things that are common elements of our world. As far as job losses go, technology has always been changing the job market and is mostly responsible for taking away jobs. However, he emphasizes the need to look at the bigger picture.\nOverall, Dimon suggests that jobs will likely be more enhanced and researched-oriented. As for sectors like finance, people have been using it to detect fraud and minimize risk already. Similarly, AI has limited a lot of marketing jobs but at the same time, it has left a positive impact on productivity. Dimon shares he is not worried about AI changing the job landscape and that we should focus on re-training and re-educating workers losing their jobs as new technologies keep springing.\nNow that we have studied the outlook of the AI industry, let's take a look at the most promising AI stocks to buy according to analysts.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the most promising AI stocks according to analysts, we sifted through multiple ETFs, our own rankings, and similar rankings on the internet. We then ranked the most promising AI stocks based on the Analyst upside as of October 9, 2024. We also included the hedge fund sentiment for each stock. It is to be noted, that we only considered stocks with a market capitalization of over $1 billion, as of October 9, 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nAnalyst Upside as of October 9, 2024: 22%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks ninth on our list of the most promising AI stocks according to analysts. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a technology company that specializes in e-commerce, online retail, streaming, and data cloud services.\nIts proprietary cloud service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), increased its revenue by 18.8% in Q2 and has reported 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters. Coming to its dominance in AI, Over the past few months, the company has not only forged partnerships with AI startups and the government but it has also been actively involved in the development of AI hardware. Recent chips produced by the company include Trainium and Inferentia.\nIn addition to that, AWS is now housing the next generation of Llama models from Meta, giving customers more choices to build, deploy, and scale generative AI applications. On September 19, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched Project Amelia, a selling assistant backed by generative AI, allowing sellers to offer better customer assistance and reach.\nOverall, AWS has close to 31% market share in cloud computing, indicative of its dominance in the market. Now that AWS is increasingly adopting AI-backed systems, the company is poised to become a fully AI-run company in the next few years.\nAnalysts are bullish on AMZN and their 12-month median price target of $220 points to a 22% upside from current levels. According to our Insider Monkey database, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion.\nDiamond Hill SelectStrategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"Among our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\"\nOverall AMZN ranks 9th on our list of the most promising AI stocks according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Investing.com -- Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note Thursday that Wall Street's profit expectations for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), particularly for the fourth quarter of 2024, may be overly optimistic.\nThe bank highlighted that despite long-term bullish prospects, near-term headwinds could impact Amazon's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) guidance.\nThe analysts see \"tactical risk to 4Q EBIT\" as the company continues to invest heavily in its lower-margin essentials business.\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, Amazon's push to expand its essential goods offering, a key growth area, could hurt short-term profits.\n\"We see AMZN's high and growing focus on lower-priced, lower-margin essentials driving merchandise margin pressure,\" the bank states.\nThe pressure, combined with a competitive holiday season and cautious consumer spending, is seen as potentially weighing on Amazon's North America retail profit growth.\nThe bank expects fourth-quarter EBIT to come in around $1 billion to $1.5 billion below current Wall Street estimates of $17.5 billion.\nWhile this outlook may suggest a near-term pullback, Morgan Stanley remains optimistic about Amazon's long-term growth, particularly as the company looks ahead to 2025.\nThe analysts point to several profit drivers, including improved cost efficiencies and a potential $2 to $4 billion in corporate savings. They also note that Amazon's Kuiper satellite project, which some fear could be a financial drain, is \"likely manageable\" with an annual cost of $600-$700 million.\nMorgan Stanley maintained its $210 price target for Amazon, expecting a rebound in profitability beyond 2024. \"We view these profit challenges as temporary and not structural,\" the bank says, adding that it remains \"buyers on weakness\" as they look toward multiple profit drivers into 2025.\nRelated Articles\nWall Street profit expectations for Amazon 'still seem high' warns Morgan Stanley\nUber, Lyft drivers use Teslas as makeshift robotaxis, raising safety concerns\nTesla to recall over 27,000 Cybertruck vehicles over rear-view image delay\n"

        "Title": "Prediction: Amazon.com Will Lose Money on Project Kuiper",
        "Author": "  Rich Smith, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In 2019, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) announced its next big business idea. Following in the footsteps of SpaceX founder Elon Musk and his Starlink satellite internet system, Amazon would build a competing satellite internet business: Project Kuiper.\nThe plan calls for the deployment of 3,236 satellites, which will require 92 separate rocket launches to put them in orbit. Yet this massive undertaking will actually be smaller in scope than Starlink, which will eventually boast 12,000 satellites, and will need to launch more than 100 times a year just to refresh its constellation as old satellites fall out of orbit. Even so, Amazon initially estimated the cost of Project Kuiper would be roughly similar to the $10 billion that Musk said it would cost SpaceX to create Starlink.\nThere's just one problem with that: It turns out Amazon may have been wrong. Deploying the Kuiper constellation might cost it as much as twice that amount.\nIn a report titled \"Amazon Project Kuiper ... A Quilty Space Deep Dive\" last month, space sector business intelligence company Quilty Space warned that \"costs are ballooning\" on Project Kuiper, and forecast that it would take between $16.5 billion and $20 billion to deploy the first generation of the constellation.\nGranted, with $89 billion in cash and equivalents on its books and more than $48 billion in annual free cash flow (according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence), Amazon can easily manage those greater expenses if it needs to. But the higher the initial costs run, the harder it's going to be for Amazon to turn a profit on Project Kuiper. And the more money Amazon ends up losing on it, the more this venture will be a drag on company profits -- and the more investors may regret it.\nWhy is Project Kuiper looking likely to cost so much more than Amazon initially expected? It's hard to be certain, as the company is keeping mum. But a couple of possibilities suggest themselves.\nFirst and most obviously, there's the fact that Amazon is an e-commerce company -- not a rocket company. Unlike SpaceX, which builds its own satellites and builds its own rockets to launch them (for a price that rounds down to free), Amazon must buy its rocket rides on the open market. To date, it has contracted with everyone from Boeing to Lockheed Martin to Airbus to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's own pet rocket company, Blue Origin. Operating under a time crunch to get its satellites in orbit by a regulator-imposed deadline, Amazon even bought a few launches on SpaceX's Falcon 9.\nA second factor, perhaps less well-known to the public, may be internal to Project Kuiper itself.\nAs space journalist Eric Berger notes in his recent book, Reentry: SpaceX, Elon Musk, and the Reusable Rockets that Launched a Second Space Age, Amazon has hired former SpaceX Starlink head Rajeev Badyal to run Project Kuiper.\nBut as Berger also reports, back when Badyal worked for SpaceX, he \"clashed\" with Musk. Badyal moved \"too cautiously,\" wrote Berger, and \"wanted to continue tinkering with the Starlink satellite design,\" while Musk is infamous for wanting everything done yesterday. Eventually, in June 2018, Musk fired Badyal.\nIf Amazon has SpaceX's second-string Starlink team running Project Kuiper, it makes sense that it might take longer to deploy and wind up costing more than Starlink. Furthermore, as Quilty points out in its recent report, it doesn't bode well that \"Amazon placed Kuiper within its troubled Devices & Services division instead of its rockstar Web Services unit.\"\nGiven Amazon's \"shaky\" record scoring hits in consumer devices, and its demonstrated willingness to shut down money-losing projects, that almost seems like intentional foreshadowing.\nCould Project Kuiper end up costing twice as much as it was originally supposed to?\nI wouldn't be surprised if it does. Most of the companies Amazon has contracted with to launch its satellites charge far more than SpaceX does for rocket launches -- $100 million and up. At those prices, just the cost of launching 92 times could easily burn through Amazon's $10 billion budget. And that's before accounting for the cost of building the 3,236 satellites.\nAt Quilty's estimated cost of $1.5 million to $2 million apiece, the satellites alone could cost Amazon $6.5 billion.\nThat's a heck of a big start-up cost Amazon will need to earn back as it begins launching its satellites to orbit and signing up customers. Yes, begins. So far, Amazon has only launched a pair of test satellites. Operational satellite launches aren't expected to start until later this year -- and the constellation must be completed by July 2026 or Amazon will violate the terms of its Federal Communications Commission license.\nIn a best-case scenario, Quilty's report posits that if Amazon can eventually sign up 100 million paying customers for, say, $30 a month, that would give Project Kuiper annual revenues of $36 billion -- about as much as Amazon reaps in annual subscription revenues today. But it's a long road from zero subscribers and two satellites to 100 million subscribers and 3,236 satellites.\nAmazon is going to be losing money on this project for a long time.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

Amazon also held a beauty event in the spring, Prime Day in the summer and an autumn Prime sale earlier this month, with many rivals falling in line to compete.\nEven as consumers remain careful about the money they spend on discretionary items, the beauty category has been resilient, with many splurging on premium labels and products.\nCircana found that, in the first half of the year, U.S. prestige beauty sales rose 8% year over year to $15.3 billion, with the strongest growth in fragrance. Sales of mass market products fared worse, with fragrance down 1%, makeup down 4%, hair care up 2% and skin care up just 1%.\nSeveral retailers offering the same brands featured in Amazon\u2019s sale will be jostling for beauty consumers\u2019 attention as the season takes off. Along with players like department stores and specialty retailers like Sephora and Ulta, which have traditionally offered beauty products and services, mass merchants like Target and Walmart have expanded their beauty shelf space. Target continues to add Ulta spaces to its stores, and Walmart\u2019s marketplace recently added premium beauty.\nThis year, the presidential election will also take up some oxygen as Amazon\u2019s beauty event unfolds. According to PwC, political advertising is expected to dominate various channels in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election, and some marketing may quiet down somewhat until voting is over.\nStill, there\u2019s pressure to ramp up seasonal marketing early, given the condensed shopping period due to a late Thanksgiving this year. About a third of shoppers say they\u2019ll start working on their holiday lists before November, according to Gartner.\n"

The report highlighted positive Azure checks with partners finishing above plan for Azure in the recent quarter, driven by strong demand in cloud migration, modernization projects, and AI workloads.\n\"Stronger-than-usual checks suggest underlying Azure momentum continuing; expect shares benefit as more model clarity surfaces through FY25,\" said the bank.\nAzure growth is expected to accelerate with 33% year-over-year growth in Q1, including 12 points from AI, Wells Fargo stated.\nAdditionally, Microsoft's rollout of Copilot, its AI-powered productivity tool, is expected to gradually drive adoption and long-term revenue, even though it's still in the early stages.\nWells Fargo has a price target of $515 for Microsoft, reflecting a premium based on its significant scale and favorable long-term growth prospects.\nThe report pointed out that the current capex investments in AI would continue to impact free cash flow multiples, but long-term earnings growth remains robust.\nRelated Articles\nAfter downgrading Amazon, Wells Fargo says buy Microsoft stock\nGreencore stock rallies 10% as analysts say 'upgrade momentum continues'\nChina's stocks rally fizzles as stimulus offer disappoints\n"

These companies are scrambling to secure reliable, round-the-clock energy sources, and SMRs are quickly becoming the go-to solution. As demand for AI infrastructure continues to soar, both NuScale and Oklo are emerging as key players in this high-stakes race for clean power.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SMR.\nAmazon isn't wasting any time. The company just dropped $500 million into X-energy and teamed up with Dominion Energy to explore SMR projects aimed at powering its expanding data centers. Meanwhile, Google has signed a deal with Kairos Power to bring SMRs online by the end of the decade. Both Amazon and Google are grappling with the massive energy demands needed to keep their AI systems running smoothly, and SMRs offer the perfect answerscalable, clean, and reliable energy.\nWith AI applications requiring far more power than traditional data centers, SMRs give these tech behemoths a way to keep pace with growth while sticking to their carbon-free commitments. SMRs not only provide 24/7 energy but can be built faster and more cost-effectively than conventional nuclear plants.

Full-time employees are also eligible for first day benefits that include health care coverage and education tuition assistance. With benefits, the company said its average total compensation for fulfillment and transportation employees is over $29 per hour.\nAmazon said nearly one-third of people who come to work at the company as a holiday hire return. The company also said applicants can receive a contingent job offer immediately after applying for an open position.\u00a0\nAmazon\u2019s latest hiring announcement mirrors the company\u2019s position from last year, when it sought to hire a similar number of people ahead of the holidays.\u00a0As of June 30, Amazon said it employed over 1.53 million people, excluding temporary workers and contractors. That\u2019s up 5% from Q2 of last year.\nThe company joins many other retailers that have recently made noteworthy holiday hiring announcements. They include Target, which wants to bring on 100,000 seasonal workers; Macy\u2019s, which said it has jobs for 31,500 people across its three banners; Burlington, which is seeking 24,000 people; and J.C. Penney, which is seeking 10,000 seasonal staff. Walmart said it\u2019s been hiring throughout the year but hasn\u2019t announced a specific number.\nAmazon said last month it would invest $2.2 billion into additional pay for about 800,000 fulfillment and transportation workers. The move equates to a $1.50 per hour pay increase for anyone who works a 40-hour week. Hourly workers also receive a free Prime membership as long as they work for the company.\nAdditional benefits for Amazon employees include access to earned pay at any time; a 401(k) with company match; up to 20 weeks of paid pregnancy or parental leave for birth parents and six weeks leave for eligible supporting parents; and Amazon\u2019s Resources for Living program, a free benefit that offers mental health and financial services and support.\nAmazon also touted seasonal jobs as an opportunity to start a long-term career. In a blog post, Sandy Gordon, vice president of global operations employee experience, said seasonal employees who stay with the company can see an average pay bump of 15% during their first three years of employment.\nRetail holiday hiring and layoff trends shifted after the onset of the pandemic, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. During the 2022 to 2023 and 2023 to 2024 holiday seasons, the BLS said the holiday hiring buildup shifted from being stronger than pre-pandemic trends to weaker. In 2022 to 2023, retailers added 454,000 holiday jobs.\u00a0\n"

        "Text": "Amazon\u00a0(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock slipped 2.7% through 10:20 a.m. ET Monday morning after Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski downgraded the stock from overweight to equal weight (i.e., from buy to hold).\nGawrelski also cut his price target on the e-commerce giant to $183 -- just a couple of dollars above where it trades this morning.\nWhat's worrying Gawrelski about Amazon stock, which has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 13 points over the past 52 weeks?\nAmazon has outperformed analyst estimates in each of the past four reported quarters, and as Gawrelski explains in a note on StreetInsider.com today, this has encouraged analysts to go farther out on a limb predicting stronger and stronger earnings. Gawrelski, however, worries that these forecasts are going to start weakening \"in the near term\" as operating profit margin starts to flatten.\nGawrelski sees three particular areas of weakness threatening Amazon.\nFirst, the company's high-margin advertising business, where third-party merchants are under pressure and may be spending less. Second, the company's Fulfillment by Amazon (or FBA) logistics business, where Amazon assists third-party merchants in selling and shipping their wares. Here, the worry is that competition from Walmart\u00a0may hurt Amazon's ability to hike FBA fees. Third and finally, Gawrelski sees risk in and Amazon's Project Kuiper, the company's multibillion-dollar effort to build a satellite internet system to rival SpaceX's Starlink.\nNot all the news is bad. Gawrelski still argues that \"Amazon remains a margin expansion story, just likely a more moderate margin expansion pace than the market expects.\" Still, that poses a risk for investors in Amazon stock.\nConsider: Valued at more than 40 times trailing free cash flow currently, and 44 times trailing earnings, Amazon needs to show strong double-digit growth to justify its relatively rich valuation. Just growing isn't enough. Amazon needs to show incredibly strong and sustainable growth to make its share price make sense.\nGawrelski's warning of weakening profit margins calls that growth rate into question.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Amazon has announced a series of partnerships for the development of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), aiming to power its data centres with new nuclear technologies.\nThe technology giant is leading the $500m funding round for X-Energy Reactor, a company specialising in SMRs.\nSMRs offer a smaller footprint and quicker build times, potentially accelerating the deployment of nuclear energy.\nAmazon is also collaborating with utility companies in the Washington state and Virginia on potential nuclear energy projects.\nWith X-Energy, Amazon aims to bring more than 5GW of new power projects online in the US by 2039.\nIn Washington state, Amazon has partnered with Energy Northwest to develop four advanced SMRs, with an initial capacity of 320MW, expandable to 960MW.\nThis phase could power over 770,000 US homes, addressing the Pacific Northwest's energy needs from the early 2030s.\nIn Virginia, Amazon is exploring an SMR project with Dominion Energy near the existing North Anna nuclear power station.\nThis project is expected to contribute at least 300MW to the region, aligning with Dominion's forecast of an 85% increase in power demand over the next 15 years.\nAmazon's shift to nuclear energy also includes an agreement to position a data centre adjacent to Talen Energy's nuclear facility in Pennsylvania, directly sourcing carbon-free energy and supporting the existing reactor.\nAmazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman said: \u201cNuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040.\n\u201cOne of the fastest ways to address climate change is by transitioning our society to carbon-free energy sources, and nuclear energy is both carbon-free and able to scale\u2014which is why it is an important area of investment for Amazon. Our agreements will encourage the construction of new nuclear technologies that will generate energy for decades to come.\u201d\nThis move by Amazon comes shortly after Google announced a partnership with Kairos Power to develop advanced reactor plants under Power Purchase Agreements, aiming to supply clean electricity to Google data centres by 2030.\nThese initiatives by leading tech companies reflect a growing trend to meet the surging energy demands of artificial intelligence and data centres.\n\"Amazon signs agreements to develop small modular nuclear reactors \" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Title": "Amazon\u2019s recyclable packaging push",
        "Author": "  Oumar Fofana ",
        "Text": "The e-commerce industry has seen rapid growth in recent years, bringing to light concerns about the environmental impact of packaging waste. As one of the largest e-commerce companies globally, Amazon's approach to packaging has significant implications for sustainability.\nIn response to increasing pressure from consumers, environmental groups, and regulatory bodies, Amazon has taken steps to introduce more recyclable packaging options.\nThis article examines Amazon\u2019s recyclable packaging initiatives, their impact on packaging waste, and what these efforts mean for the broader industry.\nAmazon\u2019s \u201cFrustration-Free Packaging\u201d programme, launched in response to concerns over excessive packaging, is an attempt to minimise waste. The programme aims to ship products in easy-to-open, recyclable packaging, often eliminating the need for an additional Amazon-branded box.\nThis initiative, according to Amazon, has led to the removal of significant amounts of packaging material, with reported reductions of over 1.5 million tonnes since 2015.\nThe reduction in packaging waste aligns with a growing trend in the e-commerce sector, where companies face increasing scrutiny over their environmental practices.\nHowever, while Amazon's figures suggest a positive trend, it's essential to consider the broader context. Many environmental experts argue that more systemic changes across the entire e-commerce sector are necessary to address packaging waste issues comprehensively.\nAmazon's shift towards recyclable materials is another aspect of its packaging strategy. The company has introduced paper-based mailers that are curbside recyclable, reducing reliance on plastic packaging.\nThis transition forms part of Amazon\u2019s pledge to reduce its environmental impact and work towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.\nThe adoption of recyclable packaging materials is a step in line with industry-wide efforts to tackle plastic waste, yet challenges remain. Critics point out that while recyclable packaging is an improvement, it is not a complete solution to the packaging waste problem.\nIssues such as recycling infrastructure, consumer habits, and the carbon footprint associated with producing these materials must also be considered to gain a holistic view of the situation.\nAmazon\u2019s \"Less Packaging, More Smiles\" initiative has urged suppliers to adopt more sustainable packaging designs, which may contribute to broader shifts in the supply chain.\nHowever, the long-term effectiveness of this strategy will depend on consistent industry-wide adoption and the development of recycling systems that can manage increased volumes of recyclable waste.\nIn an effort to optimise packaging and reduce waste, Amazon has introduced technology-driven solutions, including machine learning algorithms that select appropriately sized boxes for each order.\nThis approach reduces the use of excess packaging materials and filler, contributing to improved recyclability.\nThe use of technology in packaging is not unique to Amazon, but the scale at which it operates makes this application particularly noteworthy. By reducing the number of delivery trips through optimised packaging, Amazon also addresses concerns related to carbon emissions.\nHowever, whether these technological solutions can be fully integrated into the wider e-commerce industry remains to be seen, as smaller companies may lack the resources to implement similar systems.\nAmazon has also experimented with alternative packaging materials, such as water-activated tape, which is more recyclable than traditional plastic tape.\nSuch initiatives reflect an ongoing exploration of more sustainable packaging options, but questions remain about their scalability and the impact on recycling systems that may not be equipped to handle new types of materials.\nAmazon\u2019s efforts to introduce recyclable packaging have contributed to a wider discussion about sustainability in packaging. As one of the major players in e-commerce, the company's actions have prompted other businesses to evaluate their own packaging practices.\nHowever, the question of whether these changes are enough to create meaningful industry-wide impact is still under debate.\nThe packaging industry, influenced by shifts in consumer expectations and regulatory pressures, is increasingly moving towards sustainable practices. Amazon\u2019s initiatives, while significant, represent just one part of a larger effort to address packaging waste.\nOther e-commerce companies, suppliers, and manufacturers are adopting similar approaches, using recyclable and biodegradable materials and redesigning packaging to reduce waste.\nRegulatory developments, especially in regions like the European Union, where single-use plastics face stricter regulations, have also played a role in driving the push towards recyclable packaging.\nAmazon\u2019s efforts reflect a response to such trends, yet the broader industry still faces challenges in adapting to evolving regulatory requirements and consumer expectations.\n\"Amazon\u2019s recyclable packaging push\" was originally created and published by Packaging Gateway, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "Author": "  Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Up 125% since the start of 2023, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been one of the hottest stocks around over the last two years. Yet, the question many investors want to know is whether Amazon is still a smart buy today. \nI think it is. Here are three reasons why.\nMany investors may not appreciate that Amazon's signature business, its e-commerce segment, is no longer its chief growth engine. That segment is only growing at around 5% year over year.\nIn contrast, Amazon's cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), grew 19% to $26.3 billion in the second quarter. Similarly, the company's underappreciated advertising unit grew 20% to $12.8 billion.\nCombined, those two units now drive around $150 billion in annual sales for Amazon. Granted, that's only about a quarter of the nearly $600 billion that Amazon generates every year, but $150 billion in sales is surely nothing to sneeze at.\nMoreover, given how fast those units are growing, Amazon's overall revenue growth should remain high well into the future even if its signature e-commerce unit fails to produce double-digit growth.\nCompanies are nothing without the people. They are the dynamic ingredient that drive an organization forward. And no person is more important to a company than its chief manager -- its CEO. In the case of Amazon, the company is still only a few years away from a monumental shift. Gone is founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos. In his place, Andy Jassy has taken over. \nJassy, 56, has now been at the helm for more than three years, and I judge his tenure to be off to a great start. Granted, Amazon's stock sank during his first 18 months in charge, but much of that had to do with the pandemic slump that gripped the stock market during 2022. \nSince the start of 2023, Amazon's shares have gained 125% thanks, in part, to cost-cutting measures put in place by Jassy. In summary, Amazon's current CEO is demonstrating the sound leadership that investors should look for in their stock holdings.\nFinally, let's talk fundamentals. On this front, Amazon's strength should be easy to see. Amazon's net income and free cash flow -- two of the most important financial metrics for any company -- are nearing record levels.\nAMZN Net Income (TTM) data by YCharts.\nBoth figures have bounced back for a few reasons. First, Amazon has scaled back some large-scale infrastructure investments, like its massive HQ2 center in Virginia. Moreover, many logistical investments made during the pandemic have now been fully implemented, including the company's shift to regional distribution hubs, which help the company deliver packages faster and with lower costs.\nIn sum, Amazon is more than just a stock that has soared in value. Its combination of high-growth businesses, sound management, and rock-solid fundamentals make it a stock worth owning now and well into the future.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

It\u2019s been going on for decades.\u201d\nTo ensure you\u2019re getting an accurate discount, consider tracking prices.\n\u201cI constantly look on Amazon so I kind of keep track and see the numbers,\u201d said shopper Alvilynn Kumagai.\nThere are tools available to help.\nCamel Camel Camel tracks Amazon prices for you and can show you how far they\u2019ve dropped.\nYou might also want to be mindful of \u201cdoom scrolling\u201d on Amazon during major sale events to avoid impulse buys.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost the same as when you\u2019re in the grocery store and you see an item that\u2019s at the checkout line,\u201d Chase said.\nCompare prices with other retailers too, as several other retailers have started offering flash sales to coincide with Prime Day.\n\n"

This pilot location \u2014 located in the same One Chicago building as a Whole Foods store \u2014 aims to minimize the need for Whole Foods customers to shop elsewhere.\u00a0\nTony Hoggett, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide grocery stores, posted on LinkedIn about the new concept\u2019s debut on Thursday: \u201cCustomers can now shop their favorite natural and organic brands while also quickly topping up their groceries with a larger assortment of favorite national brands, grab-and-go meals, and household essentials\u2014all in one trip.\u201d\nThe store houses 3,500 products and spans 3,800 square feet, making it almost a third the size of Whole Foods\u2019 Daily Shop on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The location does not feature Just Walk Out frictionless checkout technology.\u00a0\nCurrently, Amazon said it does not have any expansion plans to share for the concept.\u00a0\nThroughout 2024, Amazon has built its grocery operations by expanding its Amazon Fresh footprint, launching new private label lines, debuting two new subscription plans and streamlining shopping across its channels.\u00a0\nEarlier this month, Amazon announced it had revamped 26 Amazon Fresh fulfillment centers to include a wider array of products, including Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods goods. In the same press release, the company noted it\u2019s building its first-ever automated micro-fulfillment center in a Pennsylvania Whole Foods store to bolster the location\u2019s product assortment.\u00a0\nThese growth initiatives emphasize Amazon\u2019s mission over the past year to get the \u201cfundamentals\u201d of grocery right, but also show the company can do this while utilizing its massive online retail market.\u00a0\nLast week, Hoggett shared on LinkedIn that Whole Foods has seen over 40% sales growth since Amazon bought the grocery chain in 2017.\n"

        "Author": "  Lucas Manfredi ",
        "Text": "Amazon is seeking to dismiss a class action lawsuit alleging it misled Prime Video subscribers about charging them an extra fee in order to avoid watching ads on the service, arguing that plaintiffs \u201cgot exactly what they bargained for.\u201d\nIn January, the platform introduced an ad-supported tier with limited advertisements and switched all of its users to the plan by default, with the option to avoid ads by paying a $2.99 per month fee. Shortly after, a lawsuit was filed in California that accused the company of committing breach of contract and violating consumer protection laws in the state for consumers who saw their subscription terms change due to the pivot.\nBut the tech giant argues that the service has long included limited ads during live sporting events and other content and that it \u201cnever promised \u2014 to Prime members or anyone else \u2014 that Prime Video would be always, or entirely, ad-free.\u201d It added that the class-action suit falsely and fundamentally mischaracterizes the $2.99 fee as a price increase for Prime memberships.\n\u201cEven though Amazon has the right to increase the Prime membership fee, Plaintiffs and other Prime members paid exactly the same fee for Prime before and after the change to Prime Video. Access to Prime Video is just one of the many Prime benefits that Amazon may change in its discretion,\u201d the company wrote in its motion to dismiss filed on Friday. \u201cBut Plaintiffs still have complete access to Prime Video, and all of its content, and pay nothing extra for it. In other words, even though Amazon could permissibly change, or remove entirely, any Prime benefit, it did not do so with Prime Video.\u201d\nAmazon said that the plaintiffs\u2019 relationship is governed by the Prime membership\u2019s terms and conditions, which they agreed to, rather than Prime Video, and that under those terms, it\u2019s \u201cfree to change or eliminate that feature, at its discretion, at any time.\u201d\n\u201cTo hold otherwise would deprive Amazon of the benefit of its bargain,\u201d the company added.\nAmazon also noted that, despite being given a month\u2019s notice, five of the plaintiffs never chose to cancel and two voluntarily chose to pay the $2.99 per month fee to avoid the \u201c\u2019annoy[ance]\u2019 of ads.\u201d\n\u201cIf Plaintiffs truly believed that the separate, optional payment of $2.99 per month undercuts all of the substantial value of a Prime membership, they were free to cancel Prime. None of the Plaintiffs allege that they even tried to cancel, let alone that they sought a refund and were denied one,\u201d Amazon continued. \u201cThe CCAC should be dismissed with prejudice.\u201d\nCurrently, Amazon Prime \u2014 which includes Prime Video \u2014 costs $14.99 per month or $139 a year. A membership that only includes Prime Video and none of the company\u2019s shipping benefits costs $8.99 per month.\nThe class action suit is seeking at least $5 million, as well as a court order barring Amazon from engaging in further deceptive conduct on behalf of users who subscribed to Prime prior to Dec. 28, 2023. Representatives for the plaintiffs did not immediately return TheWrap\u2019s request for comment.\nThe legal action follows a separate suit from the Federal Trade Commission last year, which accused Amazon of making it difficult for consumers to unsubscribe to their Prime subscriptions by using a \u201cmanipulative\u201d and \u201ccoercive\u201d interface. Bloomberg reported last week that Amazon has received a partial dismissal of the FTC suit, with a bench trial slated for October 2026.\nThe post Amazon Seeks to Dismiss Ad Tier Lawsuit, Says Prime Viewers \u2018Got Exactly What They Bargained For\u2019 appeared first on TheWrap.\n"

We go into Amazon Prime Day, you get all excited, you wander around the website and you buy stuff that you probably shouldn\u2019t buy.\nBuy now, pay later programs have become increasingly popular in recent years, especially as inflation soared in 2021 and 2022. A Bankrate survey last April found more than 1 in 3 Americans have used a buy now, pay later service.\nThe survey also found 56% of users encountered issues, like overspending and missing payments.\n\u201cWe have to be really careful about this debt situation,\u201d Murset said. \u201cYou can get on that treadmill [of making payments] and never really get off, especially with interest rates at 25%, on average. That\u2019s a big problem.\u201d\nWhile buy now, pay later services can be helpful, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says they should only be used with a full understanding of the services requirements.\nMiss a payment, and the CFPB says you could face late fees, the lender could freeze your account to stop other purchases, and you could be turned over to a debt collector.\n\u201cConsumer debt is at an all time high, like $1.4 trillion on credit cards,\u201d Murset said. \u201cThis is a big problem.\u201d\nThe upcoming holidays may offer better deals, he adds, which is one more reason to shop wisely.\nMurset encourages shoppers to pay with a debit card instead of a credit card. Tying purchases to cash in a bank account can help shoppers stay on budget and avoid taking on additional debt to cover expenses.\nFor those who use a credit card, Murset says it\u2019s important to pay off the balance in full and on time each month to avoid late fees and accruing interest on any remaining balance.\nDownload the FREE Boston 25 News app for breaking news alerts.\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW\n"

        "Title": "Amazon airline sells excess cargo capacity to third-party shippers",
        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "(Updated 12:50 p.m. )\nAmazon has officially entered the for-hire air cargo market, making capacity on its large fleet of cargo jets broadly available for the first time to freight forwarders and other businesses after previously providing airlift to a limited set of companies. The creation of a direct sales channel for heavy shipments beyond Amazon\u2019s parcel ecosystem puts the e-commerce platform in position to challenge FedEx and UPS for a greater share of domestic airfreight.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) established its air logistics arm in 2016 to meet delivery commitments of one to two days for Prime members and drive customer satisfaction. Amazon Air, which relies on contract airlines to fly its leased parcel freighters, now has more than 100 aircraft in its fleet, several air sortation hubs, more than 250 daily flights and a route network that connects 54 U.S. airports.\nThe mega-retailer three weeks ago unveiled the Amazon Air Cargo website as a vehicle for advertising the airfreight product and booking shipments online. Shippers can tender freight as needed, reserve regular blocks of space or charter entire aircraft. Amazon is also offering air cargo service in Europe and India, where it operates more limited networks.\n\u201cReady for takeoff! Amazon Air Cargo is now open for business serving domestic networks across North America, EMEA, and Asia. Built on the backbone of Amazon\u2019s world-class logistics network, we\u2019re ready to handle, transport, and deliver your goods safely, securely, and efficiently \u2014 on time, every day,\u201d Amazon\u2019s logistics unit announced on LinkedIn.\nAmazon for years quietly sold space on its cargo jets to a handful of clients. Now it is fully externalizing the service to capitalize on excess capacity after working out the kinks for moving high volumes of third-party freight.\nHandling containers with products of varying types and sizes alongside express small parcels that are routed to destinations through a highly automated conveyor sortation system increases operational complexity. There is no publicly available information about whether Amazon freighter aircraft fly full, but logistics practitioners familiar with the company said the air network has imbalances where select lanes have weak load factors. Revenue gained from wholesale air cargo can help offset overhead costs, they said.\nAmazon\u2019s 3-year-old superhub at Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport is a key part of the company\u2019s ability to provide air shipping for customers outside the Amazon supply chain.\nThe new website allows Amazon Air to attract customers besides those using Amazon Prime, the electronic retailer\u2019s paid subscription service, as it opens the door to full-scale airfreight service. The target audience includes logistics companies, online retailers and postal services.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always working to develop new, innovative logistics solutions that support Amazon customers. Amazon Air Cargo has been offering third-party shippers access to Amazon\u2019s logistics network to deliver air shipments with speed and reliability since 2019, and we are excited to now expand the service to more cargo customers,\u201d spokesperson Alexa Clark said in a statement to FreightWaves.\nAmazon marketing states the carrier will haul all types of products, ranging from perishables, pharmaceuticals and oversized, to parcels and dangerous goods. Customers can access real-time supply and make cargo bookings by integrating their transportation management systems with Amazon\u2019s reservation system.\nThe Loadstar was first to notice Amazon\u2019s new effort to market air cargo shipping.\nAmazon mostly operates Boeing 737-800 narrowbody and Boeing 767 medium widebody freighters but has added six Airbus A330-300 large cargo jets to the fleet in the past year. Small fleets in Europe and India are entirely Boeing 737-800s.\nDuring the past two years, the retail giant has been more cautious about growing the air network as e-commerce sales normalized and it shifted to a regional fulfillment model that decreases reliance on air transport. Amazon Air has also mostly transitioned to a hub-and-spoke model that mirrors FedEx and UPS, with less point-to-point flying, according to researchers at DePaul University who monitor Amazon Air\u2019s progress. The European network serves about 10 airports, down from a high of 13 three years ago.\nThe regional fulfillment strategy \u201chas likely opened up spare capacity that it is now looking to deploy to third-party customers,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Ravi Shankar said in a client note on Wednesday, reacting to this story.\nAmazon\u2019s move toward offering wholesale capacity is a logical evolution for an integrated express carrier. FedEx, UPS and DHL Express for decades have offered wholesale capacity to outside shippers seeking a deferred delivery mode.\nSatish Jindel, CEO of parcel shipping analytics firm ShipMatrix, said Amazon will now compete with FedEx and UPS for traditional domestic airfreight.\n\u201cUPS and FedEx, in addition to parcel, they move airfreight domestically for customers and freight forwarders. So they\u2019re going to be an alternative to UPS and FedEx,\u201d he said. \u201cMore importantly, they have the resources to deploy more aircraft if they are successful.\u201d\nThe move to sell air cargo service is consistent with Amazon\u2019s rollout a year ago of a stand-alone shipping service under which the retail-tech giant uses its independent drivers to provide pickups at warehouses and handle the shipments to final delivery. In early 2023, Amazon opened eligibility for Buy with Prime to all e-commerce merchants, instead of by invite only. The program allows online sellers, including those that do not sell on the company\u2019s website, to offer Prime fulfillment services through their own online stores. The air cargo expansion also fits with a year-old global supply chain service, which involves picking up inventory from manufacturing facilities worldwide, booking the shipment with an ocean carrier, handling customs clearance and ground transportation, managing inventory replenishment, and making the final delivery. Supply Chain by Amazon leverages the company\u2019s position as a bulk buyer of ocean freight capacity.\nAmazon has been slow to expand the ground shipping beyond the initial 15 markets but will make a bigger push next year to do so, Jindel predicted.\nAmazon\u2019s success with third-party cargo will depend on the terms, conditions and pricing offered, because express carriers give their core business priority over forwarder cargo when space is tight, Brian Clancy, managing director of Logistics Capital & Strategy, told FreightWaves.\n\u201cThe Achilles heel in that strategy is that whenever you have a volume surge the first thing that gets kicked off the aircraft is wholesaler cargo. If you say we can\u2019t guarantee it [the shipment schedule], we have to roll it to the next day if we have an overload situation on certain lanes, the forwarders will throw up their hands and say I can beat that with point-to-point truck or I\u2019ll give it to Forward Air and they\u2019ll run it through their expedited less-than-truckload network,\u201d the veteran consultant said.\nMost forwarders tend to use express capacity for less urgent freight \u201cbecause when the planes aren\u2019t full, it\u2019s the best value equation. You will get the best service with the highest on-time performance, assuming you can use the capacity consistently,\u201d Clancy added.\nHe downplayed the potential effectiveness of commercializing Amazon Air in Europe, because it increasingly has become a trucking market, Amazon utilizes small 737-800 aircraft, and policymakers there are discouraging short-haul flights to meet strict carbon-reduction targets.\nMeanwhile, FedEx is beginning to downsize its domestic, daytime freighter network after the expiration of a major contract with the U.S. Postal Service, part of a broader reorganization of the air network designed to reduce costs. The logistics integrator will continue to provide daytime service for other customers, but flight activity will be tailored to better maximize aircraft utilization, officials have publicly stated. The reorganization also involves segmenting express parcels to overnight flights and international deferred freight to daytime departures so that warehouse workers can focus on processing high-yield priority packages without the distraction of handling large pallets at the same time.\nClick here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper articles by Eric Kulisch.\nWrite to Eric Kulisch at ekulisch@freightwaves.com.\nAmazon flying to generate 20% of Sun Country Airlines\u2019 revenue\nAmazon concentrates parcel freighters at US air hubs, report says\nAmazon\u2019s largest cargo jet makes debut\nThe post Amazon airline sells excess cargo capacity to third-party shippers appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

Per the research done by Bain, major cloud services providers were at the forefront of AI research and development, pushing the boundaries of larger models, advanced infrastructure, and energy efficiency. These hyperscalers were focusing on the development of larger, more complex models that demanded significant computational power and resources, leading to the need for data centers with energy capacities up to gigawatts, potentially straining energy grids and supply chains.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nBain underlined that while the big players dominated the high end of the market with expansive models and enormous data centers, innovation was also thriving in smaller models. These smaller, domain-specific models were being deployed at the edge, where they were more cost-effective, energy-efficient, and capable of addressing real-time processing needs, particularly in applications like autonomous driving. The proliferation of models like Llama, Claude, and Gemini illustrated how AI was evolving rapidly beyond just a few proprietary models, with many options now open-source or specialized for particular tasks.\nThe research further detailed that the rapid growth in AI workloads, particularly with data-heavy applications, was also reshaping the technology landscape. The need for increased storage, computing power, and memory was driving innovations in data center design, networking, and storage technologies. Per Bain, chip companies and particularly GPU makers were expanding beyond their core graphics processing units to include integrated solutions that improved the efficiency of AI models, with their products now combining compute, memory, and networking capabilities. The competition was also spurring the development of vertically integrated AI solutions, where tech companies designed everything from hardware to software to optimize AI performance.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To\u00a0and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

Claude is an array of large language models developed by Anthropic. The move comes after OpenAI, a rival of Anthropic, launched ChatGPT for Enterprise in August. Both companies offer monthly subscriptions to their AI tools. TechCrunch reports that the subscription for Claude would cost more than $30 per month. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has already pledged more than $4 billion towards the AI startup.\nCiti recently reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a $245 price target. Analysts at the advisory issued an investor note following a third party seller event named Amazon Accelerate. The note detailed that the advisory was incrementally confident that Amazon's core retail segment would continue to gain greater wallet share as fulfillment efficiencies lowered overall cost to serve. With faster shipping speeds, the rise in essentials, and improving conversion rates, Amazon's core retail business would deliver continued share gains and expanding margins as Web Services demand accelerated, the note underlined.\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Talha Qureshi ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable in 2024. In this article, we will look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable.\nMalcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, joined CNBC to talk about where the market could go and his sentiment regarding the AI and overall tech sector. While many analysts believe that it will be the small caps that will lead the growth with interest rates easing and the economy slowing down. We recently covered the\u00a08 Most Undervalued Penny Stocks To Buy According To Analysts, where we talked about how Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors likes the small cap in the current market environment. Here\u2019s a piece from the article:\n\u201cTo talk about what the stock market looks like today and in the near future. Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors joined CNBC in a recent interview. He has been one of the strong proponents and supporters of small-cap stocks. Lee says that we are in a volatile environment currently, due to a few reasons, one being the elections in less than 30 days, the second being the Middle Eastern crisis which is scaring investors, and lastly the port strike that has the potential to cripple the economy. However, he still expressed his optimism that the year-end has a lot of tailwinds and investors shouldn\u2019t be afraid to buy the dip. Moreover, Lee also highlighted that these current events are all short-term headwinds in a buying cycle and are expected to die down quickly.\nEthridge thinks otherwise, he believes that mega-cap stocks will continue to lead market growth, although not at the same pace as in recent years but still at a steady pace. He attributes this to the ongoing influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on various sectors, including real estate and manufacturing, which are becoming increasingly vital due to rising demands on infrastructure.\nMoreover, while explaining why the mega caps will lead the growth, Ethridge pointed out that for the big tech stocks, Fed rate cuts were not necessary as they had significant cash on their balance sheets to reinvest into newer AI ventures. We have already seen Magnificent Seven invest heavily in AI despite the high rate of borrowing thereby leading the bull market in difficult times.\nThe rate cuts have now made it easy for other companies that didn\u2019t have enough cash to borrow and invest in technology. However, he also pointed out that the pace of rate cuts might slow down moving forward, thereby making it hard for small caps to keep up the technology investment race. Ethridge suggests that investors may need to adjust their expectations regarding future Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nMoreover, we are also entering earnings season, will the earnings derail the momentum or continue to boost the market? Drew Pettit, Citi Research Director of US Equity Strategy joined CNBC in another interview. He thinks that we are in for a decent quarter, although we are in an expensive market.\nWhile talking about how various sectors will perform, Pettit mentioned that software has the highest bar within tech, meaning its growth expectations are high, yet many software companies are not monetizing effectively. This creates volatility in stock performance. As earnings reports come in, Pettit suggests investors should focus on consumer behavior and credit conditions, particularly in the banking sector, which is expected to perform well this quarter. He also encouraged investors to look beyond the recent quarter earnings into 2025 and 2026, while choosing companies to invest in.\nOur Methodology\nTo curate the list of 10 high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable in 2024 we used the Finviz stock screener, Seeking Alpha, and Yahoo Finance as our sources. Using the stock screener, we got an initial list of major NASDAQ stocks sorted by their market capitalization. Next, we sourced the 5-year net income growth and revenue growth rates for these stocks from Seeking Alpha and the GAAP trailing twelve-month net income from Yahoo Finance. We only selected stocks that had 5-year net income and revenue growth of more than 15%. Lastly, we ranked the stocks by the number of hedge fund holders in Q2 2024 from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n5-Year Net Income Growth: 29.71%\n5-Year Revenue Growth: 19.11%\nTTM Net Income: $44.42 Billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an international technology company known for its online retail services. Its retail services include online shopping platforms and physical stores. The company also engages in cloud computing services through its Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is one of the major parts of its business.\nThe company has taken strategic measures to adopt artificial intelligence across its business offerings. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had to face some challenges due to an all-time high inflation rate, however, the recent interest rate cuts and changing consumer sentiment have helped the company a lot. During the second quarter of 2024, it improved its net sales by 10% year-over-year to reach $148 billion and as a result, its earnings per share nearly doubled to $1.26.\nThe company\u2019s cloud business has also done well due to the recent AI integration and jumped 19% year-over-year. The strategic edge of the company comes from its market share which stands at around 38% of the online retail sales in the United States and with the easing cycle from the Fed the share and sales are only expected to grow further.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the best high-growth NASDAQ stock that is profitable in 2024, we say this because not only has the company generated $44.4 billion in net income during the past 12 months but has also grown its free cash flow by 572% year-over-year.\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) continued growth is driven by its strong performance in AWS and advertising, which grew 19% and 20%, respectively. E-commerce growth moderated to 9.3%, likely due to softer consumer demand.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nThe AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification.\nAnother notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion. A recent report by Goldman Sachs reveals that businesses worldwide are projected to spend nearly $1 trillion in the coming years on building AI infrastructure. The report underscores the massive scale of investment needed to meet the growing demand for AI technologies across various industries. In 2024 alone, venture capital firms have already completed around 200 deals with AI companies, pouring in nearly $22 billion in funding. The average size of these funding rounds exceeds $100 million, reflecting the increasing valuation of AI startups, which now often surpass $1 billion.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "Author": "PR Newswire ",
        "Text": "SMR development could play a pivotal role in an 'all-of-the-above' energy solution to meet robust electricity demand growth\nAgreement will explore innovative commercial and financing structures to advance a potential project\nDominion Energy committed to the credit and risk profile objectives of the recently concluded business review\nRICHMOND, Va., Oct. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Dominion Energy Virginia and Amazon have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to explore innovative new development structures that would help advance potential Small Modular Reactor (SMR) nuclear development in Virginia.\nAs power demand grows at an unprecedented pace in Virginia and other regions in the U.S., utilities, state and federal agencies, and leading technology firms are exploring SMRs as a potential solution that would provide reliable, carbon-free power.\nPower demand in Virginia is growing by more than 5% annually and is expected to double in the next 15 years. To reliably serve this unprecedented growth, Dominion Energy is developing an 'all-of-the-above' mix of new power generation sources, including leading investments in offshore wind, solar, battery storage and natural gas.\nIn the 2030s, SMRs could play a pivotal role in this 'all-of-the-above' energy mix. Like traditional nuclear, SMRs generate around-the-clock, carbon-free power, but with a significantly smaller footprint and lower upfront capital costs.\nThe MOU between Dominion Energy Virginia and Amazon documents the companies' efforts to jointly explore innovative ways to advance SMR development and financing while also mitigating potential cost and development risks for customers and capital providers. Dominion Energy remains committed to the credit and risk profile objectives of the recently concluded business review.\n\"This agreement builds on our longstanding partnership with Amazon and other leading tech companies to accelerate the development of carbon-free power generation in Virginia,\" said Robert M. Blue, Chair, President and CEO of Dominion Energy. \"It's an important step forward in serving our customers' growing needs with reliable, affordable and increasingly clean energy. This collaboration gives us a potential path to advance SMRs with minimal rate impacts for our residential customers and substantially reduced development risk.\"\n\"Bringing new sources of carbon-free energy to the grid is an important part of Amazon's commitment to serve our customers and achieve net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040,\" said Kevin Miller, Amazon's Vice President of Global Data Centers. \"Nuclear energy is safe, reliable, and can help meet the energy needs of our customers for decades to come. We're excited to innovate alongside Dominion to explore the opportunities that Small Modular Reactors can bring to Virginia, while also helping us all address climate change.\"\n\"In alignment with our All-American, All-of-the-Above energy plan, small modular nuclear reactors will play a critical role in positioning Virginia as a leading nuclear innovation hub,\" said Governor Glenn Youngkin. \"Amazon Web Services' commitment to this technology and their partnership with Dominion is a significant step forward to meet the future power needs of a growing Virginia.\"\n\"The world around us is changing very quickly,\" said U.S. Senator Mark Warner. \"Advances in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing stand to revolutionize our daily lives, but they also stand to push our energy needs beyond anything we've ever seen before. Virginia is already a leader in nuclear energy, which is why I'm thrilled to see Dominion Energy and Amazon partner up to build the next generation of SMRs right here at home.\"\n\"I'm glad Dominion and Amazon have come to this exciting agreement to diversify our clean energy options,\" said U.S. Senator Tim Kaine. \"From offshore wind to nuclear energy, Virginia is well positioned to be a leader in energy innovation and job creation. I will continue to do all that I can to make sure we are harnessing that opportunity, including by encouraging other companies to utilize the clean energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act that I'm proud to have helped pass.\"\nIn July, Dominion Energy announced a Request for Proposals (RFP) from leading SMR nuclear technology companies to evaluate the feasibility of developing an SMR at the company's North Anna Power Station in Louisa County, Va.\u00a0 While the RFP is not a commitment to build an SMR at North Anna, it is an important first step in evaluating the technology and the feasibility of developing it at North Anna.\nAbout Dominion Energy\nDominion Energy (NYSE: D), headquartered in Richmond, Va., provides regulated electricity service to 3.6 million\u00a0homes and businesses in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, and regulated natural gas service to 400,000 customers in South Carolina. The company is\u00a0one of the nation's leading developers and operators of regulated offshore wind\u00a0and solar\u00a0power and the largest producer of carbon-free electricity in New England.

        "Title": "Dave Clark made Amazon a logistics powerhouse. Now he\u2019s raised $100 million to help Fortune 500s perfect their supply chains too",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "In over two decades at Amazon, Dave Clark oversaw the transformation of the online retailer into a shipping and delivery giant, before rising to the No. 2 executive role alongside founder Jeff Bezos and eventually Bezos\u2019s successor, Andy Jassy.\nNow Clark is channeling that lifetime of experience, plus learnings from a brief, turbulent stint atop supply-chain startup Flexport, to bet on himself.\nClark founded a new AI-powered supply-chain startup called Auger this summer, and has raised $100 million in Series A funding entirely from the investment firm Oak HC/FT, he told Fortune in an interview on Monday. Clark\u2019s aim is to help midsize enterprises with global supply chains\u2014think the Fortune 500 outside of the top 50\u2014integrate various supply-chain systems, and their data, from different providers into a single operating system that looks more like a consumer app than a clunky enterprise solution.\n\u201cThe software doesn\u2019t really talk to each other; a friend of mine calls it Franken software,\u201d Clark says of traditional supply-chain systems. \u201cThe pieces all come together but don\u2019t [work] together, and so people end up setting up teams of analysts with Excel. A shocking amount of the world\u2019s supply chain actually runs on Excel.\u201d\nWith Auger, Clark aims to let business users get real-time answers to pressing questions around shipments, forecasting, and other critical areas through simple text queries. Such visibility should help increase a supply chain\u2019s efficiency while lowering costs, Clark believes.\n\u201cHow do we allow companies to run their supply chains with the same level of simplicity and elegance as the consumer applications that they use every day?\u201d Clark asked rhetorically. \u201cThe technology totally exists to do that, and I think it just hasn\u2019t been put together.\u201d\nClark says the sweet spot for an Auger customer will be companies that have global supply chains but aren\u2019t so large as to employ massive in-house technology divisions. The startup will likely focus its efforts on U.S.-based companies initially, but hopes to eventually expand beyond that including into the government and defense spaces.\nClark moved back to Washington State from Texas to launch Auger, which is headquartered in Bellevue. The startup plans to grow to 30 to 40 employees in the next six months, according to a spokesperson. Auger hasn\u2019t yet released a product nor has Clark decided which AI model or models the startup would use.\nClark spent 23 years at Amazon, retiring from the company in 2022 as CEO of its global consumer business, where he reported to Amazon CEO Bezos and later to his successor, Jassy. Clark spent almost a decade of his time at Amazon in roles more or less equivalent to a chief supply-chain officer, launching and scaling Amazon\u2019s last-mile delivery network and laying the foundation for a new regional warehouse structure that the company says has helped increase shipping speeds.\nClark left Amazon for the CEO job at freight software startup Flexport, in part owing to friction with Jassy, his new boss. But Clark spent just a year at the startup before Flexport founder Ryan Petersen pushed him and his deputies out in a dramatic, befuddling move.\nClark, who says he hasn\u2019t spoken to Petersen or Jassy anytime recently, had reportedly been considering a run for Texas governor in 2026. But he tells Fortune that he had decided not to throw his hat in the ring after Gov. Greg Abbott announced earlier this year that he intended to run for reelection. \u201cHe\u2019s a great governor,\u201d Clark says of Abbott, though he notes that he hopes to eventually get into politics, in part because of his disillusionment with career politicians.\n\u201cMuch of the problems we talk about today, whether immigration or anything else, are highly solvable problems that rational people on both sides share probably 80% or 90% of the same objectives and cannot get the ball across the line because it\u2019s just too good politically for their careers to fight,\u201d he says. \u201cI think if you have a world where politicians \u2026 that\u2019s not their career \u2026 you have a higher probability of solving some of these intractable issues that linger and create lots of dysfunction in the world.\u201d\nAs for the impetus behind Auger, Clark says he had visions of tackling a similar problem at Flexport.\n\u201cI went to Flexport with this idea that we could build the same kind of things we built at Amazon but for other businesses,\u201d Clark notes. \u201cAnd that was kind of the intent when I went there, but we ended up not aligned on the mission in the same way.\u201d\nNow he gets a second chance. With a $100 million war chest behind him.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) data centers are one of the hottest topics on Wall Street as companies across the industrial spectrum compete in a race to deploy AI technologies in their operations. The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers. Hyperscale data centers are the largest in the industry, typically developed by technology giants based in the US, and offer massive networking capacity and often consume as much power as a big city or even a small country.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nAs technology stocks stage a comeback on the back of Fed rate cuts and AI optimism, the news coming from the commerce department in the US has buoyed investors further. The US government said earlier this week that it plans to award nearly $100 million to boost the use of artificial intelligence in developing new sustainable semiconductor materials. The funding is part of the more than $52 billion in US chip manufacturing and research grants promised by US President Joe Biden. The latest funding would go towards helping universities, national laboratories, and the private sector develop AI-powered autonomous experimentation for sustainable semiconductor manufacturing. The goal is to reduce time needed to develop new semiconductor materials that are less resource-intensive.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Investment advisory Bernstein recently referenced the company in an investor note detailing that AI infrastructure spending by tech giants is expected to reach a combined total of $160 billion in 2024. The note was released as the advisory sought to clarify that training AI models required higher budget allocations as opposed to inferencing. According to an analysis by Bernstein, inference only accounted for 5% of AI infrastructure spending. Bernstein referenced ChatGPT by OpenAI as an example, noting that GPT-2 was trained on a cluster of chips costing about $3 million, while GPT-3 required about $30 million worth of hardware to train. GPT-4 was then trained on 25,000 A100s, which cost about $300 million.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we will look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks among the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio.\nRay Dalio was born in 1949 and graduated from Long Island University in 1971. After a brief stint as a clerk on the New York Stock Exchange, he attended Harvard Business School and earned his MBA in 1973. That same year, he became the Director of Commodities at Dominick & Dominick LLC and later traded futures at Shearson Hayden Stone for a year. Dalio founded\u00a0Bridgewater Associates\u00a0in 1973 in his apartment. In July 2011, he stepped down as CEO but continued to work as a co-CIO alongside Robert Prince and Greg Jensen, taking on the title of \u201cMentor.\u201d\nBridgewater Associates is notable for its focus on transparency and accountability. The firm promotes a culture where team members take responsibility for mistakes and learn from them. It encourages questioning and alignment, ensuring everyone regularly evaluates the validity of their ideas. This approach is crucial to the firm\u2019s management style and investment strategies.\nRay Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, emphasized that since 1945, the United States has been the dominant global empire, but it is now in a state of relative decline. This decline isn\u2019t just an opinion, it\u2019s supported by concrete measures such as the nation\u2019s share of global GDP, military strength, and the quality of its education system. These factors indicate that the U.S. is losing its position.\nIn addition to these, Dalio points out two other key elements that often disrupt world order: natural events like droughts, floods, and pandemics, which have historically caused more damage and upheaval than wars, and human creativity and technological innovation, which bring about substantial changes. Dalio believes all five factors are influencing the U.S. today. However, he stresses that the most critical issue is how people manage these challenges together.\nThe ability to address them intelligently and without creating further conflict is essential. If conflict arises, it could lead to a devastating outcome. But if people can come together and handle the situation effectively, the country can navigate these issues successfully. For Dalio, how society deals with one another is the number one factor in determining the future.\nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Ray Dalio also highlighted significant issues in China that have emerged over the past four years. He explained that China is in need of a major restructuring, as a large portion of individual spending, around 70%, was invested in real estate. With the decline in real estate, stocks, and salaries, people have become more cautious, reducing their spending and holding onto cash. In a deflationary environment, cash has become a relatively safe asset. This situation is affecting both households and businesses.\nDalio also pointed out that the government sector is facing serious challenges. Local governments, responsible for 83% of public spending, previously relied on land sales to generate revenue. With land sales drying up, these governments have accumulated significant debt, and now they\u2019re struggling to pay it off. The key question is how to inject money into these local economies to keep them functioning. Dalio compared the situation to Japan\u2019s struggles in 1990, noting that China\u2019s challenges are even more severe and will require deep restructuring to resolve.\nIn addition to economic concerns, Dalio raised questions about property ownership and values. He referenced Deng Xiaoping\u2019s famous statement, \u201cIt\u2019s glorious to be rich,\u201d and wondered if that sentiment still holds true in China today. The overall environment in the country is becoming more complex and difficult, as these economic and political issues intensify.\nDalio also emphasized the importance of being cautious when investing in China. He made it clear that every country goes through economic cycles, experiencing both highs and lows. According to Dalio, it\u2019s crucial not to invest too heavily in any one country, including China, to avoid having it dominate your portfolio. Despite the challenges China faces, Dalio continues to invest there, but he stressed that the key consideration is the size and structure of the investment. Overall, his experience investing in China has been positive, though careful management is essential.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates\u2019 Q2 2024 13F portfolio and picked the top 10 stocks held by the fund. We also added the total number of hedge fund investors per company, as of Q2 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of Bridgewater Associates\u2019 stake in them.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) has a bright outlook, supported by strong financial results and smart strategies for growth. In Q2 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported revenues of $144.5 billion, a 12% increase from the previous year, with net income reaching $7.9 billion. This growth came from solid performances in both e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), which generated $26.4 billion in revenue, up 15%, showing its strength in the cloud computing market.\nA major reason for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s success is its continuous investment in logistics and fulfillment. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expanding its delivery network, including new centers and advanced technology, which improves customer satisfaction and helps it gain more market share. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s advertising business is thriving, with revenue reaching $12.2 billion in Q2 2024, a 21% increase, as more brands invest in digital marketing on its platform.\nMoreover, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is making strides in artificial intelligence to enhance customer experiences, offering personalized recommendations and better search features. Overall, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s strong financial performance, focus on improving logistics and advertising, and commitment to technology position it well for future growth and success.\nBridgewater Associates owns 2,645,567 shares of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), worth $511.3 million.\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor\u00a0letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon\u2019s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.\u201d\nOverall, AMZN ranks 4th on our list of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) climbed higher on Friday, adding as much as 3.1%. As of 2:27 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 1.6%.\nThe catalyst that sent the e-commerce and cloud computing titan higher was a bullish take from a Wall Street analyst.\nJMP Securities analyst Nicholas Jones maintained an outperform (buy) rating on Amazon stock while setting a price target of $265. That represents additional upside potential of 46% compared to Thursday's closing price. The analyst believes Amazon can cut its expenses by more than $20 billion each year by making a few changes to its business.\nJones suggested that strategic use of autonomous technology and replacing its vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE) with electric vans from Rivian Automotive will dramatically cut Amazon's delivery costs. The analyst estimates that fuel expenses make up between 25% and 30% of the cost per mile of the company's middle- and last-mile deliveries, and relying on electric vehicles will cut per-mile energy costs by half over the long term.\nAs Amazon continues to swap out its current ICE vehicles for electric, it could potentially save as much as $7 billion annually over the short term, according to the analyst.\nAmazon already has 15,000 Rivian electric delivery vans in its fleet, with plans to increase that number to 100,000 by 2030.\nRecent improvements in the economy could also benefit Amazon. Waning inflation and lower interest rates will give consumers greater spending power and additional discretionary income, some of which will be spent on Amazon's online retail site. It will also spur additional spending by businesses, which will no doubt increase spending on Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud infrastructure service. The rebounding economy is also providing fuel for Amazon's digital advertising business, which is the company's fastest-growing segment.\nLet's not forget the accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), which will positively impact all of Amazon's primary businesses. While estimates vary, generative AI is expected to be a $1.3 trillion market by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence -- and that's one of the more conservative estimates.\nAmazon stock is currently selling for less than 3 times next year's sales. In light of the myriad opportunities to thrive, that represents a compelling opportunity.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "When it comes to growth potential over time, few stocks have matched Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The e-commerce pioneer has evolved from an online bookseller to a conglomerate that leads the way in several niches of retail and technology.\nIn hindsight, if one had the patience to wait and the fortitude to ride out massive declines, a $1,000 investment in the company's initial public offering (IPO) would have paid off handsomely for shareholders.\nA $1,000 investment at the closing price on the day of the IPO and not sold would be worth roughly $1.87 million today. The stock made its debut on May 15, 1997, at a pre-split closing price of $23.50 per share ($0.098 per share split-adjusted). Assuming one could buy fractional shares, the 42.55 shares bought on that day would have grown to 10,212 shares worth $182.69 each as of the time of this writing.\nThose who owned the stock for the entire 27-year history haven't been on a predictable or easy path.\nInvestors may have anticipated Amazon would venture beyond the sale of just books, it was next to impossible to predict the huge variety of products it would sell or that it would spearhead the cloud computing industry through Amazon Web Services (AWS). This is critical because AWS generates the majority of its operating income.\nInvestors also endured a brutal sell-off during the dot-com bust. Between 1999 and 2001, Amazon's stock fell as much as 95% and didn't return to its 1999 high until 2009.\nFor a time, that drop made it look more like many of the failed online retailers at the time. Hence, investors would have had to have a strong belief in the vision of founder Jeff Bezos to hold their shares through that period.\nUltimately, the history of Amazon stock outlines both the rewards and the difficulties of IPO investing. While the potential returns can be massive, it typically takes vision, analysis skills, discipline, and a high pain tolerance to identify such investments early and allow them to grow to their full potential.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) which saw its share price drive 115% higher over five years.\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n Check out our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Amazon.com achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 28% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 17% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\nWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Amazon.com's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nWe're pleased to report that Amazon.com shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 46% over one year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 17% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Before deciding if you like the current share price, check how Amazon.com scores on these 3 valuation metrics.\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of undervalued small caps that insiders are buying.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Michael McCann ",
        "Text": "The NBA has fired another salvo against a longtime broadcast partner whose impending divorce from the league has spawned a major legal battle.\nThe NBA on Wednesday filed a brief urging New York Judge Joel M. Cohen to dismiss TBS and Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s breach of contract lawsuit. The brief responds to a recent filing by the plaintiffs in which they\u00a0attempt to convince\u00a0Cohen to deny the NBA\u2019s motion to dismiss.\nMore from Sportico.com\nNBA, WNBA Sign Castrol as New League-Wide Sponsor\nBrooklyn Nets Jersey Patch Sponsor Targets Tourists Worldwide\nCeltics' Jaylen Brown Launches Shoe Brand After Nike Spat\nThe lawsuit revolves around a fundamental question: Did the NBA lawfully determine that TBS failed to match Amazon\u2019s offer to broadcast games from 2025-26 through 2035-36?\nThe NBA and TBS have offered competing interpretations of contract law, specifically what counts as a \u201cmatch\u201d and what is better understood as a \u201ccounteroffer.\u201d\nThrough Richard C. Pepperman II and other attorneys from Sullivan & Cromwell as well as NBA executives Richard W. Buchanan and Daniel J. Spillane, the NBA argues that under the \u201cunambiguous terms\u201d of the NBA/TBS contract signed in 2014, TBS \u201chad no right\u201d to match Amazon\u2019s offer to distribute games versus streaming.\nThe league adds that even if TBS did possess such a right, it failed to successfully invoke it.\n\u201cTBS revised eight of the Amazon offer\u2019s 27 sections, changed 11 definitions, struck nearly 300 words, and added over 270 new words,\u201d the NBA wrote. \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 redline was a counteroffer, not a match. That should be the end of this case.\u201d\nTo that point, the NBA says that TBS could have matched a term in Amazon\u2019s offer wherein Amazon pledged to promote NBA telecasts during Thursday Night Football. According to the NBA, TBS could have matched that term by simply negotiating advertising deals for Thursday Night Football.\nIn what the NBA describes as TBS\u2019 counteroffer (TBS calls it a match), TBS inserted a \u201cmajor sporting league\u201d event, rather than necessarily Thursday Night Football, as an acceptable condition for promoting NBA telecasts. That alteration, the NBA maintains, substantively changed Amazon\u2019s term. \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d presumably means \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d rather than NASCAR races, regular season MLB and NHL games, and other possible sporting events that are not, the NBA says, \u201ccommercially equivalent\u201d to TNF.\nThe NBA adds other arguments, including its position that TBS lacks contractual authority to distribute NBA games separate from TNT. That is why, the NBA contends, TBS \u201cneeded\u201d a \u201cseparate Digital Rights Agreement\u201d (DRA). The DRA, which contains no matching right, permitted \u201cBleacher Report to distribute individual TNT telecasts of NBA games via Max, WBD\u2019s SVOD service.\u201d The NBA insists that if their agreement with TBS gave TBS the right to distribute games on Max, \u201cthe DRA would have been unnecessary.\u201d\nThe NBA also emphasizes that Amazon\u2019s offer \u201cdid not allow for distribution via cable television.\u201d TBS\u2019 attempt to match the Amazon offer \u201cchanged its terms to permit exactly that,\u201d which the NBA contends \u201cinvalidated\u201d TBS\u2019 attempted match.\nThe brief also portrays TBS as attempting to overcomplicate and convolute what the league says is relatively straightforward language. The plaintiff is accused of doing so to suggest there is a meaningful interpretive dispute that ought to advance the case past a motion to dismiss so there can be further clarification.\nFor example, the NBA takes issue with TBS \u201crepeatedly\u201d noting its matching rights \u201cextend\u201d to a \u201csubset of TBS\u2019 Cable Rights.\u201d The league maintains Amazon\u2019s offer contemplates rights that are not any \u201csubset\u201d of cable rights since, in the context of a streaming service, \u201cthey are not cable rights at all.\u201d\nSimilarly, the NBA stresses that Prime Video \u201cis an Internet streaming service,\u201d whereas \u201cTNT is a cable television network.\u201d And, as the NBA tells it, its agreement with TBS from a decade ago uses the term \u201cdistribution\u201d to mean method of transmissions\u2014and\u00a0not\u00a0which device a person uses to watch the transmission.\nFurther, the NBA contends that WBD \u201cis not a proper party\u201d for the litigation. Although WBD has agreed to guarantee TBS\u2019 payments, it allegedly \u201clacks standing to enforce its subsidiary\u2019s contractual rights.\u201d\nAs detailed in previous\u00a0stories, TBS and WBD have raised counterarguments. Should Cohen advance the litigation, it is expected to go to trial next April.\nBest of Sportico.com\nCollege Athletes as Employees: Answering 25 Key Questions\nSign up for Sportico's Newsletter.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Mastercard Incorporated MA recently entered into a multi-year commercial partnership with Amazon Payment Services to enhance digital payment acceptance across the Middle East and Africa (MEA). Per the deal, MA will provide its Mastercard Gateway solution, a single touchpoint for payment processing. It is available in 40 markets across the region.\nIt will enable fast, seamless and secure transactions in the said markets. The partnership aims to benefit Amazon Payment Services\u2019 merchants and expand their reach, while also co-developing innovative payment solutions like Secure Card on File, Click to Pay and token authentication services.\nCountries expected to benefit from this deal include South Africa, UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, Lebanon, Oman, Jordan, Kuwait and Qatar. By partnering with Amazon Payment Services, Mastercard can significantly expand its presence across the MEA, covering some key growing markets. The deal will increase the adoption of its payment processing technology.\nThe integration will likely attract a broader base of merchants, including Amazon\u2019s online stores, while also opening up new synergies with other sectors such as telecom and government entities. With the growing demand for digital payment solutions, partnering with a major player like Amazon Payment Services strengthens Mastercard\u2019s reputation as an innovative and reliable payment provider in emerging markets.\nMore merchants using Mastercard\u2019s technology translates to higher transaction volumes, which can drive revenue growth through fees and service offerings. The Mastercard Payment Industry Insights Index revealed that 95% of consumers in the MEA are open to using new payment options like QR codes, wearables, digital wallets, biometrics and contactless payments.\nMoreover, a majority (61%) would avoid shops that don\u2019t accept electronic payments. It also mentions that banks that switched to digital services have seen digital transactions grow significantly, jumping from 70% to 90% in just about two years. This trend shows a strong shift towards digital payments in the region. As such, the new deal can be a game-changer for both consumers and merchants in the MEA region, as well as Mastercard, who\u2019ll benefit from the growth in digitization.\nThis partnership will also enable Amazon Payment Services to scale faster, offer superior technology, and create a more robust and comprehensive payment ecosystem in the region.\nShares of Mastercard have gained 23.5% in the past year compared with the\u00a0industry\u2019s 22.1% growth.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMastercard currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nInvestors can also look at some better-ranked stocks from the broader\u00a0Business Services\u00a0space, like\u00a0Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

        "Title": "Amazon targets faster deliveries and buying with new tech",
        "Author": "  Greg Bensinger ",
        "Text": "By Greg Bensinger\nNASHVILLE, Tennessee (Reuters) - Amazon, in its quest for greater efficiency, has developed new systems to shave seconds off each package delivery and to help customers make faster buying choices, even for new product types that they may know little about.\nThe company announced Wednesday it has created spotlights within its trucks to guide delivery people to packages for each stop along a route.\nThe technology, which Amazon is calling Vision Assisted Package Retrieval, works by shining a green light on packages so that the deliverer does not have to waste precious seconds reading labels.\n\u201cWhen we speed up deliveries, customers shop more,\u201d said Doug Herrington, CEO of Amazon worldwide stores in remarks at the event. \u201cOnce a customer experiences fast delivery, they will come back sooner and shop more.\u201d\nAmazon said it would equip 1,000 active delivery trucks, supplied by EV maker Rivian, with the spotlight tech early next year. Herrington said the delivery van ceilings are equipped with cameras and LED projectors that instantly read package labels so it knows which are bound for which customers.\nAmazon is Rivian's largest shareholder and has placed orders for 100,000 electric delivery vans to be deployed by 2030.\nShares of Amazon and Rivian were up about 1% each in morning trade.\nThe new system calls to mind a technology widely deployed in Amazon\u2019s warehouses that shines a light on items on robotically wheeled shelves so workers can pick them and put them in bins. That system replaced one that had some workers walking up to 10 miles a day pushing carts through narrow aisles to find stowed items.\nShortening by a few seconds the time it takes for each package delivery means Amazon can increase the number of deliveries each worker makes in a shift. Today, Amazon said, delivery workers reach about 100 customers each day.\nAt an event held at a warehouse near Nashville, Tennessee, Amazon also said it is using new artificial intelligence software that can reduce the need to spend minutes or hours researching new products, such as televisions and dog food. The online guides will include more extensive information, as well as recommendations, so that customers can make more informed decisions more quickly, the Seattle company said.\nThe new feature follows one announced earlier this year putting an AI search into the main Amazon website. Called Rufus, it gives users longer answers to search queries.\nSeparately, Amazon announced it was planning smaller warehouses attached to its Whole Foods grocery stores so that when items are not offered there customers will not be tempted to shop at competing stores. That way, shoppers could order a bottle of Pepsi while shopping at a Whole Foods, which doesn\u2019t carry the soft drink, and have that brought to them when they check out.\nThe first such store is in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania \u2013 about 15 miles north of Philadelphia \u2013 which will start offering the service sometime next year.\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Nick Zieminski)\n"

        "Author": "  John Kell ",
        "Text": "With a dozen years at Amazon under his belt, Deepak Bhatia made a big career change last year when he joined Hershey as the candymaker\u2019s first-ever chief technology officer.\n\u201cThe goal is not to simply take things that were at Amazon and bring them over,\u201d says Bhatia, whose last role at the e-commerce giant was vice president of supply-chain optimization technologies.\nHe asserts that not all of the technology applications that worked at Amazon, which has expertise in cloud computing, robotics, and generative artificial intelligence, can also be applied to Hershey\u2014a consumer packaged goods company that produces, manufactures, and sells the namesake candy bar, Twizzlers, Kit Kat, and other snacks.\nBut there are lessons learned at Amazon that he does plan to infuse at Hershey, particularly around automating tasks within the foodmaker\u2019s manufacturing supply chain and inventory management. Some other areas of focus for Bhatia as CTO include investing in data science, forecasting, cybersecurity, and more precise spending on marketing and in-store promotions.\nAs Hershey looks to rely more on data for those decisions, which at times may be automated, humans will remain firmly in the loop. \u201cWe have to balance it with a measured level of skepticism in the machine output and not just blindly trust it,\u201d says Bhatia.\nHe\u2019s particularly excited about how gen AI can help generate marketing assets and develop new snacking innovations, while also bolstering productivity with AI-enabled agents, copilots, and assistants to take on more mundane tasks.\nTo get the workforce up to speed, Bhatia says Hershey offers tech courses online, but a bigger transformation is underway within the technology group, where there is less focus on a project-by-project approach and more emphasis on empowering tech leaders to collaborate and create solutions for the business.\nWhile Bhatia is truly excited about gen AI, his approach is not to throw the technology at everything. He wants to start with simple solutions and add complexity when it is justified: \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019ve seen a lot of these new technologies generate a lot of value over time.\u201d\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nYou are the first-ever CTO at Hershey. What led them to create the role, and what were the priorities you laid out? \nWe\u2019ve had CIOs before, but the first CTO is a strong message and gives the status to the role that it deserves in terms of what we want technology to do. First and foremost, with our people and talent, and what should be in house [versus] what should be external. Our preference is going to be investing in talent and capabilities that will future-proof us. Second, which I think is underestimated, is the value of data. The focus on data\u2014making good quality data accessible and modernizing the tech\u2014this is where our investments are going to be.\nHow are you remaking the company and the tech teams to help make a difference across the business?\nCore to this is obviously having the right talent. But how we organize is equally important. We are working very actively to reorganize, and that\u2019s obviously going to be a journey. That can be anything from how we do end-to-end planning, including sales and operations, to supply chain. Other examples can be, how do we better spend and optimize our trade promotions and media spending and get the most bang for our buck? And the third is a never-ending desire to better understand the customer and better understand the categories and competition.\nWhat is the status of Hershey\u2019s generative AI journey?\nIn the near term, there is huge potential that gen AI has in terms of agents, assistants, and pilots that really augment what people can do, automate it, and make it faster. We are investing a lot in gen AI in the application of how we do promotions, marketing, and content generation. It is the beginning of the journey, and the effects of this will manifest in the years to come. We are making huge investments not only in terms of technology, but also how we organize ourselves and how we invest in talent.\nDo you have generative AI in production today or are you still in test and pilot mode?\u00a0\nWe are starting to test and pilot a lot of gen AI applications at the same time. If you have gen AI being used as a pilot in getting ideation and marketing content generation, then I would consider this to be more than a pilot. But it\u2019s hard to say how much of a role that particular work stream you can attribute to gen AI versus what the actual experts are working on. Keep in mind, the sweet spot for a lot of these applications and technologies right now, especially on the generative side, is how they can augment or scale the ideation process.\nWhat do you think about the cost of generative AI and balancing those costs with the outcomes you want to achieve?\nThere have been huge investments that have been made by a lot of big companies in gen AI. The monetization hasn\u2019t yet been completely figured out. What you will see is that there will be a few iterations of a pricing model and different solution providers will experiment and figure out a really effective way to monetize. It has to happen with the amount of investments that have been made on this entire ecosystem. But I think it\u2019s very early to know how that will happen, and likely a one-size-fits-all strategy won\u2019t end up manifesting.\nWhat is your favorite Hershey snack?\u00a0\nI love our dark chocolate Kit Kat. But there\u2019s a Hershey golden almond bar that\u2019s only available in Hershey\u2019s stores. If you get a chance to go to one of our physical stores, get one of those dark chocolate almond bars. I buy boatloads of them and bring them back home.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Amazon has shut down three more stores featuring its Just Walk Out technology, but the company says it remains committed to building out that technology as an offering for third-party merchants.\nThe e-commerce giant closed three of its Go convenience stores in New York last week, The Information confirmed on Friday, leaving just 17 across the nation. (Amazon notes it recently opened one in Washington.) These convenience stores use AI systems to track what customers pick up, allowing them to buy items without ever having to formally check out with a cashier. Since 2023, Amazon has cut the number of Go storefronts it operates nearly in half. In a statement, the company said it closed these particular stores for economic reasons. \"In this case, while these three stores were performing well, we couldn't make the economics work with the lease cost, so we've decided not to renew and have closed these locations,\" a spokesperson said.\nAmazon pulled Just Walk Out technology from its next-generation grocery stores earlier this year, saying at the time it would focus more on smaller grab-and-go shops \u2013 but maybe not its own. Amazon licenses Just Walk Out technology to lots of third party convenience stores, and Amazon says it's still committed to the Go format and technology as a whole.\nUpdate: This story has been updated to reflect the reason Amazon closed these stores. \nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/amazon-closes-more-of-its-cashierless-convenience-stores/\n"

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Grocery Dive newsletter. \nRecommended Reading \nAmazon Fresh breaks the 50-store mark\nAmazon announced Wednesday it has rolled out numerous initiatives that aim to streamline shopping for Prime members across its Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market storefronts.\u00a0\nCurrently, the company is piloting a new feature in its Phoenix market that enables Prime members to shop for grocery items alongside Amazon.com products and have them delivered together.\u00a0\nAmazon is also diversifying its fulfillment operations by modifying 26 Amazon Fresh fulfillment centers to include popular Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods and Amazon.com products. The company is also building its first-ever automated micro-fulfillment center in a Pennsylvania Whole Foods store to bolster the location\u2019s product assortment.\nAmazon\u2019s new initiatives will allow its Prime members to bundle orders of grocery and non-grocery items to cut down on customers needing to visit multiple retailers to finish shopping trips both in-store and online, according to the announcement.\u00a0\nThe trial Amazon is running in Phoenix allows Prime members to shop for grocery essentials, including fresh items, alongside Amazon.com goods and have them delivered together \u201cin hours.\u201d The capability also gives shoppers access to the usual same-day delivery speed and selection of multiple delivery windows.\nAmazon plans to expand this model to more locations as it continues to \u201ctest and learn\u201d and anticipates more customers will continue to opt for same-day delivery from Amazon for grocery shopping, per the press release.\u00a0\nTo make shopping across departments easier, Amazon is bringing a wider range of products to its Amazon Fresh fulfillment centers. The company has already modified 26 centers globally to offer a larger assortment of Whole Foods and Amazon.com goods so Prime shoppers can add everything they need to a single online order. This also allows Amazon to offer a larger span of price tiers, the announcement noted.\u00a0\nBased on customer response, Amazon will continue to convert more fulfillment centers to this new model, according to the press release.\u00a0\nA Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, Whole Foods is also adjusting fulfillment operations to broaden its in-store and online selection. The location will mark Amazon\u2019s first automated micro-fulfillment center to supplement in-store goods with popular products from Amazon.com and Amazon Fresh, Amazon said.\u00a0\nThis change gives customers the option to buy online for delivery or pickup as well as shop in-store but also choose a wider array of products across various departments, the announcement noted. So, if a customer is shopping in the Whole Foods store and needs an item not carried on the shelf \u2014 like Pepsi \u2014 they can order it from the Amazon app and the product will be prepared in the backroom and available for the shopper to pick up at checkout.\u00a0\nAmazon has continued to step up its grocery game in 2024, including rapidly growing its Amazon Fresh footprint, debuting a new private brand and launching two new grocery subscription plans just months apart.\n"

        "Author": "  GuruFocus News ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-10-14, Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $93.88. It's currently trading at a price of $188.82. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -101.13%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$4.26\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.1%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n25.08\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n10.66\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n93.88\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $57.90. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -226.11%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "Teamsters Call on Amazon to Negotiate a Contract, Stop Union Busting\u00a0 \nQUEENS,\u00a0N.Y., Oct. 16, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- This morning, Amazon Teamsters, their allies, and elected officials held a rally outside of the Amazon DBK4 warehouse in Queens to demand that Amazon recognize the workers' union and come to the table to negotiate a Teamsters contract.\n\"We are organizing for better pay, job security, and a better health care plan for all of us,\" said Lamont Hopewell, an Amazon Teamster. \"The vast majority of drivers have come together to demand Amazon recognize our Teamsters Union. Amazon needs to respect us and come to the table to negotiate a contract immediately.\"\n\"Instead of giving us the respect and dignity we are asking for, Amazon is engaging in illegal union busting,\" said Tyrick Pollard, an Amazon Teamster. \"This has to stop. Our union is only getting stronger, and we will keep fighting until we win.\"\nTeamsters also expressed their frustration with Amazon's company culture and how it has impacted their lives.\n\"Amazon does not respect me as a driver. The job is really taking a toll on my body,\" said Christian Santana. \"Right now, it's a dead end, but as Amazon Teamsters we will make this job a career.\"\nSince the DBK4 drivers joined the Teamsters on Sept. 16, Amazon has refused to acknowledge their efforts and blown past the deadline for union recognition. The union is filing unfair labor practice charges against Amazon for their blatant federal labor law violations, including retaliating against workers and attempting to bust the workers' union.\nJoining the Teamsters were numerous elected officials from the federal, state, and local level, who rallied to show their support for the workers' efforts and call out Amazon for their egregious union-busting practices.\n\"Working men and women have the right to organize and advocate for better working conditions, and that includes the Amazon drivers who I am proud to stand in solidarity with today,\" said Congresswoman Grace\u00a0Meng (D-NY). \"My message to Amazon is simple: recognize this union and negotiate in good faith. Anything less is unacceptable. We must always have the backs of working people, and I will continue to do so. They work tirelessly for our communities and are the backbone of New York and the nation.\"\n\"The labor movement is strong in Queens,\" said State Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris (D-Queens). \"It's so important we stand with our Amazon workers in Maspeth, who are joining with the Teamsters, to demand Amazon give them the respect they deserve.\"\n\"Amazon has broken the law time and time again, disrespecting their workers in the process. We are doing everything we can in Albany to level the playing field, but at this moment we need this employer to honor their employees' rights,\" said State Senator Jessica Ramos (D-Queens). \"This is about dignity, this is about safety, this is about rebuilding this city's middle class. It's time for Amazon to recognize this union, stop the union busting, and head to the bargaining table.\"\n\"Amazon drivers are the backbone of the company's success and an integral part of the workforce,\" said State Senator John Liu (D-Queens). \"Like all workers, they deserve fair wages, safe working conditions, and respect from their employer, and we call on Amazon to immediately stop the union busting, recognize their union, and negotiate a fair contract so these essential workers can get their fair share.\"\n\"Amazon DBK4 drivers made history by forming a union with the Teamsters,\" said State Assembly Member Zoran Mandani (D-Queens). \"Now the world's largest corporation needs to stop its illegal practices, recognize the union and settle a contract with fair pay, safe working conditions, and respect on the job.\"\n\"I stand in solidarity with Teamsters as they fight to demand a contract with fair pay and safety as they work. No more union busting and corporate greed. Amazon must come to the table immediately to recognize their union and bargain in good faith. We have taken on Amazon in Queens before, and we will do so again,\" said State Assembly Member Jessica Gonz\u00e1lez-Rojas (D-Queens).\n\"There is no room for union busting here in Queens. It's unacceptable and Amazon needs to know we're watching,\" said State Assembly Member Steven Raga (D-Queens), \"I stand with Teamsters here in Queens and across the nation calling on Amazon to come to the table to negotiate improved wages, working conditions, and safety standards for their workers.\"\n\"I stand in solidarity with the drivers from Queens as they demand recognition of their union and fair treatment from Amazon. These workers have tirelessly advocated for better wages, safe working conditions, and a voice in their workplace. It's time for Amazon to meet these workers at the negotiating table and honor their rights,\" said State Assembly Member Nily Rozic (D-Queens).\n\"I am proud to stand with the Teamsters and Joint Council 16 to support the Amazon drivers' fight for fairness, respect, and dignity in the workplace,\" said New York City Councilmember Sandra Ung (D-Queens). \"That means fair pay, benefits, and workplace protections. It means having a voice on the job and to be treated with dignity and respect. Amazon's success is built on the hard work of their drivers, and it is past time the company recognize the legitimacy of their efforts to organize. I call on Amazon to do the right thing and immediately recognize these workers' right to unionize and begin negotiations in good faith.\"\nAmazon Teamsters are united in Queens, with hundreds more DBK4 workers joining the union in just the last month. They stand in support of Amazon drivers and warehouse workers nationwide who are also organizing with the Teamsters.\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

        "Title": "Amazon hit with US labor board complaint over 'joint employment' of drivers",
        "Author": "  Daniel Wiessner ",
        "Text": "By Daniel Wiessner\n(Reuters) -Amazon.com has been accused by a U.S. labor board of illegally refusing to bargain with a union representing drivers employed by a contractor, the agency announced on Wednesday.\nThe complaint from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claims that Amazon is a so-called \"joint employer\" of drivers employed by the contractor, Battle Tested Strategies (BTS), and used a series of illegal tactics to discourage union activities at a facility in Palmdale, California.\nBTS drivers voted to join the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union last year, becoming the first Amazon delivery contractors to unionize.\nThe NLRB in a complaint issued on Monday said Amazon broke the law by terminating its contract with BTS after the drivers unionized, without first bargaining with the Teamsters.\nThe board had said in August that it had found merit to the union's claims that Amazon exerts control over BTS drivers and should be considered their employer under federal labor law. The NLRB at the time said it would issue a complaint unless Amazon settled the case.\nThe board said last month it planned to issue a second complaint involving a different group of Amazon drivers.\nIn a statement, Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards said the NLRB did not include many of the Teamsters' claims in its complaint, showing that the union was \"misrepresenting the facts.\"\n\"As we\u2019ve said all along, there is no merit to any of their claims. We look forward to showing that as the legal process continues and expect the few remaining allegations will be dismissed as well,\" Hards said.\nAmazon has said in the past that it does not have enough control over drivers' working conditions to be considered their joint employer.\nTeamsters President Sean O'Brien said in a statement that Amazon is trying to reap the benefits of drivers' labor without taking responsibility for their well being.\n\u201cThis decision brings us one step closer to getting Amazon workers the pay, working conditions, and contracts they deserve,\" O'Brien said.\nJoint employment has been one of the most contentious U.S. labor issues over the last decade, and the NLRB's standard for determining when companies qualify as joint employers has shifted numerous times since the Obama administration.\nBusiness groups favor a test that requires direct and immediate control over workers, while unions and Democrats back a standard that covers indirect forms of control.\nThe case will be heard by an administrative judge in Los Angeles, who is scheduled to hold an initial hearing next March. The judge's decision can be reviewed by the five-member NLRB, whose rulings can be appealed to federal court.\nA ruling that Amazon is a joint employer under federal labor law could be applied in cases involving other Amazon contractors and force the company to bargain with drivers' unions.\nThe board, meanwhile, is facing claims by a growing number of companies, including Amazon, that its structure and in-house enforcement proceedings violate the U.S. Constitution.\nAmazon has filed a lawsuit against the board seeking to block it from deciding whether the company must bargain with a union representing workers at a New York City warehouse. A federal appeals court on Monday temporarily blocked the NLRB from ruling while it reviews Amazon's claims.\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Alexandra Hudson, Mark Porter and Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n"

        "Author": "  Fatima Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other best gig economy stocks.\nThe pandemic era has been heralded as one of the most profitable periods for gig economy stocks, as more and more people started picking up remote work opportunities through online platforms looking to connect service providers with clients. But even before then, the gig economy has been a vital part of the market since, at any point in time, there will be a massive cohort of people who simply want to be their own boss \u2013 the pandemic just made it easier for these types of people to shine brighter.\nPost-pandemic, as people began to realize that it was, in fact, possible to work from home, gig economy companies were able to hold on to their profits. Even after the return to offices, many individuals have decided to stick with remote work opportunities provided to them by well known online platforms. According to Michael Morton, Senior Analyst at MoffettNathanson, a major part of the reason why gig economy stocks have been performing well in the market this year is that investor perceptions about these businesses are changing. Previously, investors were less inclined to go for gig economy companies because they used to focus too much on growth and not enough on profitability. However, Morton believes that companies are changing this approach to make it the opposite now \u2013 the focus on profitability is now overruling that on growth.\nMorton believes that well-known gig economy businesses in the ride-hailing and food delivery spaces are promising enterprises that are set to benefit from secular tailwinds. The biggest tailwind for such businesses is their expansion into large, untapped, addressable markets. While there will be a degree of risk attached to these new endeavors as the big gig economy players start to pursue these opportunities aggressively with high levels of investment, there is room to argue that these investments will be for the overall benefit of the businesses that do tap into markets that have gone ignored so far \u2013 think Southeast Asia, India, Latin America, and Africa.\nAnother risk that some people see for gig economy businesses is in the regulatory domain. Morton believes that the services these companies are providing to consumers are important enough to necessitate a cooperative attitude from regulatory bodies across the globe, seeing as they not only offer what are now considered essential services but also provide a means of generating supplemental income for their workers. At the same time, most of your bigger gig economy players with operations in up to 70 countries have also shown the capability of working with a variety of regulatory landscapes.\nThese factors have been working wonders in terms of alleviating investor concerns surrounding gig economy stocks, a development that is leading to more investors being convinced to buy into these businesses. As a result, the popularity of these stocks is only going up, which is why we\u2019ve compiled a list of some of the best gig economy stocks to buy now.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nWe sifted through ETFs and online rankings to compile an initial list of 20 gig economy stocks. We then selected the 10 gig economy stocks with the highest number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, as of Q2 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a big-tech e-commerce player. It entered the gig economy with the launch of Amazon Flex, an app that allows users to use their own vehicles to deliver Amazon packages to earn extra cash.\nBy investing in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), investors don\u2019t just get to benefit from a classic gig economy player\u2019s profitability since this company has a lot more going on. Its e-commerce business is among the biggest in the world and is the major driver of company revenues. In the second quarter, company revenue rose 10% year-over-year to $148 billion, and the biggest contributor to this was e-commerce sales.\nThe e-commerce business is really the heart of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a company. Through this segment, the company not only benefits itself, but also uplifts merchants selling on its platform \u2013 which in turn drives up profits for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the end. The second quarter also saw the e-commerce segment\u2019s operating margin jump by 58% year-over-year to $5.1 billion, for instance. Most of the profits here come from online sales, but a huge chunk also comes from the fees charged to sellers on the Amazon platform.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also well known for its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, which only makes it an even more lucrative player in the market for those looking to buy gig economy stocks that might be able to offer some extra profit generated from other lucrative business segments.\nHolding a total stake value of $65.8 billion in the stock, 308 hedge funds were long Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the second quarter.\nOverall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of 10 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Buy.\u00a0While AMZN is an exceptional investment, we believe that AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN and which trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

The main event with this card is the high rewards rate on those categories of purchases. If you\u2019re already forking over for the annual Prime membership fee, you might as well earn top-notch rewards on your spending with the brand.\nThe Prime card is basically a store card, but Amazon isn\u2019t just any old store. The uber-retailer is known for being able to deliver almost anything from alarm clocks to zucchini, and get it to you within a day or two in most urban and suburban areas. Prime membership grants you the speediest of deliveries without any additional costs, along with some other valuable benefits and services. Whether or not Prime membership is right for you is for you to decide. But you need it to apply for the Prime Visa, and the card is the only one that earns an unlimited 5% back at Amazon, Whole Foods and Chase Travel.\nThe Prime Visa\u2019s earnings in other categories are fine, but if you\u2019re doing most of your spending on groceries that aren\u2019t at Whole Foods or shelling out a bundle for gas, dining and transit you\u2019d be better off getting a card that earns high reward on spending in those areas. There\u2019s a plain-Jane Amazon Visa too that doesn\u2019t require a Prime membership. But the rewards are watered-down to 3% back on Amazon spending, Whole Foods and Chase Travel purchases. If you spend a decent amount of money choosing to \u201cAmazon it\u201d, the Prime Card (and Prime membership) will likely both streamline your shopping and save you money in the form of rewards.\nIf your doorstep is greeted with cardboard boxes on the daily, or if you fill most of your shopping needs with a few clicks, the Prime Visa is a worthwhile option to score high rewards on shopping with Amazon that can translate into cash back in your pocket.\nIf you rarely shop with Amazon, you\u2019re better off with a card that earns high rewards in the areas where you spend the most. Even if you spend a lot on Whole Foods shopping without any Amazon orders, you\u2019re still likely to find greater value in a card that earns high rewards on grocery shopping in general, freeing you up to shop at other food stores.\nThe card that wins my 2024 No Brainer Award is the Prime Visa. It\u2019s free, you\u2019ll get a $100 Amazon Gift Card instantly upon approval and it offers 5% cash back on Amazon purchases (6% if you choose slower shipping at checkout). Given the glut of stuff I buy off Amazon (ranging from the silly to the essential), I\u2019ve already earned $250+ cash back this year. Chris Butsch, Fortune contributor\nThe Prime Visa earns rewards at the following rates:\n5% back on Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and Chase Travel\u2120 purchases with an eligible Prime membership.\n2% back at gas stations, restaurants, and local transit and commuting, including rideshare.\n1% back on all other purchases\nNew cardholders are eligible to receive a $150 Amazon Gift Card instantly upon approval exclusively for Prime members, which will be loaded into their Amazon.com account. An welcome bonus you can use that day is an unusual feature.\nThe points earned on the Prime Visa are worth a penny per point for a variety of options, so redeeming 10,000 points would be worth $100. Here\u2019s what you can do with your earnings.\nYou can redeem your points earned from previous purchases on the card toward future purchases on Amazon.com. A point is worth a penny this way and there\u2019s no minimum redemption amount. Although this is likely the way many people will choose to use their points due to the ease of use, it\u2019s worth pointing out that a more valuable use is to apply your rewards as a statement credit to your card balance so you earn points on every purchase. When you use your points to pay for an Amazon purchase, you won\u2019t earn any points on that purchase.\nYou can also buy gift cards through Amazon for a wide variety of merchants using your points.\nAs mentioned above, this is likely the best use of your rewards earned on the card. A point is worth a penny when redeemed this way and you can pay yourself back for your Amazon purchase while still earning points for the buy. You aren\u2019t limited to just redeeming rewards for an Amazon purchase, you can choose to redeem your rewards from the card at any time and in any amount as a statement credit.\nIf you\u2019d prefer to have the money in hand, you can have your rewards deposited into an eligible U.S. checking or savings account. You either make this redemption online through your account or by calling the number on the back of your card.\nYou can redeem your rewards to book travel through Chase Travel. This includes flights, hotels, cruises, and rental cars . A point is also worth a penny when redeemed this way. Although these rewards can be redeemed for travel through Chase, they are not the same as Chase Ultimate Rewards and cannot be combined with the earnings from other Chase cards. Additionally, you cannot transfer Amazon points to any of Chase\u2019s travel loyalty partners.\nAuto rental col\u00adli\u00adsion damage waiver: Receive secondary rental coverage on most cars when you decline the rental company\u2019s collision insurance and charge the entire rental cost to your card.\nBaggage delay insurance: If your baggage is delayed by more than six hours, you can get reimbursed for essential purchases up to $100 a day for up to three days.\nExtended warranty protection: Extends the time period of the U.S. manufacturer\u2019s warranty by an additional year, on eligible warranties of three years or less.\nLost luggage reimbursement: You\u2019re covered up to $3,000 per passenger If you or an immediate family member check or carry on luggage that is damaged or lost by the carrier.\nPur\u00adchase pro\u00adtec\u00adtion: New purchases are covered for 120 days against damage or theft up to $500 per claim.\nTravel accident insurance: You are eligible for accidental death or dismemberment coverage of up to $500,000 when you pay for your air, bus, train, or cruise transportation with your card.\nMaybe you don\u2019t shop with Amazon enough to justify the annual Prime membership fee or you simply don\u2019t want to be forced to pay a fee to unlock the benefits of the Prime Card. There are other options to consider that can still earn strong rewards with the online retailer.\nPrime Visa\nAmazon Rewards Visa Signature Card\nU.S. Bank Shopper Cash Rewards\u2122 Visa Signature\u00ae Card\nAnnual fee\nAnnual fee\nAnnual fee\n$0 annual fee, requires Prime membership to apply\n$0\n$0 intro annual fee for the first year ($95 year thereafter)\nWelcome bonus\nWelcome bonus\nWelcome bonus\n$150 Amazon Gift Card instantly upon approval exclusively for Prime members\n$50 Amazon.com gift card\n$250 bonus after you spend $2,000 in eligible purchases within the first 120 days of account opening.\nRewards\nRewards\nRewards\n5% back on Amazon.com, Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and Chase Travel\u2120 purchases with an eligible Prime membership2% back at gas stations, restaurants, and local transit and commuting, including rideshare1% back on all other purchases\n3% cash back on Amazon.com and Whole Foods purchases2% cash back on gas station, restaurant, and drugstore purchases1% cash back on general purchases\n6% cash back on your first $1,500 in combined eligible purchases each quarter with two retailers you choose3% cash back on your first $1,500 in eligible purchases on your choice of one everyday category (like wholesale clubs, gas and EV charging stations, bills and utilities)1.5% cash back on all other eligible purchases\nOur Take\nOur Take\nOur Take\nThe Prime Visa is an ideal cash-back card for those who know their delivery driver on a first-name basis. With an industry-leading 5% cash back on Amazon and Whole Foods purchases it\u2019s a no-brainer as long as you\u2019re already paying for a Prime Membership.\nThe Amazon Visa only makes sense if you spend heavily at Amazon and Whole Foods but are firmly against buying Prime membership.\nThe US Bank requires effort to maximize, but if you're willing to play the game you could end up a winner.\nLearn moreat Cardratings.com\nThe Amazon Visa could satisfy those who shop occasionally at Amazon.com but can\u2019t stomach the idea of paying the Prime membership fee. The card has no annual fee, no membership requirement and earns 3% back on Amazon and Chase Travel purchases compared to the Prime Card\u2019s 5% in those areas. The Amazon Visa earns the same rate as the Prime Visa of 2% back at gas stations, restaurants, and local transit and commuting and 1% on all other spending. All of the other card perks, benefits and redemption options are identical.\nYou\u2019d have to spend $2,780 a year in one or more of the Prime Card\u2019s 5% categories to break even with the cost of the $139 annual Prime membership. That should help you determine if the Amazon Visa or the Prime Visa is a better fit for your spending habits.\nIf you\u2019re willing to put in a little work, the U.S. Bank Shopper Cash Rewards Card could work out to be even more lucrative on your Amazon spending than an Amazon cobranded credit card. For an annual fee of $0 in the first year, $95 after that, the card earns up to 6% on your first $1,500 spent quarterly with two participating retailers of your choice, 5.5% on prepaid hotel reservations and car rentals made through the U.S. Bank Travel Rewards Center, 3% cash back on the first $1,500 you spend each quarter in an eligible category you choose, and 1.5% back on everything else.\nThere\u2019s a long list of categories eligible to choose from for the 6% rewards but let\u2019s assume you want it to always be Amazon. That means over the course of a year, you can earn 6% back up on a total of $6,000 in spending at Amazon or $360 in Amazon spending compared to earning $300 on $6,000 in spending at 5% from the Prime Card. But most people\u2019s spending habits are not split into neat quarterly chunks and tracking the multiple rates and spending caps on the U.S. Shopper Cash Rewards card is best left for those who enjoy tracking the minutiae of how to maximize every dollar spent.\nChoosing between these two cards will depend on which one more closely aligns with your spending habits, including how you spend in areas that aren\u2019t Amazon along with your willingness to pay attention to category caps.\nEvery day can feel like Prime Day with the Prime Visa. If Amazon spending is a prominent part of your budget and you already have a Prime membership, adding this card into the mix is a smart move to earn high rewards.\nIf a Prime membership is unappealing to you, or you only shop a few times a year with Amazon, look to a card that offers benefits and rewards that you\u2019ll get more value from.\nIs Amazon Prime free with the Prime card?\nNo, the Prime Visa card does not include a free Amazon Prime membership. Amazon Prime membership is currently $14.99 a month or $139 annually\nIs the Prime card a credit card?\nYes, Amazon\u2019s Prime card is a Visa Signature card which means you can use it anywhere Visa is accepted.\nHow can I redeem rewards with the Prime card?\nYou can redeem rewards at checkout for Amazon purchases, for a statement credit for your Prime card, for gift cards, or to book travel through Chase.\nWhat credit score do I need to get approved for the Prime Card?\nLike most rewards cards, you\u2019ll need good or better credit to be a likely candidate for approval for the Prime card. However, most issuers take a number of factors into consideration in addition to your credit score, including your income and other debt obligations.\nFortune Recommends\u2122 has partnered with CardRatings for our coverage of credit card products. Fortune Recommends\u2122 and CardRatings may receive a commission from card issuers.\nPlease note that card details are accurate as of the publish date, but are subject to change at any time at the discretion of the issuer.

The reactors are smaller and easier to build than traditional large nuclear power plants, which the International Atomic Energy Agency says can be built in a wider variety of places.\nThe investments include projects in Washington state and Virginia, with both state-run and private utility companies like Dominion Energy (D) and Energy Northwest, and an investment into a company developing new nuclear technology. The energy created will be used to power Amazon facilities and surrounding communities.\nDominion projects that power demand in Virginia is growing by 5% per year, and expects it to double over the next 15 years.\nAmazon also said it is investing in X-Energy, which is developing new technology for \"next generation\" SMRs, as part of a $500 million funding round that also includes the University of Michigan, Ares Management and Ken Griffin\u2014CEO of the Citadel hedge fund.\nAlphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Microsoft (MSFT) have also announced nuclear power investments over the last month, as the tech giants search for clean energy sources as electricity demand is projected to continue rising to power data centers and AI technology.\nRead the original article on Investopedia.\n"

        "Text": "On Monday, Truist analyst Youssef Squali reiterated his buy rating on tech juggernaut Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), raising his price target from $230 to $265. That target implies 43% price appreciation over the next 12 months.\nBased on Truist card data tied to Amazon's U.S. revenue, Squali thinks the company is on track to meet or exceed sales guidance for the third quarter. With analysts expecting 10% revenue growth in the upcoming quarter, Amazon's ability to maintain double-digit sales growth would be reassuring following a handful of quarters with single-digit growth over the last few years.\nNoting a more resilient consumer, growing ad revenue, faster growth at Amazon Web Services, and improved operating margins, Squali reiterated his bullishness, explaining, \"This (occurs) even as the company invests aggressively in AI, Amazon Web Services (AWS), logistics, and Project Kuiper.\"\nTrading at just 18 times cash from operations (CFO), Amazon's valuation is at its lowest level since 2010 and is well below its 10-year average of 28. To put this price-to-CFO ratio in perspective, if Amazon quit investing in its vast array of growth options (AI, AWS, ads, Kuiper, logistics, Prime Video, international, etc.), it would be capable of generating immense amounts of free cash flow (FCF).\nQuite frankly, though, it doesn't want to do that -- and investors shouldn't want it to. With one of the most incredible track records on the market regarding the company's growth optionality with new businesses, like AWS, online ads, and its own logistical network, Amazon's greatest strength is continuously deploying capital effectively.\nAmazon's relatively cheap valuation, paired with a high-and-rising 18% CFO margin while the company is investing aggressively in its growth options, has me in agreement with Squali's optimism.\nThe icing on the cake for investors?\nAWS holds a leading 31% market share of the booming cloud infrastructure industry, which experts expect to double in size by 2028. Since AWS brings in more than half of Amazon's operating income, the company's funding for its promising growth optionality should face no shortage of cash anytime soon.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 20 Trending AI News And Analyst Ratings.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) startups have taken the finance world by storm in the past few months. This interest was sparked by the blockbuster launch of ChatGPT by California-based OpenAI in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has raised tens of billions of dollars in new funding and reached a valuation of over $150 billion. OpenAI revealed earlier this week that it had secured more than $6.6 billion in new funding through a financing round led by prominent names including Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, and Tiger Global, among others.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nPerhaps one reason the startup is so popular is that it is projecting more than $3.5 billion in revenue this year and over $11 billion in 2025. AI startups in general have been quicker at making revenues than previous technology booms, according to an analysis of payment information by fintech firm Stripe. The report underlines that top AI groups are reaching millions of dollars in sales within a year. This timeline is far faster in the life cycle of a startup than comparable non-AI tech groups. The report relies on annual revenue data for the 100 highest-grossing privately held AI companies using Stripe, compared with a comparable basket of prominent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) start-ups as of July 2018.\nThe report has gained a lot of traction since Stripe customers include OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, GitHub and Midjourney, among others. Stripe claims, per Financial Times, that AI start-ups took a median 11 months to hit $1 million in annual revenue after their first sales on Stripe, compared with 15 months for the previous generation of SaaS companies. AI start-ups that have scaled to more than $30 million in annual revenue achieved the milestone in 20 months \u2014 five times faster than past SaaS companies. Emily Sands, the head of information at Stripe, highlights that unlike past generations of software companies, AI companies paid compute costs straight out of the gate, and were under pressure to build monetisation faster.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Truist analyst Youssef Squali recently released a research note on the firm, reiterating a Buy rating on the stock and raising the price target to $265 from $230. In the note, the analyst underlined that North America revenue for the tech giant was tracking to consensus estimates, reflecting a resilient consumer, sustained growth in advertising revenue, faster growth at Web Services and higher operating margins year-over-year. Per the analyst, this came even as the company invested aggressively in artificial intelligence, AWS, logistics and Project Kuiper.\nThe note further highlighted that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) remained a favorite mega cap at Truist as the company continued to gain share of global e-commerce and improved its value proposition to both merchants and consumers. It was also one of the best ways to play cloud, AI, digital ads and global logistics, contended the advisory, which moved the price target to fiscal 2025 from 2024.\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the trending AI stocks now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  HALELUYA HADERO ",
        "Text": "A federal judge said the Federal Trade Commission can proceed with its landmark antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. But, he also gave the company a small victory by tossing out a few claims made by states involved in the legal fight.\nThe order, issued last week by Judge John H. Chun and unsealed on Monday, is a major defeat for Amazon, which has tried for months to get the case tossed out in court. A trial in the case is slated to be held in October 2026.\n\u201cWe are pleased with the court\u2019s decision and look forward to moving this case forward,\u201d FTC spokesperson Doug Farrar said in a prepared statement. \u201cThe ways Amazon illegally maintains its monopolies and the harm they cause\u2014including suppressed competition and higher prices for shoppers and sellers\u2014will be on full display at trial.\u201d\nThe FTC and the attorneys general of 18 states, plus Puerto Rico, have alleged in court the e-commerce behemoth is abusing its position in the marketplace to inflate prices on and off its platform, overcharge sellers and stifle competition that pops up on the market.\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in September 2023, is the result of a yearslong investigation into the company\u2019s business and is one of the most significant legal challenges brought against Amazon in its nearly 30-year history.\nU.S. regulators and state attorneys general are accusing the online retailer of violating federal and state antitrust and consumer protection laws.\nIn the order, Judge Chun, of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, allowed the federal challenges and many of the state claims to proceed. But he dismissed some claims made by New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma and Maryland under state antitrust or consumer protection laws.\nAmazon, for its part, expressed confidence that it could prove its argument in court as the case proceeds\n\u201cThe ruling at this early stage requires the court to assume all facts alleged in the complaint are true. They are not,\u201d Tim Doyle said in a statement, adding that the agency\u2019s case \u201cfalsely\u201d claims consumers only consider popular sites Walmart.com, Target.com, Amazon, and eBay when shopping for household products.\n\u201cMoving forward the FTC will have to prove its claims in court, and we\u2019re confident those claims will not hold up when the FTC has to prove them with evidence,\u201d Doyle said. He also asserted the FTC\u2019s approach \u201cwould make shopping more difficult and costly.\u201d\nThe FTC is also suing Meta Platforms over alleged monopolistic practices, while the Department of Justice has brought similar lawsuits against Apple and Google, with some success.\nIn August, a federal judge ruled that Google\u2019s ubiquitous search engine is illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.\n"

Here\u2019s why\nWhat kind of music makes you most productive at work? Here\u2019s what the science says\nBut now there\u2019s more bad news for Prime Video viewers: Amazon plans to ramp up the number of ads a viewer sees in 2025. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nThe news that Amazon plans on pushing more ads to viewers starting next year comes from the Financial Times, which reported on comments by Kelly Day, Amazon\u2019s vice president of Prime Video International.\nDay told the FT that Prime Video\u2019s advertising load would \u201cramp up a little bit more into 2025.\u201d\nThe move toward more ads next year comes after Amazon introduced ads before programs, but not in the middle of them. Though Day did not specify whether the increased ad load would mean ads will now play during a show, many of Amazon\u2019s streaming competitors already display ads in this way.\nReached for comment about the plan, Amazon indicated that it will still not be as ad heavy as its competitors. \u201cWe have not changed our plans to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers, and evaluate advertising volumes to help ensure we\u2019re delivering a great customer experience,\u201d a spokesperson told Fast Company.\nDay said Amazon\u2019s choice of not including ads in the middle of shows was \u201ca bit of a contrarian approach to take to things from us. But . . . it\u2019s actually gone much better than we even anticipated\u201d and noted that the method had been a \u201cgentle entry into advertising that has exceeded customers expectations in terms of what the ad experience would be like.\u201d\nShe also noted that churn since the addition of ads had \u201cbeen much, much less than we anticipated.\u201d\n\u201cChurn\u201d is a term that refers to people canceling their subscriptions, which is often a reflection of dissatisfaction with a streaming service\u2014whether that stems from too many ads or not enough compelling content to keep the viewer subscribed month after month.\nMoney. Amazon is doing this for money. Despite nearly every tech giant and legacy media company diving head first into streaming from about 2019 onwards, most have now found that streaming services are deeply unprofitable\u2014or will take longer to realize profits than expected.\nThis is because subscribers are constantly seeking out new original content, even though said content is expensive to produce. The fees from subscriptions alone are not enough to produce the content while paying for all the other costs of keeping the streaming service running\u2014not to mention having anything left over for profits.\nSo streaming services have increasingly turned to ads as a way to generate extra revenue. Amazon now wants more ads to increase that revenue.\nAmazon says it has a global audience for its Prime Video service of about 200 million people, with more than half of those viewers in the United States. Such a large number of users could be a powerful draw for advertisers\u2014at least, that\u2019s what Amazon hopes as it gets ready to roll out even more ads to Prime Video.\nAnd these won\u2019t be just your ordinary noninteractive spots. The FT says Amazon will unveil interactive \u201cshoppable\u201d ads for Prime Video, which will allow viewers to add an advertised product to their Amazon shopping cart without having to leave the show they are watching.\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.comSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http://fastcompany.com/newsletters\n"

        "Text": "Investing.com -- Shares in nuclear companies rose higher on Wednesday after Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced that it has entered into three agreements to develop small modular reactors (SMRs), a type of nuclear power technology, as part of its strategy to address the growing energy needs of its data centers.\nThe move positions Amazon alongside other major tech companies seeking alternative energy sources to meet rising electricity demand.\nShares in Nano Nuclear Energy Inc (NASDAQ:NNE) and Nuscale Power Corp (NYSE:SMR) surged nearly 10% each in premarket trading, and Oklo Inc (NYSE:OKLO) jumped more than 11%.\nAmazon said it plans to fund a feasibility study for an SMR project near an Energy Northwest site in Washington state. The SMR, which will be developed by X-Energy, did not have financial details disclosed.\nAs part of the agreement, Amazon will have the option to purchase electricity from four reactor modules.\nEnergy Northwest, a coalition of state public utilities, can expand the project by adding up to eight more 80 MW modules, potentially reaching a total capacity of 960 MW\u2014enough to power over 770,000 U.S. homes. This additional capacity would serve Amazon's needs as well as power homes and businesses in the area.\n\u201cOne of the fastest ways to address climate change is by transitioning our society to carbon-free energy sources, and nuclear energy is both carbon-free and able to scale\u2014which is why it\u2019s an important area of investment for Amazon,\u201d said Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services.\n\"Our agreements will encourage the construction of new nuclear technologies that will generate energy for decades to come.\u201d\nSMRs are designed to have components assembled in factories, which helps lower construction costs compared to today's larger reactors that are built on-site. However, critics argue that SMRs may still be too expensive to achieve the necessary economies of scale.\nNuclear power, which is known for generating electricity without greenhouse gas emissions and providing well-paid union jobs, has support across both political parties in the U.S.\nRelated Articles\nNuclear stocks rally on Amazon's pacts to support the sector development\nShareholders approve buyout of AirAsia by long-haul associate\nASML's early earnings publication a 'human mistake', shareholder group says\n"

        "Text": "US e-commerce giant Amazon is set to deploy a new AI-powered solution, Vision-Assisted Package Retrieval (VAPR), on 1,000 electric delivery vans by early 2025.\nThe technology is designed to assist drivers in locating the correct packages for delivery quickly and efficiently, using a system of visual and audio cues.\nVAPR will be integrated into Amazon's electric delivery vans produced by Rivian, aiming to save drivers time and effort.\nThe concept of VAPR originated at the beginning of 2020, when the retailer\u2019s transportation team envisioned using technology to aid drivers seamlessly.\nAfter several years of development and driver feedback, the tech is now ready for a wider rollout.\nAmazon transportation product manager John Colucci said: \"We had to think about factors that are unique to the delivery experience, such as lighting and space constraints inside vans.\u201d\nOnce a delivery van arrives at the delivery location, VAPR will project a green \"O\" on all packages for that stop and a red \"X\" on the rest.\nThis system allows drivers to quickly identify the correct packages without searching through labels or using mobile devices.\nBloomfield Logistics driver Bobby Garcia, who has been testing VAPR in the North Boston area, said: \"Before, it could take me anywhere between two and five minutes to empty a tote and organise packages for the next stops. Now, with VAPR, this whole step just takes me about a minute.\u201d\nVAPR employs a computer vision technology, Amazon Robotics Identification, or AR-ID, created for fulfilment centres, to automatically recognise items during inventory stowing or picking. This system eliminates the requirement for manual barcode scanning.\nBy analysing its environment, it can detect and interpret several barcodes simultaneously in real time.\nVAPR's development involved training machine learning models to recognise labels and packages under different lighting and packaging conditions.\nThe technology has been optimised for use within a van environment and is paired with automotive light projectors and cameras, all linked to the van's delivery route navigation system.\nVAPR utilises several Amazon Web Services technologies, including the machine learning platform SageMaker and IoT Greengrass.\nIn September 2024, Amazon announced an additional investment of $2.1bn into its delivery service partner (DSP) programme.\n\"Amazon to deploy AI package retrieval tech on 1,000 electric vans \" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks.\nInvestors have been looking for smart ways to play the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has swept the global financial markets over the past two years. Most of the attention in this regard has been confined to obvious choices in semiconductors, software, and biotechnology. Even within these sectors, prominent companies and their AI initiatives have dominated headlines. However, there are several hidden gems within these sectors that offer the same bang for the buck, given present macro context, but are not in limelight as such. For example, Bernie Ahkong, an analyst at UBS, recently noted that the first phase of AI was interest towards chipmakers. In the second phase, investors moved towards the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centers. The present tilt towards utility and power firms is quite possibly the third phase of this AI focus.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nA recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "Text": "We recently published an article titled, Jim Cramer on Netflix and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other stocks discussed by Jim Cramer.\nRecently, Mad Money\u2019s host, Jim Cramer addressed what he called a \u201cridiculous plethora of sell-side downgrades,\u201d noting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.94%, the S&P 500 decreased by 0.96%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 1.18% on Monday. While he acknowledged the session\u2019s poor performance, he cautioned that paying too much attention to downgrades can be detrimental for long-term investors.\nCramer urged investors not to get overly influenced by the negative sentiment on Wall Street and emphasized the importance of staying committed to strong companies, even when their stock prices experience volatility. He recounted the history of the bull market, stating:\n\u201cWhen I look at the history of this incredible bull market, and it has been an incredible bull market, it\u2019s littered with buy-to-hold, hold-to-sell, buy-to-hold, hold-to-sell. These downgrades scare you out of amazing stocks at levels that may temporarily be too high, but will recover later. If you listen to the downgrades, though, you\u2019ll never recover with it.\u201d\nIn discussing the challenges investors face, Cramer pointed out that many get rattled by analyst downgrades and might sell their shares in solid companies, which can make it difficult to buy back in later.\n\u201cIn the last decade, the toughest thing to do is to hold on to good stocks. But analysts and commentators love to take aim at big long-term winners. Their jeremiads have scared so many people out of some amazing gains.\u201d\nHe observed that complacency can be prevalent on Wall Street, with bullish investors often overlooking risks while bearish ones miss out on potential opportunities. For those considering action based on a downgrade, Cramer advised waiting for a bounce to sell, but he noted that timing such moves is \u201cincredibly hard,\u201d even for seasoned traders.\nCramer emphasized that when analysts downgrade stocks that have already taken a hit and overlook positive aspects, it can create a challenging environment. However, he believes it is still possible to profit. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\u201cI need you to understand that when analysts downgrade after stocks have already been hammered, when really good investors ignore the positives, then, it may be a grim time. But not so grim that we can\u2019t make money by focusing on the fundamentals of the companies. And not just the economy, the Fed, interest rates and oil.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 15 stocks that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episodes of Mad Money on October 7 and October 8. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nCramer Says Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Always Comes Back\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global powerhouse in the retail industry, offering a wide array of consumer products through both online and physical platforms. Recently, Jim Cramer discussed Wells Fargo\u2019s downgrade of Amazon. He noted the stock\u2019s drop from $184 to $161 but its recent rise to $186. He said:\n\u201cFirst downgrade, Amazon by Wells Fargo titled \u201cPositive Revision Story on Pause Reducing to Equal Weight\u201d. Totally get it, lots of headwinds, stock\u2019s abused from the so-called bad quarter when Amazon fell from $184 to $161. Since then, it\u2019s traded as high as $195, but it\u2019s $186 as of last week. It\u2019s time to sell? I\u2019m not so sure.\nCramer emphasized that the company has historically faced challenges and always rebounded. He suggested that while the stock may dip, he believes it will recover again. He added:\n\u201cI remember a year and a half ago when I was screaming at them because Amazon Web Services was underperforming. Came right back. Last time they reported, I was in disbelief at the Olympics and the attempted assassination of Donald Trump led to a light third-quarter sales guide. I was apoplectic at the Alexa losses and what happens? Comes right back.\nWhile Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) generates a significant portion of its revenue from its retail operations, it finds a substantial share of its profits through Amazon Web Services (AWS), which stands as one of the largest cloud infrastructure providers worldwide. This segment operates with considerably higher margins compared to retail.\nThe ability to provide discounts, free shipping, and affordable hardware options for Prime members has been pivotal in Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) growth strategy. With over 200 million Prime subscribers globally, the company has cultivated a loyal customer base. As of the second quarter of 2024, AWS commanded a significant 33% share of the cloud infrastructure market.\nIt reported mixed outcomes in its second-quarter earnings report. The company saw revenue rise by 10% to reach $148 billion, which fell slightly short of analysts\u2019 expectations. However, it reported a notable increase in GAAP net income, which surged 94% to $1.26 per share, exceeding forecasts.\nOverall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of stocks discussed by Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "PR Newswire ",
        "Text": "DCK6 Workers Are First-Ever Amazon Warehouse Workers to Demand Recognition Outside of NLRB Election Process\n*Watch the announcement video here*\nSAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Today, over 100 Amazon workers at the company's DCK6 warehouse in San Francisco, Calif., formed a union with the Teamsters. The workers demanded union recognition from Amazon with a \"March on the Boss\" held early this morning. The DCK6 workers represent the first-ever group of Amazon warehouse workers to demand union recognition outside of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election process.\n\"We here at DCK6 are incredibly proud to be joining the Teamsters and taking Amazon workers' nationwide union effort to the next level,\" said Dori Goldberg, an Amazon DCK6 warehouse worker and Teamster in San Francisco. \"This organizing drive isn't about one worker or one warehouse \u2013 this is a ground-up movement to ensure all Amazon workers are treated fairly and with respect. Together, we're sending a clear message to Amazon that we will not back down. We will continue to fight for what we deserve.\"\nAmazon workers at DCK6 have been organizing with the Teamsters since last year and are fighting for better pay, safe working conditions, and a voice on the job. Many work part-time and are denied basic benefits.\n\"Amazon workers at DCK6 handle thousands of packages every day. We are essential to making sure that parents receive their baby formula on time and families get their gifts by the holidays,\" said Jocelyn Vargas, an Amazon DCK6 warehouse worker and Teamster in San Francisco. \"We need good pay and benefits to take care of our families too. That's why we formed a union with the Teamsters. We are essential workers, and it's time Amazon treats us that way.\"\nToday's announcement builds on the historic union momentum by Amazon workers across the country who are organizing in droves to improve their lives. Just last week, hundreds of Amazon drivers at the company's DBK4 facility in Queens, N.Y. formed a union with the Teamsters. Over the\u00a0summer, Amazon workers at\u00a0KCVG, the company's largest air hub in Kentucky, and KSBD, the company's largest air facility on the West Coast, walked off the job over Amazon's unfair labor practices. In June, Amazon Labor Union members voted to affiliate with the Teamsters by a near unanimous 98.3 percent in favor.\nBy joining together, Amazon workers nationwide are forcing critical changes at the e-commerce giant. In response to growing pressure by Amazon workers organizing with the Teamsters, the company recently announced raises for Amazon warehouse workers and Amazon drivers.\nAs DCK6 workers make historic inroads for Amazon warehouse workers, Amazon drivers continue to build nationwide momentum and pave the way for broader organizing wins. Amazon has long tried to avoid responsibility for its drivers by setting up Delivery Service Partners (DSPs) as their official employer. In August, Amazon drivers in Palmdale, Calif., secured a monumental victory when National Labor Relations Board Region 31 made a determination that Amazon is a joint employer of its drivers, and therefore has a legal duty to recognize and bargain with the Teamsters. This joint employer determination sets a major precedent and is applicable to Amazon drivers who work under similar conditions nationwide. Now Amazon will have to recognize and bargain with the Teamsters at any Amazon DSP in the country where a majority of the workers choose the Teamsters as their bargaining representative. Meanwhile, Amazon Teamsters from Palmdale\u00a0and Skokie, Ill., are currently on strike and extending their picket lines to facilities across the country.\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

        "Text": "Today, Amazon\u2019s subsidiary in-cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS), announced the signing of three new agreements to support the development of nuclear energy projects. The deals will enable, among other things, the construction of various new small modular reactors, or SMRs, Amazon said on Wednesday.\nMost Read from Fast Company\nHousing market\u2019s lock-in effect is so intense that existing home sales are at multi-decade lows \n\u2018She was trying to warn us\u2019: Why an old conspiracy theory about Beyonc\u00e9 and Sia is resurfacing online\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer just made it possible for 35,000 Michigan home health workers to unionize\nSMRs are an advanced form of nuclear reactor containing a small physical footprint that allows it to be built closer to the grid. On top of that, they have faster manufacturing times than traditional reactors, allowing them to come online sooner. Nuclear reactors also produce no carbon emissions.\nAmazon says today\u2019s announcement is part of its path to net-zero carbon emissions. Like other Big Tech companies, Amazon is seeing an increased need for clean energy as it grows its generative AI services.\n\u201cNuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040,\u201d said Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), in Amzon\u2019s report.\nAmazon is the latest Big Tech company to lean into nuclear power in the age of high-powered artificial intelligence. Earlier this week, Google signed an agreement to buy power from multiple small modular reactors. And last month, Constellation Energy announced a 20-year deal with Microsoft that would see it reopening its infamous Three Mile Island power plant.\nAWS signed an agreement with Washington State\u2019s Energy Northwest, a public power joint-operating agency. In the first phase of the project, the reactors are expected to generate about 320 megawatts (MW) of capacity, or the maximum amount of power that a plant can hold. It will have the option to increase to 960 MW\u2014enough energy to power 770,000 homes in the United States.\nThese projects are expected to meet the anticipated energy needs of the Pacific Northwest, starting in the early 2030s.\nAmazon says it is also investing in X-energy, a private nuclear-reactor-and-fuel-design engineering company. This investment will include the manufacturing capabilities to produce SMR equipment that will support more than five gigawatts of new nuclear energy projects using X-energy\u2019s technology.\nIn Virginia, Amazon signed an agreement with Dominion Energy, a utility company, to develop an SMR project near the existing nuclear power station, North Anna. AWS is hoping to bring at least 300 MW of power to the Virginia region. Dominion forecasts an 85% increase in power demand over the next 15 years.\n\u201cOne of the fastest ways to address climate change is by transitioning our society to carbon-free energy sources, and nuclear energy is both carbon-free and able to scale\u2014which is why it\u2019s an important area of investment for Amazon,\u201d said Garman.\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.comSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http://fastcompany.com/newsletters\n"

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Utility Dive newsletter. \nRecommended Reading \nTVA, GE Hitachi, 2 others commit to $400M international small modular reactor project\nAmazon has signed three agreements to support the development and deployment of small modular reactors in the United States, it said today.\nThe company entered into a deal with Energy Northwest, a consortium of 29 public utility districts and municipalities across Washington, to deploy four reactors developed by X-energy that will together generate approximately 320 MW of electricity beginning in the early 2030s, Amazon said.\nAmazon also revealed an equity investment in X-energy as part of an approximately $500 million fundraising round announced today by the nuclear technology company and a separate memorandum of understanding with Dominion Energy \u201cto explore innovative new development structures that would help advance potential [SMR] nuclear development in Virginia,\u201d according to a Dominion Energy news release.\nAmazon\u2019s announcements come the day after Google announced a deal with advanced nuclear reactor developer Kairos Power to deploy 500 MW of new generating capacity by 2035 and less than a month after Constellation Energy announced a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft that would allow the 835-MW Unit 1 reactor at Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania to restart.\nMicrosoft and Google are parties to the Advanced Clean Electricity initiative, which aims to spur development of clean, firm power generation technologies like advanced nuclear.\nThough Amazon is not an Advanced Clean Electricity initiative participant, it aims for net-zero carbon emissions across its operations by 2040. Amazon previously announced a deal with Talen Energy to purchase electricity in 120-MW increments from the independent power producer\u2019s 2,228-MW stake in the Susquehanna nuclear power plant.\u00a0\nUnder the deal, Amazon would use the electricity to power a data center colocated with the power plant. But AEP and Exelon say the agreement would shift up to $140 million in transmission costs to ratepayers.\u00a0\nAmazon\u2019s announcements today are focused on SMRs and support their deployment on the U.S. power grid.\u00a0\nThe company\u2019s investment in X-energy will support the completion of X-energy\u2019s reactor design and licensing and the first phase of its fuel fabrication facility in Tennessee, according to an X-energy news release.\u00a0\nAmazon and X-energy are also collaborating to bring more than 5 GW of new nuclear power projects online in the U.S. by 2039 and to develop a standardized \u201cdeployment and financing model to develop projects in partnership with infrastructure and utility partners,\u201d X-energy said. Those projects \u201cwill help meet growing energy demands in key locations through direct project investments and long-term power purchase agreements to help power Amazon operations,\u201d it said.\u00a0\nThe first phase of the Energy Northwest agreement would see the deployment of four 80-MW Xe-100 SMRs at the Columbia Generating Station in Richland, Washington. Future phases could add eight more reactors, bringing the site\u2019s total SMR generating capacity to approximately 960 MW, Energy Northwest said today.\nX-energy is separately developing a four-module, 320-MWe power plant at a Dow petrochemical plant in Texas. That project is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program and would be \u201cthe first grid-scale advanced nuclear reactor deployed to serve an industrial site in North America\u201d to provide both electricity and high-temperature steam, X-energy said.\nThe Xe-100 reactor will use TRISO fuel pellets produced at X-energy\u2019s Tennessee facility. TRISO is a novel and more stable fuel form that uses high-assay, low-enriched uranium, a more highly-enriched alternative to conventional low-enriched uranium.\nThrough its MOU with Dominion Energy, Amazon aims to deploy an SMR near the utility\u2019s North Anna nuclear generating station to add at least 300 MW of new capacity to the Virginia grid, Amazon said. The companies did not specify a reactor design for that project.\n"

        "Author": "PR Newswire ",
        "Text": "Complaint Comes as Amazon Drivers Nationwide Organize with Teamsters\nPALMDALE, Calif., Oct. 2, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The National Labor Relations Board Region 31 (NLRB) issued a formal complaint against Amazon affirming that the company is a joint employer of its Delivery Service Partner (DSP) drivers and has a legal duty to recognize and bargain with the Teamsters Union. The complaint charges Amazon with dozens of unfair labor practices that were deployed in an unsuccessful effort to thwart organizing efforts by Amazon delivery drivers represented by Teamsters Local 396 in Palmdale, Calif. The complaint also requires Amazon to have its DSP partners operating at the DAX8 fulfillment center in Palmdale offer positions to terminated drivers as a remedy to their unlawful conduct.\n\"Amazon wants to reap the benefits of drivers' labor without having to take on any of the responsibility for their wellbeing\u2014and those days are over,\" said Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien. \"This decision brings us one step closer to getting Amazon workers the pay, working conditions, and contracts they deserve. Amazon has no choice but to meet us at the negotiating table.\"\nAmazon is now required to respond to the complaint on or before October 15, 2024, and the NLRB will prosecute the corporate giant at a hearing on March 25, 2025 before an NLRB administrative law judge. The NLRB's complaint further sets the stage for the nearly 280,000 Amazon DSP drivers nationwide to organize with the Teamsters.\nAmong the unfair labor practices charged in the NLRB's complaint include Amazon unlawfully refusing to recognize the workers' decision to unionize with the Teamsters; failing and refusing to bargain with the Teamsters over conditions of employment and the effects of its decision to terminate its DSP's contract; threatening employees with job loss; holding unlawful captive audience meetings; intimidating employees with security guards; and other illegal retaliation against the group of newly unionized workers.\nIn addition to rehiring terminated Teamsters drivers, the NLRB is ordering Amazon to provide terminated employees with a neutral letter of reference, post NLRB's explanation of employee rights poster within the DAX8 facility for one year, and permit a board agent to conduct a training on the National Labor Relations Act and ULPs for all management employed at DAX8.\n\"Amazon can no longer hide behind its\u00a0DSP program to skirt responsibility for its driver workforce,\" said Bryant Cline, an Amazon driver and Local 396 member in Palmdale. \"Today's decision by the labor board makes official what we've long known to be true\u2014DSP drivers are Amazon employees, and we have a fundamental right to organize, unionize, and demand fair treatment and a contract from our multibillion-dollar employer.\"\nLast year, the 84 Amazon workers from Palmdale became the first group of Amazon delivery drivers in the country to organize a union. Since then, the Palmdale Teamsters have inspired other Amazon workers to take action, including drivers at Amazon's delivery station in Skokie, Illinois and Queens, New York.\nAmazon has avoided responsibility for its drivers through its DSP subcontractor business model, claiming DSP drivers are not official employees of Amazon. The NLRB's complaint rebuts Amazon's argument, proving Amazon exercises widespread control over drivers' working conditions, making Amazon the drivers' lawful employer.\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

The vision-based tech is designed to help drivers prioritize packages.\nVision-Assisted Package Retrieval (VAPR) works by highlighting packages with either a green circle or red light, denoting which are designated for delivery at the current stop. The company says such technology will save drivers from having to stop the van and shuffle to find the relevant packages each time.\nThere\u2019s also an audio cue that alerts the driver as to whether they have selected the appropriate packages. The company notes that doing so will eliminate the need for the kind of handheld devices that are currently ubiquitous among delivery drivers.\nAmazon says the VAPR system has been in the works since early 2020. \"We had to think about factors that are unique to the delivery experience, such as lighting and space constraints inside vans,\u201d product manager John Colucci said in a release.\nThe system is set to arrive on 1,000 of the retail giant\u2019s electric Rivian vans by early 2025.

        "Title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft, Amazon rating cuts; Robotaxi day disappoints",
        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\nOppenheimer analysts downgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock from Outperform to Perform on Tuesday, citing concerns about elevated consensus expectations for both revenue and earnings.\nA key issue raised by the firm\u2019s analysts is potential losses stemming from Microsoft's AI partner, OpenAI, which is expected to post a loss of around $5 billion this year. With Microsoft holding a 49% stake, the company could face significant financial impact as a result.\nThe downgrade also highlighted slower-than-expected enterprise adoption of AI technologies, which could lead to lower-than-anticipated revenue from AI-related services.\nIn addition, Oppenheimer pointed to rising capital expenditures (CapEx), particularly in high-performance computing, such as GPUs and data centers. The firm estimates that Microsoft's CapEx will hit $63 billion by 2025, a 14% year-over-year increase and double what it spent in 2023. Depreciation is also expected to rise by 28%, reaching $29 billion.\nThe analysts mentioned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s 50 basis point interest rate cut in September, will likely have a modest effect on Microsoft\u2019s net interest income from its $76 billion cash reserve.\nOppenheimer also expressed concerns over Microsoft\u2019s gross and EBITDA margins, which are expected to decline due to rising depreciation and operational costs linked to AI investments.\n\u201cThis will translate into 3% EPS growth in 1Q25 and we expect weakish guidance for 2025. We also think the Street estimates for EPS growth are ~200bps too high in FY26 and FY27,\u201d analysts said in a note.\nFurther risks include potential bottlenecks in data center capacity to meet anticipated GPU shipments and growing competition in the AI space, with other companies narrowing the gap on Microsoft.\nMicrosoft\u2019s stock currently trades in the middle of its five-year price-to-earnings range of 25x-35x, though Oppenheimer suggests it could drift toward the lower end of that spectrum.\nGoldman Sachs raised its price target for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $150 from $135 on Friday, reflecting an 11% potential upside.\nFollowing a recent investor meeting with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang, CFO Colette Kress, and IR representative Stewart Stecker, Goldman Sachs analysts expressed stronger confidence in Nvidia's competitive positioning, particularly as inference workloads become more complex.\n\"We came away from the NDR with a better appreciation of the company's competitive moat and, importantly, the projected increase in Inference workload complexity as well as its implications for future compute demand,\" the bank noted.\nGoldman Sachs highlighted several factors underpinning Nvidia\u2019s competitive advantage, including its large installed base, innovation at both the chip and data center levels, and its expanding software offerings.\nThe report specifically mentioned domain-specific libraries like Nvidia Parabricks, used for genomics analysis, and Nvidia AI Aerial, which supports cloud-native 5G networks.\nThe firm also raised its revenue and non-GAAP EPS estimates for FY2026/27 by 7% and 8%, respectively. This adjustment reflects higher cloud capex, strong AI server orders, and an improved outlook for chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) at TSMC.\nWells Fargo cut Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rating to Equal Weight from Overweight earlier in the week, pointing out several challenges that could halt the company\u2019s positive earnings revision momentum.\nThe bank also reduced its price target for Amazon to $183 from $225.\nAlthough Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains a strong performer, Wells Fargo stated it is \"not enough\" to drive upward estimate revisions in the near term.\nKey concerns include Amazon's investments in Project Kuiper, pressure from Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) fees, and slowing growth from its advertising business.\nThe firm also warned that \"margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well\" and suggested that positive revisions may not return until Amazon issues guidance in July 2025.\n\u201cWhile the market is more prepared for pressure on 4Q OI, we caution that margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well. As such, we move to Equal Weight until visibility into margin expansion resumes,\u201d Wells Fargo\u2019s team wrote.\nMoreover, Wells Fargo cut its operating income (OI) estimates for Amazon by $5.4 billion, $4.5 billion, and $5.5 billion for 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively, attributing the reductions to slower monetization of its merchant services and advertising businesses.\n\"Amazon remains a margin expansion story,\" according to the bank, but it noted that the rate of this expansion will likely be slower than what the market currently anticipates.\nThe note also highlighted rising competition from Walmart (NYSE:WMT), which has priced its fulfillment services 15% lower than Amazon's FBA, adding pressure to Amazon\u2019s market share.\nMorgan Stanley analysts voiced disappointment following Tesla's much-anticipated \"We, Robot\" event this week, citing a lack of key information about Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology, ride-sharing economics, and a clear go-to-market strategy for autonomous vehicles.\nTesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares dropped nearly 9% Friday, as several analysts pointed to the absence of detailed updates during the event.\nTesla did reveal its upcoming \"Cybercab,\" but Morgan Stanley remarked that the presentation lacked meaningful new insights. \"We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation,\" analysts said in a note.\nAhead of the event, Morgan Stanley had anticipated significant updates on Tesla\u2019s FSD technology, such as measurable improvements in miles driven without disengagements, but these specifics were not provided.\nThe Wall Street firm also expected details on the strategy behind the company's supervised and unsupervised ride-sharing services, including economic analysis and estimates for the total addressable market (TAM).\n\"We had expected at least some incremental information around the 'rate of change' of the FSD system,\" it explained.\nFurthermore, the event did not provide any meaningful discussion on Tesla\u2019s collaboration with xAI or updates on Tesla\u2019s \"Master Plan 4,\" leaving Morgan Stanley analysts to conclude that the event failed to significantly move forward Tesla\u2019s narrative as an AI-focused company.\nCapital Economics warned in a Friday note that escalating trade disputes between the US and China, or a sharp rise in tensions between China and Taiwan, represent significant geopolitical risks that could \u201cprick the AI bubble.\u201d\nWhile tech stocks have seen strong performance this year, the firm cautioned that the rally could stall as geopolitical risks intensify, especially with the US presidential election approaching.\nA central concern is Taiwan\u2019s critical role in the AI supply chain. Taiwanese companies control around 90% of the market for advanced chips and AI servers, key drivers of the AI capital expenditure boom among major tech firms.\nAccording to Capital Economics, any disruption in this supply chain due to geopolitical conflict could have severe consequences.\n\"China could restrict the flow of highly advanced semiconductor chips and AI servers from Taiwan to the US, thereby breaking the 'AI supply chain,'\" the firm emphasized in a note.\nOn the US-China trade front, the report points to potential risks of heightened tensions after the 2024 US presidential election.\nIf Donald Trump returns to office, strategists anticipate \"a significant increase in tariffs on Chinese goods\" and a broader shift away from free trade, which would raise costs for tech companies. Even under a Harris administration, which is expected to maintain current export controls, there is still considerable risk to the tech sector.\nRelated Articles\n5 big analyst AI moves: Microsoft, Amazon rating cuts; Robotaxi day disappoints\nMoon race, private competition in focus as space powers gather in Milan\nBASF downgraded to 'neutral' by UBS amid earnings growth concerns for 2025\n"

        "Title": "Second regional NLRB office rules that Amazon, delivery service partners employ drivers jointly",
        "Author": "  John Kingston ",
        "Text": "The relationship between Amazon and drivers for the company\u2019s delivery service partners (DSPs) continues to generate outcomes with potentially major implications.\nThe most significant development in recent weeks is the decision by a regional office of the National Labor Relations Board that Amazon and one of its DSPs \u2013 the companies that actually bring those packages to your door \u2013 are joint employers of the DSP workers. It\u2019s the second such decision just since August.\nThe finding is also directly opposite what Amazon has long claimed: that workers at DSPs are employees of the DSPs, not of Amazon, and that the DSPs are independent businesses not under the control of Amazon.\n\nThe director of NLRB Region 10, based in Atlanta, in September made a \u201cmerit determination\u201d that workers at MJB LLC, a DSP operating out of an Amazon facility, are joint employees of Amazon and MJB. A group of MJB employees, working with the Teamsters, had sought to unionize at the company.\nAccording to a statement issued by the NLRB at the time of the finding, the director in the more recent finding also uncovered evidence of antiunion activities at the facility.\n\u201cThe Regional Director found merit to the allegations that the joint-employers unlawfully made coercive statements and gave the impression of surveillance,\u201d the NLRB said. \u201cShe also determined that the joint-employers made threats of unspecified reprisal, threats of plant closure\u2026if workers at the location formed a union.\u201d\nThe NLRB statement makes an important point: that while the question of joint employer status will be crucial, it\u2019s not the only issue between Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and the Teamsters in Atlanta. The question of what a company can do to resist unionization also will be key as the case makes its way through the legal process.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Amazon noted that not all of the Teamsters\u2019 allegations were upheld by the regional director. \u201cThis complaint makes clear that the Teamsters have been misrepresenting the facts here for over 15 months, which is why the NLRB has not included most of their larger allegations,\u201d Amazon spokeswoman Eileen Hards said in an email to FreightWaves. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said all along, there is no merit to any of their claims. We look forward to showing that as the legal process continues and expect the few remaining allegations will be dismissed as well.\u201d\nIn a revised definition of joint employers put into effect in late 2023, the NLRB said that \u201ctwo or more entities may be considered joint employers of a group of employees if each entity has an employment relationship with the employees, and if the entities share or codetermine one or more of the employees\u2019 essential terms and conditions of employment.\u201d\nThe action is the second recent finding of a joint employer relationship. In combination with one from California just a few weeks earlier, it has the broader potential to disrupt the current legal status of Amazon and its DSPs.\nIn August, a regional director of the NLRB in the Los Angeles region made a similar finding in a case involving a DSP called Battle Tested Strategies (BTS). The director concluded the Palmdale, California, company and Amazon were joint employers.\nIn a prepared statement, the NLRB noted that when a regional director makes a merit determination, it is \u201cthe first step in the NLRB\u2019s General Counsel litigating the allegations after investigating an unfair labor practice charge.\u201d\nThe parties in the dispute then have the option of settling. If not, a formal complaint will be issued and a hearing before an NLRB administrative law judge (ALJ) will be scheduled. The ALJ can \u201corder make-whole remedies.\u201d\nWhatever the decision is by the ALJ, it can be appealed to the entire NLRB board. If there is still an unhappy side in the dispute, it can be taken into the federal court system.\nThe formal complaint in the BTS case was filed this week by NLRB Region 31. Among its numerous charges, it lays out the heart of the dispute that could have broader ramifications: \u201cAt all material times, Respondent Amazon possessed and exercised control over the labor relations policy of Respondent BTS and administered a common labor policy with Respondent BTS for the employees of Respondent BTS at [Amazon\u2019s] DAX8 facility.\u201d\n\nThe workers in Palmdale at Battle Tested Strategies were described in a Teamsters statement as the first group of DSP workers who unionized.\nAnother group of DSP workers who voted in favor of being represented by the Teamsters was in Skokie, Illinois, at a company called Four Star Express Delivery. That ended in a strike and \u2013 like what happened at BTS \u2013 the termination of the company\u2019s contract to serve as an Amazon DSP.\nMJB, at the center of the second NLRB preliminary finding of joint employer status, was the target of a Teamsters unionization drive. But there is no report in the NLRB database of unionization elections of a vote having occurred at MJB.\nThe drive for unionization of DSPs took another recent step forward in Queens, New York, where workers at three separate DSPs working out of Amazon\u2019s DBK4 facility in September stated their desire to be represented by the Teamsters via a \u201ccard check\u201d action.\nIn card check, workers sign cards stating their desire to become union members. It is controversial because while a worker voting \u201cno\u201d in a secret ballot can keep that desire hidden, an employee acting on that opposition by refusing to sign a card in a card check drive cannot. But it can be accepted by the NLRB as an approved way of a union organizing a group of workers.\nThe Teamsters, in announcing the action, described the number of workers at the facility as being in the hundreds. (This video reportedly is of a union rally at the Queens facility, though when it took place is not noted.)\nAmazon recently increased the minimum pay for its DSP drivers to approximately $22 per hour with the help of increasing investments in its \u201crate cards.\u201d That is up from $20.50.\nHards said the minimums at Amazon are part of an effort to maintain a basic level of pay and that individual DSPs can pay higher if they choose.\n\u201cWe do have a program agreement, but all our DSPs make decisions on how they schedule their employees, who they hire, what exactly they pay them and all those important employment decisions,\u201d Hards said. \u201cSo just because we\u2019re partners and we have high expectations for them does not mean we run their small independent businesses.\u201d\nThe BTS case is notable because the claim by union bakers is that BTS, having recognized the union after its rank and file had voted to be represented by the Teamsters, had its DSP status yanked by Amazon soon after in retaliation. But the formal NLRB complaint, while noting the termination of BTS\u2019 DSP status, does not say anything to support that claim.\nAmazon has yet to sign a collective bargaining agreement with any union. The most significant unionization win was at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse with a successful drive by a grassroots union tied to no national organization. It has since aligned with the Teamsters. But no contract with Amazon has been signed.\nAmazon also beat back a highly publicized effort to unionize warehouse workers at Bessemer, Alabama, in 2021. However, that unionization drive was conducted by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Workers Union, not the Teamsters.\nWhile there is no clear data, Amazon DSP drivers are believed to be overwhelmingly W-2 employees of their DSPs. Their wages are paid by the DSP as part of a salary or an hourly rate, and their income is reported to them at tax time through an IRS W-2 form from the IRS.\nAny drivers working as independent contractors would be considered 1099 workers and receive that IRS form for the purposes of income tax payments.\nSome other recent developments with the Teamsters have been mostly positive from the union\u2019s perspective.\nIt added 160 workers to its ranks when drivers in Florida at Breakthru Beverages voted to align with Teamsters Local 79, according to the union.\nAnd that is just another addition to a Teamsters claim that is difficult to independently confirm: that it has added 50,000 workers as members in the past two and a half years.\nBesides traditional outlets for organizing, Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien said in a statement that \u201corganizers have also found runaway success bringing more workers into the labor movement at once non-traditional companies, including Amazon, the American Red Cross, Costco, and cannabis dispensaries nationwide.\u201d\nMore articles by John Kingston\nClosures continue on I-40 and I-26 in North Carolina, I-40 in Tennessee\nBill that could hinder warehouse growth in California signed by Newsom\nThe post Second regional NLRB office rules that Amazon, delivery service partners employ drivers jointly appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Text": "Investing.com -- RBC Capital Markets announced a quarterly update to its \u201cTop 30 Global Ideas List,\u201d adding eight new stocks, including Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS), while removing seven, one of them being Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\nThe inclusion of Pinterest comes amid the social media company\u2019s strong growth potential, driven by increased ad relevance and conversion through initiatives such as direct links and a partnership with third-party retail media.\nThese changes are expected to significantly improve return on ad spend (ROAS), with Pinterest\u2019s stock poised for a potential upward re-rating as growth reaccelerates to around 20%. RBC notes that the company is not reliant on U.S. user base expansion, as even its current users are seen as capable of driving higher growth through better ad engagement.\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s unclear whether these changes will be a tailwind to US monthly active users (MAUs), we think the current user base is under-monetized to a degree that the company doesn\u2019t necessarily need to grow US users meaningfully in order to accelerate revenue growth and drive margins higher.\u201d\nRBC set an Outperform rating on Pinterest stock with a price target of $48, representing a 48% upside from current levels.\nIn addition to Pinterest, several other stocks were added to RBC\u2019s list this quarter, including American International Group (NYSE:AIG), Cameco (NYSE:CCJ), Healthequity Inc (NASDAQ:HQY), and Zalando SE (ETR:ZALG).\nAt the same time, Amazon, along with other notable names like Chubb (NYSE:CB) and Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), was removed from the list.\nAmazon's stock fell by 6.8% in Q3 2024, underperforming RBC's broader Top 30 list, which delivered a 7.8% total return during the quarter.\nRBC analysts, however, continue to see long-term value in Amazon, particularly in its AWS division, though it was removed in favor of higher-conviction ideas.\nAmerican Homes (NYSE:AMH) 4 Rent, Marks and Spencer Group PLC (LON:MKS), Restaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR), and S&P Global Inc (NYSE:SPGI) were also removed.\nRelated Articles\nPinterest added to RBC's 'Top 30 Global Ideas List', Amazon out\nStellantis to halt production of electric Fiat 500 for longer due to poor demand\nAnalysis-Global investors gear up to go back into China\n"

        "Text": "PDCK6 Workers Are First-Ever Amazon Warehouse Workers to Demand Recognition Outside of NLRB Election Process\nSAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 4, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Amazon Teamsters at the company's DCK6 warehouse in San Francisco were joined by San Francisco Mayor London Breed and Board Supervisor Shamann Walton at a rally and press conference yesterday to demand Amazon recognize the workers' newly formed union. At the event, the DCK6 workers held signs that read \"Support Amazon Teamsters\" and \"People Over Packages.\" Video from yesterday's press conference and rally can be found\u00a0here.\n\"California Teamsters know what it means to go up against some of the country's biggest tech giants, stand our ground, and win\u2013and it's no different for Amazon workers at DCK6,\" said Peter Finn, Teamsters Western Region International Vice President and President of Teamsters Joint Council 7. \"The truth is that this is a losing battle for Amazon. Despite the millions of dollars Amazon is funneling into union busting, when thousands of workers start coming together across all corners of the country to demand a voice and a fair paycheck, Goliath doesn't stand a chance.\"\nYesterday's action comes just one day after DCK6 workers formed a union with the Teamsters and marched on Amazon management to demand union recognition. The DCK6 workers represent the first-ever group of Amazon warehouse workers to demand union recognition outside of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election process.\n\"I'm proud to stand in San Francisco with this group of newly organized Amazon Teamsters who want nothing more than to be treated with fairness and respect,\" said Breed. \"These workers do backbreaking work yet are struggling to get by while Amazon executives take home millions. The good news is that they now have the full weight of the Teamsters behind them, and we know they have the tenacity needed to take on Amazon. It's time they are given what they are owed.\"\nAmazon workers at DCK6 have been organizing with the Teamsters since last year and are fighting for better pay, safe working conditions, and a voice on the job. Many work part time and are denied basic benefits.\n\"Forming a union is no easy task, especially in the face of a company as greedy and anti-worker as Amazon, but we've organized successfully with the Teamsters and built incredible worker power at DCK6. It's time Amazon recognizes that,\" said Josh Black, an Amazon warehouse worker at DCK6.\n\"All of us at DCK6 are grateful for the support of Mayor London Breed and Board Supervisor Shamann Walton, along with all of the elected leaders, labor allies, family, and friends who have supported our journey in forming a union. We're proud to be a part of this nationwide organizing drive and to hold Amazon to account with our Teamsters siblings.\"\nYesterday's announcement builds on the historic union momentum by Amazon workers across the country who are organizing in droves to improve their lives. Just last week, hundreds of Amazon drivers at the company's DBK4 facility in Queens, N.Y.,\u00a0formed a union\u00a0with the Teamsters. Over the summer, Amazon workers at KCVG, the company's largest air hub in Kentucky, and KSBD, the company's largest air facility on the West Coast,\u00a0walked off the job\u00a0over Amazon's unfair labor practices. In June, Amazon Labor Union members\u00a0voted to affiliate\u00a0with the Teamsters by a near unanimous 98.3 percent in favor.\nBy joining together, Amazon workers nationwide are forcing critical changes at the e-commerce giant. In response to growing pressure by Amazon workers organizing with the Teamsters, the company recently announced raises for Amazon warehouse workers and\u00a0Amazon drivers.\nAs DCK6 workers make historic inroads for Amazon warehouse workers, Amazon drivers continue to build nationwide momentum and pave the way for broader organizing wins. Amazon has long tried to avoid responsibility for its drivers by setting up Delivery Service Partners (DSPs) as their official employer. Just this week, Amazon drivers in Palmdale, Calif. secured a monumental victory when NLRB Region 31 issued a\u00a0formal complaint\u00a0against Amazon, reaffirming that the\u00a0company is a joint employer of its drivers and has a legal duty to recognize and bargain with the Teamsters.\nThis joint employer determination sets a major precedent and is applicable to Amazon drivers who work under similar conditions nationwide. Now Amazon will have to recognize and bargain with the Teamsters at any Amazon DSP in the country where a majority of the workers choose the Teamsters as their bargaining representative. Meanwhile, Amazon Teamsters from\u00a0Palmdale\u00a0and\u00a0Skokie, Ill.,\u00a0are currently on strike and extending their picket lines to facilities\u00a0across\u00a0the\u00a0country.\n\"Despite Amazon pulling every anti-union tactic out of its back pocket to try and slow our organizing momentum, the reality is that our union drive is only speeding up. Amazon is running out of options,\" said Jocelyn Vargas, an Amazon warehouse worker at DCK6. \"For too long, we've put up with rampant disrespect on the job, dangerous working conditions, and unlivable wages, all while we help push out tens of thousands of packages to Amazon customers every single day. We formed a union because the system is broken, and we need a voice on the job to fix it.\"\nFounded in 1903, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 1.3 million hardworking people in the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

        "Author": "  Ben Andrews ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nCanon has filed a lawsuit in conjunction with Amazon.com against sellers of counterfeit toner cartridges being sold on the Amazon US store. Canon Inc. and Canon USA, Inc. announced on Wednesday October 3 that they had filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington against 18 sellers accused of selling counterfeit products, infringing Canon's trademark rights. This isn't the first time Canon and Amazon have joined forces to clamp down on trademark infringement - in May 2023 Amazon sued 29 of its own Marketplace sellers for selling fake Lithium-ion batteries that carried Canon branding.\nAccording to Canon, batteries, printer ink and toner are common products to be counterfeited, likely due to their relative ease of production and potentially high profit margins. In response to the issue, Canon has become increasingly strict on which batteries can be used in its Cameras, with recent news reports claiming cameras like the EOS R5 Mark II are incompatible with third-party batteries. Preventing non-genuine ink and toner cartridges from working in a printer through the use of security chips has long been common practice. However, it should be noted that this latest Canon lawsuit isn't targeted at sellers of third-party, compatible toner cartridges clearly marketed as being non-genuine, but rather fake toners carrying the Canon logo and branding.\nAs with the counterfeit battery lawsuit in 2023, this issue continues to raise questions over Amazon's ability to police its own Marketplace platform. If Amazon already had tighter control over its Marketplace listings, fraudulent sellers could potentially never have been allowed to sell on the platform, and therefore counterfeit Canon products wouldn't have reached consumers.\nStory credit: Digital Camera Watch\n"

The partnership will support future carbon-free projects that will use X-energy\u2019s Xe-100 advanced SMRs as well as long-term power purchase agreements to power Amazon operations, including energy-intensive data centers.\nThrough its collaboration with Amazon, X-energy plans to build one of North America\u2019s first grid-scale advanced nuclear reactors with Energy Northwest in Washington state, initially supporting one four-unit 320-megawatt (MW) high-temperature gas reactor plant with the option to increase that project to 12 units and 960 MW.\nIn September 2022, Curtiss-Wright and X-energy signed a preferred strategic supplier agreement to advance the design and deployment of X-energy\u2019s advanced reactor, which is expected to provide the capability to both generate electricity or provide process heat for industrial applications.

To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2347643/the-cheapest-mag-7-stocks-in-2024\nWelcome to Episode #385 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\u00a0\n(0:30) - Can You Find Value Within The Magnificent 7?\n(6:15) - Breaking Down Recent Performances: What Stocks To Keep On Your Radar?\n(28:30) - Episode Roundup: META, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, TSLA\n Podcast@Zacks.com\n\u00a0\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\nIt\u2019s time to check in on the Mag 7 stocks, formerly known as FAANG stocks or FANGMAN stocks. The Mag 7 stocks are the large cap innovators with high growth. The Mag 7 includes Tesla, NVIDIA, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Meta Platforms.\nTracey has often discussed how value investors can own both growth and value stocks. Value investors are not limited only to value stocks.\nWhy not look at the largest big cap growth stocks out there? Why not own some Mag 7 stocks?\nBut just because a value investor might buy a growth stock, doesn\u2019t mean that investor doesn\u2019t want attractive valuations. A \u201ccheap\u201d stock, for value investors, doesn\u2019t mean the share price. Cheapness is not talking about a stock under $1.00. Cheapness means the company\u2019s valuations are attractive.\nFor value investors, valuations are often determined by looking at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. P/E ratios are usually the first default though, so Tracey looked at them for this podcast.\nThe P/E ratio is price divided by earnings.\nBut there\u2019s a good case for the P/S ratio, especially when looking at technology stocks.\nTracey considers both on the podcast.\n1. Tesla, Inc. TSLA\nTesla has underperformed so far in 2024. Shares of Tesla are down 3.1% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 19.4%.\nBut the sell-off doesn\u2019t mean Tesla is cheap. It\u2019s trading with a forward P/E of 113, which is at the nosebleed levels. And it has a P/S ratio of 8.7. That\u2019s not cheap but at least it\u2019s under 10.\nIs Tesla a deal on the weakness or is it a value trap?\n2. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN\nHas Amazon EVER been cheap? Investors have always paid a premium for the stock, at least on a P/E basis. But Amazon is currently trading with a forward P/E of 39, which is among its lowest P/E ratios over the last decade.\nShares of Amazon have gained 19% year-to-date yet it\u2019s still sporting an attractive P/E. Earnings are expected to rise 63.5% this year and 23% next year, which explains it.\nBut it is Amazon\u2019s P/S ratio which is the real surprise. It has P/S ratio of just 3.2, the lowest of the Mag 7.\nShould Amazon be on a value investor\u2019s short list?\n3. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\nNVIDIA can\u2019t be a deal, can it? It has been one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street this year. Shares of NVIDIA are up 157.9% year-to-date. But earnings are also expected to be up 116% this year and another 33% in fiscal 2026.\nNVIDIA is trading with a forward P/E of \u201cjust\u201d 41.5. But that is well under Tesla at 113x, and other growth stocks like Costco, which is trading at 49x.\nIs NVIDIA still a buy here?\n4. Apple Inc. AAPL\nWarren Buffett might have sold a bunch of his Apple position in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio this year, but he still owns a big chunk of shares. And if the greatest value investor ever owns your stock, there must be some value there, right?\nBut Apple isn\u2019t that cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 30. Earnings are expected to be up this year, but just 9.3%. Shares of Apple have gained 15.1% year-to-date.\nIs Apple losing its shine with value investors in 2024?\n5. Meta Platforms, Inc. META\nMeta Platforms has been a quiet winner in 2024. Shares of Meta Platforms are up 65.2% year-to-date.\nIt\u2019s a growth stock. Earnings are expected to rise 43.6% this year and another 12.8% next year. But Meta Platforms also has an attractive forward P/E of just 27. And it\u2019s now paying a dividend, yielding 0.4%.\nIs Meta Platforms the cheapest Mag 7 stock?\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL, MSFT and AMZN in her personal portfolio.]\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Text": "Shakira calls on Hispanic youth to learn how to code and join the computer science movement during Hispanic Heritage Month\nSEATTLE, Oct. 8, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Code.org announced today a new partnership with Amazon and Grammy award-winning recording artist and global humanitarian Shakira, through her foundation, Fundaci\u00f3n Pies Descalzos, to expand access to computer science education for Spanish-speaking students around the globe. This partnership leverages Shakira's star power to raise awareness around the importance of computer science education for Spanish and Latin American students to prepare them for success in an increasingly tech-first workforce and world.\n\"Computer science is about more than just coding; it's about teaching students the problem-solving, creativity, and critical thinking skills that are essential in today's digitally-driven world,\" said Hadi Partovi, CEO and co-founder of Code.org. \"Collaborating with Shakira to expand access to computer science education for Hispanic students worldwide is a critical part of our mission to prepare all students to thrive in the future workforce.\"\nShakira has been a long-time advocate for advancing equity in education through Fundaci\u00f3n Pies Descalzos, a non-profit organization she founded which is dedicated to addressing the educational needs of students in Colombia and across Latin America through sustainable infrastructure, teacher training, and curricular innovation. To date, the Foundation has supported more than 224,000 children of different backgrounds, ethnicities, and cultural traditions in Colombia providing a protective space for learning as well as serving as a transformative social engine for communities.\nShakira shared, \"I'm happy to partner once again with Code.org to be part of highlighting both the importance of computer science learning and its different applications including in the world of music creation; and to contribute in helping Hispanic students gain access to a field that has gained major relevance in today's industries and will only continue to do so.\"\nTo celebrate the partnership, Shakira has donated use of her top Spanish-language hits including \"Amarillo\" and \"Chantaje\" in Music Lab, the popular platform from Code.org and Amazon where students can learn to code through interactive music composition featuring chart-topping hits from artists around the globe.\nThanks to a donation by Amazon's Future Engineer program, Code.org and Fundaci\u00f3n Pies Descalzos kicked-off the partnership with the first of a series of computer science teacher training workshops in September 2024, in Barranquilla, Colombia. A total of 25 teachers from public schools managed by Fundaci\u00f3n Pies Descalzos in Barranquilla and Cartagena participated, impacting nearly 2,400 students across both cities.\nThe workshops are designed to equip teachers with the tools and pedagogy needed to introduce elementary-age students to foundational computer science concepts. Teacher trainings hosted by Code.org and Fundaci\u00f3n Pies Descalzos will continue through 2025, starting in February with the training of an additional 100 teachers. The project seeks to enrich and enhance student skills in language, mathematics, and computer programming by improving pedagogical practices and student learning practices in the STEM sciences, thus helping close the gap in education for communities in need.\n\"At Amazon, we believe access to high-quality computer science education is crucial for preparing all students, especially those from underrepresented communities, to thrive in the digital economy,\" said Victor Reinoso, global director of Amazon's philanthropic education initiatives. \"We're proud to partner with Code.org, Shakira and Fundaci\u00f3n Pies Descalzos to expand opportunities for Hispanic students to learn coding and computational thinking skills. Through this collaboration, we can help unlock the potential of the next generation of innovators and empower Hispanic youth with the tech skills needed for future success.\"\nIn the last year, Code.org has expanded access to computer science education for 1 million students and 50,000 teachers across Spain and Latin America.

Each year, students across Spain and Latin America participate in the annual Hour of Code, an initiative that introduces millions of K-12 worldwide students to coding.

        "Author": "  Big Screen Entertainment Group ",
        "Text": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., Oct. 03, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Big Screen Entertainment Group (OTC: BSEG) is poised to capitalize on the explosive growth of the audio entertainment market with the expansion of its hit wartime drama AVENGER FIELD into a five-part series for Amazon\u2019s Audible platform. Originally conceived as a one-off production, the overwhelming response to the pilot has led to the development of a full series, with potential for future seasons.\nAVENGER FIELD chronicles the riveting true story of the female American pilots who took to the skies from Texas\u2019 Avenger Field airbase during WWII, merging cinematic storytelling with the immersive power of audio.\nWith its in-house writing and development team, Big Screen Entertainment is leveraging its expertise to deliver a premium, radio-style play, featuring a talented roster of accomplished TV and film actors. The expansion into audio comes at a time when the medium is experiencing skyrocketing popularity, especially on platforms like Audible, which is supported by Amazon\u2019s global reach.\n\u201cFrom the performances to the soundscape, we knew early on that we had something special,\u201d said BSEG CEO Kimberley Kates. \u201cOur vision is to not only entertain but to honor the incredible legacy of these pioneering women aviators. We\u2019re just scratching the surface of where this project can go.\u201d\nABOUT BSEG\n1. A Growing and Diversifying Slate:Big Screen Entertainment Group is well-positioned for long-term growth with a strong pipeline of upcoming productions across multiple platforms. The company\u2019s expansion into audio content, particularly with a series tied to a historical subject as compelling as AVENGER FIELD, represents a strategic move into a fast-growing sector. Should the series gain traction on Audible, it opens the door for cross-platform expansion, including potential film and TV adaptations, international syndication, and franchise development.\n2. Capitalizing on Audio's Boom:The audio entertainment market, particularly podcasts and audio dramas, is experiencing unprecedented demand, forecasted to exceed $15 billion in value over the next few years. With AVENGER FIELD set to release on Audible next year, Big Screen is well-placed to capture a portion of this expanding market. Early successes like this series could unlock substantial new revenue streams for BSEG, including licensing deals, merchandising, and future content collaborations with major platforms.\n3. Proven Track Record with Star Talent:BSEG has a legacy of delivering high-quality productions for both U.S. and international audiences. The expansion of AVENGER FIELD comes on the heels of other successful projects, reinforcing the company's reputation for blending artistic vision with commercial appeal. With top-tier creative talent and voice actors attached, the series is likely to attract significant attention upon release, driving brand value and audience growth.\n4. Positioned for a Global Audience:Amazon\u2019s Audible platform provides Big Screen with access to millions of listeners worldwide. This broad exposure can accelerate the company\u2019s growth and position BSEG as a significant player not only in traditional film and TV production, but also in the lucrative audio content space. Future expansions into international markets could bring even greater value to investors as the company taps into a global storytelling ecosystem.\nWith an expanding portfolio of films, TV shows, and now audio dramas, Big Screen Entertainment Group continues to demonstrate its ability to pivot and adapt to new media trends.\nBig Screen Entertainment Group Based in Beverly Hills, Big Screen Entertainment Group is a seasoned production and distribution company specializing in delivering content across film, television, and now audio platforms.

But when he arrives she gets it. The guy is a jammer.\nAccording to the super-fun Internal Revenue Service, jammers are the ultra-rich who commit suicide to evade taxes.

Becoming an Amazon bestseller and quickly capturing the attention of art collectors and enthusiasts worldwide, she further bagged number one bestseller position in various categories, including Business in Art and Women in Art, for both Kindle and hardcover formats, within two days of its launch, making her the top author in this genre across Europe and the USA. The book is a part-guide, part-memoir aimed towards young collectors and artists to learn how to develop their taste, get involved in collecting, and navigate the industry.

        "Title": "College grads struggle to find work at Google, Amazon, and Meta as tech hiring stalls",
        "Author": "  Jenn Brice ",
        "Text": "When the current class of college seniors started their studies four years ago, tech companies were hiring new graduates as fast as they could. Now, amid a downturn in Silicon Valley that has included thousands of layoffs, job seekers who are about to get their diplomas are scrambling to find work.\nThe signs of trouble are easy to spot at University of California at Berkeley, usually a hotbed for tech recruiting.\nSome of the Big Tech companies have pulled out of recruitment and branding partnerships they previously had with the campus career services office.\nIt\u2019s taking longer for students to land jobs. To make themselves more marketable, some students are doubling down on courses in AI and data engineering, two areas that haven\u2019t been hit as hard as others in the tech industry.\nMeanwhile, many students are applying for jobs at smaller companies now that Big Tech\u2019s Google, Amazon, and Facebook-parent Meta have cut tens of thousands of workers over the past two years.\n\u201cStudents are frustrated,\u201d Santina Pitcher, senior associate director of employer relations at U.C. Berkeley\u2019s career center, tells Fortune.\nThe unease among job seekers is being felt across the country. Once a sponge for new graduates, the tech industry has cut back on filling high-paying jobs and is far more selective.\nSo far this year, tech companies laid off nearly 140,000 workers, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks job cuts. That\u2019s on top of more than 264,000 people cut from tech last year.\nThings won\u2019t necessarily get better anytime soon for college graduates. Silicon Valley is increasingly using artificial intelligence to help software engineers speed up the process of writing code, reducing the need for hiring more programmers.\nIn a potential sign of the shift, job postings for software engineers have fallen more than 160% since post-pandemic hiring peaked in March 2022, according to data from Indeed, the online job board. That\u2019s a far bigger drop than for non-tech roles.\nIn response to the souring market, young professionals are seeking tech jobs outside the usual suspects, such as with small businesses and government, according to new data from Handshake, a recruiting site for college students. It found that 42% of today\u2019s computer science students have applied for full-time jobs at small businesses, up from around 25% in 2022.\nOf any college major, that\u2019s the largest jump in interest in small businesses, defined as having 250 workers or less. Such companies may not have the perks of bigger ones like ping-pong tables and offsite retreats at wellness ranches, but they can offer more stable roles and a direct social impact on local communities, Handshake\u2019s report notes.\nAnother report by Handshake in May found that the Class of 2024 is applying to more government jobs. About 7.5% of job applications from new grads were for public sector work, up from 5.5% for the Class of 2023.\nOverall, the job market is relatively strong. The U.S. added 254,000 jobs in total in September, according to federal government employment data. The gains were largely driven by hiring in the education and health sectors, leisure and hospitality, and government. In contrast, the information services sector, which includes the tech industry, grew slowly, contributing less than 10,000 jobs last month.\nAt Berkeley, the shift in the tech industry is having a big impact. The number of employers showing up at STEM-major career fairs has remained relatively stable since the pandemic at around 100. But aside from Alphabet\u2019s self-driving car unit Waymo, Big Tech is absent. Instead, the sponsors include Bloomberg and TikTok, along with the U.S. State Department and the Peace Corps.\n\u201cI'm seeing more interest from startups and smaller companies, and the bigger ones are backing off a little bit,\u201d Pitcher said.\nAt Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, a similar trend is playing out, said Kevin Collins, associate director of the campus career center. Students must work harder to land roles than they did before the pandemic. His advice: Look beyond the usual online job boards, attend networking events, and be more open minded about employers.\n\u201cThey're still doing tech roles, but they're doing it in different industries and smaller companies in general,\u201d Collins said.\nCarnegie Mellon is known for strong robotics and computer science programs, and its graduates have historically been snapped up by the likes of Google and Uber. This year it topped College Transition\u2019s list of schools that feed talent to Silicon Valley.\nAnd while there are still opportunities for new grads in Big Tech, Collins said, huge West Coast tech companies have scaled back their once aggressive campus recruiting efforts since the pandemic. Instead, some tech students are taking jobs in traditional industries, like financial services, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably a healthier market in the sense it is broader,\u201d Collins said.\nMadeleine Brutin knew the job market would be competitive when she started as a Carnegie Mellon student in 2022. The day she got her university email address, she says she messaged the career services office. As a freshman, she\u2019d already heard from upperclassmen about the competitiveness of the job market, as companies rescinded offers amid post-pandemic downsizing.\nSearching for a full-time position is still stressful today, Brutin said.\n\u201cYou can go months or days without hearing from a company, and you're at a fork in the road where you're wondering should you apply more? Should you build more skills? Or should you just keep waiting?\u201d she said.\nBrutin, who studies computational finance, looked beyond the Silicon Valley \u201cpure tech\u201d companies. While still job hunting, she already secured an offer for a full-time position at Bloomberg after previously interning there.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Meet the Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing in the $1 Trillion Club by 2035",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the biggest secular tailwinds in recent years is the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). The latest advancements in AI went viral early last year, and the list of companies in the $1 trillion club is littered with businesses on the leading edge of this next-generation technology.\nFor example, Apple products -- including Siri and Maps -- have always embraced AI, while Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have developed seemingly impenetrable moats by integrating AI deeply into their respective business operations. Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have developed the chips that make AI possible.\nNetflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is one of the pioneers of AI, using cutting-edge algorithms to inform its streaming recommendations and production choices, yet the company has fallen out of favor with some who are busy chasing the latest shiny new thing. Investors might be surprised to learn that Netflix just delivered another quarter of double-digit growth. With a market cap of just $324 billion, it might seem premature to suggest Netflix is bucking to join its peers in the trillion-dollar club, yet the stock has gained more than 100% over the past year and 1,380% over the past decade, and the evidence suggests its ascent will continue.\nNetflix just reported its third-quarter results and sailed past expectations on every important metric. Revenue of $9.83 billion climbed 15% year over year, generating robust profit growth as earnings per share (EPS) of $5.40 soared 45%. Revenue was fueled by strong paid subscriber growth that jumped by more than 5 million, an increase of 14%. The bottom line was driven higher by an expanding operating margin that increased by an incredible 720 basis points to 29.6%.\nFor context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $9.77 billion and EPS of $5.12, accompanied by subscriber additions of 4.5 million, so Netflix beat across the board.\nPerhaps more importantly, management expects its growth streak to continue. Netflix is guiding for fourth-quarter revenue of $10.1 billion, up nearly 15%, while EPS of $4.23 would more than double.\nOn the conference call to discuss the results, Netflix laid out plans to continue its impressive growth, highlighting three particularly significant opportunities.\nNetflix has been dabbling in video games for some time now, but the company is beginning to see greater interest from its audience for the games based on the company's growing library of intellectual property. Management is particularly excited about the title based on Squid Game, the company's most-watched series.\nManagement is also leaning into its recent successes with live events. Netflix is live-streaming a boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul on Nov. 15. The company also has exclusive rights to two NFL games on Christmas Day: The Super Bowl LVII-winning Kansas City Chiefs vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Baltimore Ravens vs. the Houston Texans. Finally, Netflix is the new home of WWE Raw, the highly rated wrestling entertainment show, with weekly episodes beginning in January 2025.\nHowever, the company's biggest opportunity is its growing digital advertising business. Netflix noted during the call that its audience and ad inventory are currently growing faster than the company's ability to capitalize on that growth. Members signing up for the lowest-priced ad tier increased 35% quarter over quarter and accounted for 50% of new members in the countries where Netflix shows advertising.\nThe company has a couple of important initiatives that are designed to accelerate its ads business. First, Netflix is launching its first-party ad server, beginning in Canada this quarter, then in the rest of its advertising markets in 2025. The company is also leaning into its partnership with The Trade Desk to expand its advertising reach. Netflix noted that ad-tier members are similar to other subscribers in terms of hours watched and preferred titles, which shows viewing patterns are consistent. Management expects ad revenue to double (off a small base) in 2025.\nEach of these initiatives represents an incremental growth driver, which helps illustrate how Netflix plans to continue its robust growth.\nNetflix currently has a market cap of $323 billion, which means it will take stock price gains of roughly 207% to drive its value to $1 trillion, but there's a clear path for growth over the coming decade. According to Wall Street, Netflix is expected to generate revenue of $38.74 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 8. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Netflix would have to grow its revenue to roughly $357 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nWall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth for Netflix of about 26% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $1 trillion market cap as soon as 2035. It's worth noting that Netflix has grown its annual revenue by 562% over the past decade, and its net income has soared 1,450%, so Wall Street's outlook could well be conservative. Furthermore, as this quarter illustrates, Netflix has a habit of outpacing Wall Street's expectations, which could also shave years off this timeline.\nFinally, Netflix is currently selling for roughly 39 times earnings, which might seem expensive at first glance, but consider this: Wall Street expects Netflix to generate EPS of $23.11 in 2025, which would represent a multiple of 30 -- the same as the S&P 500. Considering Netflix's strong track record of growth and its significant opportunity, I'd say that's a fair price to pay for a company expected to generate consistent double-digit growth over the next five years.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Title": "Hyperscale Cloud Market Forecast Report 2024, with Leading Player Coverage for Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google Cloud Platform), Alibaba, Oracle, IBM, Apple, Fujitsu, Broadcom and Salesforce",
        "Author": "  Research and Markets ",
        "Text": "Dublin, Oct. 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Hyperscale Cloud Market: Analysis By Application, By Enterprise Size, By End-User, By Region Size and Trends and Forecast up to 2029\" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\nIn 2023, the global hyperscale cloud market was valued at US$320.59 billion and is expected to grow to US$1.44 trillion by 2029.Some of the reasons companies are switching to hyperscale cloud computing are speed, reduced downtime losses, easier management, easier transition into the cloud, scalability based on demand, etc. On the other hand, the adoption of industry clouds is expected to significantly increase the IT total addressable market (TAM) in the forthcoming years with the three leading hyperscalers taking a huge share due to their capabilities in data analysis and artificial intelligence. The hyperscale cloud market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 28.92% during the forecast period of 2024-2029.\nMarket Segmentation Analysis:\nBy Application: The cloud computing segment held the highest share of the market, whereas big data analytics segment is expected to be the fastest-growing segment in the forecasted period. The demand for hyperscale cloud in cloud computing is surging due to the growing need for scalable, efficient, and cost-effective infrastructure. Businesses of all sizes, from startups to large enterprises, are increasingly migrating their operations to the cloud to enhance agility, reduce capital expenditure, and optimize IT management.Hyperscale cloud infrastructure provides the ability to handle massive workloads and scale resources dynamically, making it ideal for businesses with fluctuating demand. On the other hand, demand for hyperscale in big data analytics segment would grow as businesses are increasingly using advanced analytics, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, to analyze customer behavior, optimize operations, and predict trends. Hyperscale clouds enable these organizations to process and analyze terabytes or even petabytes of data in real time, offering the scalability needed to accommodate growing datasets without significant upfront investments in physical infrastructure.By Enterprise Size: The large enterprise segment held the highest share of the market, whereas small and medium sized enterprises segment is expected to be the fastest-growing segment in the forecasted period. The demand for hyperscale cloud solutions is increasing among large enterprises due to their need for massive computational power, vast storage capacities, and advanced security features.Large enterprises often operate across multiple regions and industries, requiring cloud infrastructure that can handle complex, global-scale operations with high availability and performance. Hyperscale cloud platforms provide the scalability to manage enormous workloads, enabling these enterprises to scale up or down based on fluctuating demands without the need for significant investments in physical infrastructure. Whereas, the demand for hyperscale cloud among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is increasing due to the accessibility, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness it offers. Unlike large enterprises, SMEs typically have limited budgets and IT resources, making it impractical to invest heavily in their own physical infrastructure. Hyperscale cloud providers offer pay-as-you-go models, allowing SMEs to leverage enterprise-level infrastructure without the need for upfront capital investment.By End-User: In 2023, the BFSI segment led the hyperscale cloud market, owing to the increasing number of banking applications, which has resulted in the exponential growth of data in the banking and financial services industry. The manufacturing hyperscale cloud market is expected to grow at the highest CAGR. The scope for scaling operations up and down via the cloud enables manufacturing companies to mitigate market demand volatility.
