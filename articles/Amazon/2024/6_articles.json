        "Author": " Alexandra Canal    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) entered the ad-supported streaming space in January by defaulting all of its Prime Video subscriptions to ads. Just six months later, the tech giant's impact is already being felt.\nPrime Video subscriptions now automatically default to the ad-supported tier at current monthly rates of $14.99 for Prime delivery members and $8.99 for non-Prime members\u2014or those who only subscribe to the standalone video service. Subscribers who want the ad-free version will now see their monthly bill go up by $3 a month.\nAmazon's entrance builds on the presence of Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS), which introduced their respective ad tiers in late 2022. That means an already accelerated expansion of ad-supported options for consumers \u2014 along with prospective ad buyers.\n\"There's no question it has created an excess of supply in the marketplace,\" Rita Ferro, Disney's president of global advertising, told Yahoo Finance earlier this week at Cannes Lions, an annual event for the global advertising and communications industry.\nBottom line: companies like Disney must work that much harder to lure advertisers to their platforms.\nMoffettNathanson estimated Prime Video could add over 50 billion impressions to the connected TV (CTV) market this year, \"an amount that is likely to dwarf a lot of the smaller players in the space\" as increased inventory simultaneously drives down the price for ads.\n\"Amazon knows how to gain market share and they know how to use price to gain market share,\" said Mark Douglas, CEO at MNTN, an ad tech company that specializes in the CTV space. \"That's one of the big things this week [at Cannes] \u2014 Amazon is being pretty aggressive in terms of lowering price.\"\nAd buyers have paid Amazon a reported cost per thousand, or CPM rate, between $30 and $35. The low price has forced competitors to follow suit. Netflix dropped its CPM rate from a previous $39 to $45 range last summer to roughly $29 to $35 currently, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\"Why they can do that and the rest of the industry considers that a problem is because Amazon has [a] big search advertising business and they can bring those advertisers over into Prime,\" Douglas said. \"They can monetize the content way better and bring down the price. That is the main dynamic at work right now.\"\nAmazon has one of the broadest audience reaches of all the streaming platforms due to its Prime delivery service and ability to keep consumers within its ecosystem. That's helped the company easily secure customer data and increase its targeting capabilities \u2014 both attractive to advertisers.\n\"It just raises the stakes,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen previously told Yahoo Finance when asked about Amazon's ads rollout. \"Everybody now faces another competitor and a very large supply of inventory that they're going to be competing for.\"\nBut there might be enough inventory to go around, especially as more consumers opt for ad-supported streaming options.\nAccording to subscription analytics platform Antenna, which released its second quarter \"State of Subscriptions\" report on June 13, more users are selecting cheaper ad plans, with 38% of overall accounts now choosing ad tiers.\nThose trends have continued to encourage the shift of ad buyers from linear to streaming, with MoffettNathanson predicting total advertising video on demand will grow 33% this year, compared with a 17% increase in 2023.\n\"Platforms with the most inventory, least must-have content, and worst targeting capabilities are most at risk,\" the firm said.\nBut Douglas believes competitiveness will force the rest of the industry to adapt to Amazon's moves.\n\"There's a transformation underway,\" the executive said, explaining Amazon and other Big Tech companies concentrate on capturing overall market share rather than securing the highest price for a 30-second ad, the prior standard for traditional media buying.\n\"The rest of the industry is not set up for that. That's the problem,\" he said. \"Still, I actually don't think it's some big long-term threat where Amazon is going to eat everyone's lunch. In the near term it's accelerating trends that needed to happen anyway.\"\nBut, he cautioned, \"it's going to take thinking a little more like a tech company and a little less like a media company.\"\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has lost 0.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +61.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.58 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +57.9%. This estimate has changed +1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.80 indicates a change of +26.6% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $148.54 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.5%. The $638.24 billion and $709.87 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11% and +11.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAmazon reported revenues of $143.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.5%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $0.31 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $142.53 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +36.14%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) climbed higher on Tuesday, adding as much as 4.5%. As of 2:10 p.m. ET, the stock was up 4.1%.\nThere were a couple of catalysts that sent the e-commerce titan higher. One was a bullish take from a Wall Street analyst; the other was the unexpected gain on one of its investments.\nAnalysts at Bank of America said that Amazon remains their top pick among large-cap and FAANG stocks in 2024, according to online investment publication The Fly. The analysts maintained their buy rating on the stock while raising their price target to $220, up from $210. This suggests potential gains for investors of 18%, compared to Tuesday's closing price.\nThe analysts noted that Amazon has significant potential for efficiency improvements this year. Despite progress made in 2023, Amazon remains below 2018 levels when measured using a number of logistics-utilization metrics the investment bank tracks. While a rebound in digital retail has been the primary driver so far this year, margin expansion could provide the next leg higher.\nThe other catalyst driving Amazon higher today was the company's investment in Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN). Amazon owns more than 162 million shares of Rivian stock, amounting to a 16.4% stake. The electric-vehicle (EV) maker has been weighed down by results that weren't as good as Wall Street predicted and a general slowing in the EV market. As a result, Rivian stock was recently down as much as 69% from its all-time high reached late last year.\nHowever, Rivian announced it would form a new joint venture with Volkswagen AG, including an investment of up to $5 billion. Rivian stock vaulted more than 20% higher on the news (as of this writing), which boosted the value of Amazon's stake in the company by roughly $415 million.\nAmazon stock has been on fire, up more than 50% over the past year. Investors have been bullish on the rebound in online retail, the company's foray into artificial intelligence (AI), and a resurgence in its cloud growth.\nAt less than 3x forward sales, Amazon is attractively priced, particularly when viewed in the light of its multiple growth drivers.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list titled\u00a010 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI \u201cValue Creation Opportunity\u201d. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nUBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s (GWM) recently\u00a0published\u00a0a detailed report discussing different layers of the AI \u201cvalue chain,\u201d estimating the combined market value opportunity from the layers at $1.2 trillion by 2027.\nUBS segments the AI market into three layers \u2013\u00a0 Enabling Layer, Intelligence Layer and Application Layer. The enabling layer is what actually powers the AI ecosystem \u2014 infrastructure, GPUs, data centers, Cloud, servers. UBS further divided this layer into two segments,\u00a0 Infrastructure and Cloud. The firm expects a combined $516 billion revenue opportunity from the enabling layer by 2027.\nNext up is the intelligence layer, which acts as the brain of the entire AI ecosystem. Large language models and backed software systems sit at this layer. UBS estimates that this layer presents a $225 billion opportunity by 2027.\nThe third layer in the AI market highlighted by UBS is the application layer. This is where the end user comes in. Cloud, data centers, GPUs, LLMs and algorithms amount to nothing if the end user cannot benefit from their huge processing power. UBS said estimating monetization opportunity of this layer was the hardest since it\u2019s still in its very early stage. The application layer addresses actual AI software used by customers \u2014 think AI assistants, GitHub CoPilot, marketing, customer service software, etc. UBS expects a whopping $395 billion in revenue opportunities for the application layer by 2027.\nKey AI Predictions\nThe UBS report also made key \u201cpredictions\u201d about the AI landscape. The firm\u2019s analysts believe the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) could give rise to a \u201ccapex cycle\u201d that could \u201cinflate\u201d the AI investment bubble. UBS sees the dominance of a few companies in the AI industry will continue to be a reality moving forward, as it expects \u201cmonolithic players\u201d and \u201cAI foundries\u201d prevailing in the near future.\nBased on this report, let\u2019s take a look at the top companies that will directly benefit from this $1.16 trillion opportunity by 2027. For this article we analyzed UBS analysis and picked 10 stocks that are directly exposed to the three layers in the AI ecosystem highlighted by UBS in its latest report. These companies are positioned extremely well to benefit from the monetization opportunities in the enabling, intelligence and application layers of the AI market. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nchristian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0doesn\u2019t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled \u201cchatbot recommendations\u201d as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0strength in the application layer of AI.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon\u2019s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack \u2013 infrastructure with NVIDIA\u2019s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI \u201cValue Creation Opportunity\u201d. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Amazon (Nasdsq: AMZN) stock has long been a darling of tech sector investors. Even when the share price dropped by almost half in 2022, investors still buy it. Right now, it sits at number 5 on the market cap leaderboard, with a total capitalization of $1.902T.\nFor You: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t Sell\nTry This: 6 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money (That Actually Work)\nIf you already own Amazon or are thinking of buying, the obvious question is, what lies ahead? How much will your Amazon shares be worth in 5 years? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\nWealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.\nLike many tech companies, Amazon\u2019s rise has not been a straight line. The company sort of bumped along from its IPO in 1997 through 2015. At that point, the stock took off, going from a split-adjusted price of $15.63 in January 2015 to $159.03 in August 2020, as Amazon became the supplier of choice for just about everything during the height of the pandemic.\nAs pandemic restrictions began to lift and in-person shopping again became possible, Amazon stock took a deep dive, to $85.46 in January 2023. But the investment bounced back and, in recent weeks, has eclipsed its previous high to close at $182.81 on June 18, 2024.\nAmazon stock has split four times in its lifetime. In 1998, the stock split 2-for-1, so the number of outstanding shares doubled, and this price was cut in half. In January 1999, it split again, this time 3-for-1. There was a second split in September 1999, also 2-for-1. In 2022, Amazon stock split again, this time 20-for-1. If you purchased one share of Amazon before June 2, 1998, you would have 240 shares today.\nAmazon stock sold June 1, 1998, at $85.68 per share. The stock closed at $182.81 on June 18, 2024. So, that one share you bought at $85.68 26 years ago would now be 240 shares at $182.81, or a total of $43,874.40.\nAmazon\u2019s average one-year price target is $224.17, but at least one analyst predicts it will go to $500.00 per share in just 12 months. Of the 47 analysts who recommended Amazon in June, 44 rated it a buy or a strong buy.\nForecasters predict that Amazon will reach $200 per share a year from now and will continue to rise to $250 per share at the end of 2026. In 2027, the prediction is for a price of $300, and $250 by the end of 2028.\nMuch of Amazon\u2019s future success, like that of many tech companies, will depend on the trajectory of AI. Amazon\u2019s Web Services (AWS) continues to benefit from AI development and adoption, so if the potential of AI is realized in the coming years, Amazon could see a big benefit. That said, there are other tech companies that are also positioned to capitalize on this trend.\nAs with any investment, it\u2019s impossible to see into the future. However, the experts think that Amazon\u2019s stock will continue to climb.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Car Brands With the Most Reliable Engines\nI'm a Bank Teller: 4 Reasons You Should Withdraw Your Savings Right Now\n5 Moves Every Woman Should Consider Before Retirement\nThis is The Single Most Overlooked Tool for Becoming Debt-Free\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How Much Will Your Amazon Shares Be Worth in 5 Years?

        "Title": "How Amazon blew Alexa\u2019s shot to dominate AI, according to more than a dozen employees who worked on it",
        "Author": "  Sharon Goldman ",
        "Text": "\u201cAlexa, let\u2019s chat.\u201d\nWith that phrase, David Limp, at the time Amazon's (AMZN) head of devices and services, showed off a new generative AI-powered version of the company\u2019s signature Alexa voice assistant in September 2023.\nAt a packed event at the Seattle-based tech giant\u2019s lavish second headquarters in the Washington DC suburbs, Limp demonstrated the new Alexa for a room full of reporters and cheering employees. He showed how in response to the new trigger phrase, \u201cAlexa, let\u2019s chat,\u201d the digital assistant responded in a far more natural and conversational voice than the friendly-but-robotic one that hundreds of millions have become accustomed to communicating with for weather updates, reminders, timers and music requests.\nLimp asked Alexa how his favorite football team\u2014Vanderbilt University\u2014was doing. Alexa showed how it could respond in a joyful voice, and how it could write a message to his friends to remind them to watch the upcoming Vanderbilt football game and send it to his phone.\nThe new Alexa LLM, the company said, would soon be available as a free preview on Alexa-powered devices in the US. Rohit Prasad, Amazon\u2019s SVP and Alexa leader said the news marked a \u201cmassive transformation of the assistant we love,\u201d and called the new Alexa a \u201csuper agent.\u201d It was clear the company wanted to refute perceptions that the existing Alexa lacked smarts. (Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly called it \u201cdumb as a rock\u201d in March 2023 as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT rocketed to fame).\nBut after the event, there was radio silence\u2014or digital assistant silence, as the case may be. The traditional Alexa voice never changed on the half-a-billion devices that have been sold globally, and little news emerged over the coming months about the new generative AI Alexa, other than recent reports about a potential launch later this year that could include a subscription charge.\nThe reason, according to interviews with more than a dozen former employees who worked on AI for Alexa, is an organization beset by structural dysfunction and technological challenges that have repeatedly delayed shipment of the new generative AI-powered Alexa. Overall, the former employees paint a picture of a company desperately behind its Big Tech rivals Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) in the race to launch AI chatbots and agents, and floundering in its efforts to catch up.\nThe September 2023 demo, the former employees emphasize, was just that\u2014a demo. The new Alexa was not ready for a prime time rollout, and still isn\u2019t. The Alexa large language model (LLM), that sits at the heart of the new Alexa, and which Amazon positioned as taking on OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, is, according to former employees, far from state-of-the-art. Research scientists who worked on the LLM said Amazon does not have enough data or access to the specialized computer chips needed to run LLMs to compete with rival efforts at companies like OpenAI.\nAmazon has also, former employees say, repeatedly deprioritized the new Alexa in favor of building generative AI for Amazon\u2019s cloud computing unit, AWS. And while Amazon has built a partnership and invested $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic, whose LLM model Claude is considered competitive with OpenAI\u2019s models, it has been unable to capitalize on that relationship to build a better Alexa. Privacy concerns have kept Alexa\u2019s teams from using Anthropic\u2019s Claude model, former employees say\u2014but so too have Amazon\u2019s ego-driven internal politics.\nAn Amazon spokesperson said details provided by the former research scientists for this story were \"dated\" \u2014even though many of these sources left the company in the past six months\u2014and did not reflect the current state of the Alexa LLM.\nShe added that the company has access to hundreds of thousands of GPUs and other AI-specific chips. She also disputed the idea that Alexa has been deprioritized or that Anthropic\u2019s Claude has been off-limits due to privacy concerns, but she declined to provide evidence of how Claude is being used in the new Alexa.\nWhile aspects of Amazon\u2019s struggle to update Alexa are unique, the company\u2019s challenges give an indication of how difficult it is for companies to revamp digital assistants built on older technologies to incorporate generative AI.\nApple, too, has faced similar struggles to integrate AI into its products, including its digital assistant Siri. Siri and Alexa share a similar technological pedigree\u2014in fact, Siri debuted three years prior to Alexa, in October 2011. And like Amazon, Apple underinvested in the kind of AI expertise needed to build the massive language models that underpin today\u2019s generative AI, and in the vast clusters of graphics processing units (GPUs), the specialized computer chips such models require. Apple too, like Amazon, has launched a determined, but belated, effort to catch up.\nApple took some big steps towards regaining lost ground in the generative AI race with a set of highly-anticipated announcements at its WWDC conference earlier this week. The debut included a big upgrade for Siri, including a more natural-sounding voice and the potential for \u201con-screen awareness,\u201d which will eventually allow Siri to take more agent-like actions across apps. Apple also announced a Siri integration with ChatGPT. Apple\u2019s announcements only up the pressure on Amazon to deliver the new Alexa.\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s growing evidence that Amazon is ill-prepared for this renewed battle of the digital assistants\u2014even though many assumed the company would have been perfectly positioned to take Alexa into the generative AI age.\n\"Alexa AI was riddled with technical and bureaucratic problems.\u201dMihail Eric, a former senior machine learning scientist at Alexa AI\nMihail Eric, a former senior machine learning scientist at Alexa AI, took to X (formerly Twitter) to say just that: In a post titled \u201cHow Alexa dropped the ball on being the top conversational system on the planet,\u201d Eric, who left Amazon in July 2021, pointed out that Alexa had sold over 500 million devices, \u201cwhich is a mind-boggling user data moat,\u201d and that \u201cwe had all the resources, talent, and momentum to become the unequivocal market leader in conversational AI.\u201d But most of that tech never saw the light of day, he said, because Alexa AI \u201cwas riddled with technical and bureaucratic problems.\u201d\nThe dozen former employees Fortune spoke to over the past month echo Eric\u2019s account and add further details to the story of how the Everything Company has failed to do this one thing. The former employees spoke anonymously to avoid violating non-disclosure agreements or non-disparagement clauses they had signed.\nWell before ChatGPT wowed the world in November 2022, there was Amazon\u2019s Alexa. The digital assistant was launched in 2014 alongside the Echo smart speaker that served as its hardware interface. The digital assistant, Amazon said, had been inspired by the all-knowing computer featured on Star Trek (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is a big Star Trek fan). The product quickly became a hit with consumers, selling over 20 million devices by 2017.\nBut Alexa was not built on the same AI models and methods that made ChatGPT groundbreaking. Instead, it was a collection of small machine learning models and thousands of hand-crafted and hard-coded rules that turned a user\u2019s utterances into the actions Alexa performed.\nAmazon had been experimenting with some early large language models\u2014all of them much smaller than GPT-3 and GPT-4, the two models OpenAI would use to power ChatGPT\u2014but these were nowhere near ready for deployment in a product. The company was caught flat-footed by the generative AI boom that followed ChatGPT\u2019s late November 2022 launch, former employees say.\nA frantic, frenetic few months followed as Amazon\u2019s Alexa organization struggled to coalesce around a vision to take the digital assistant from a stilted command-action bot to a truly conversational, helpful agent. Non-generative AI projects were deprioritized overnight, and throughout the 2022 Christmas period executives urged Amazon\u2019s scientists, engineers and product managers to figure out how to ensure Amazon had generative AI products to offer customers. One former Alexa AI project manager described the atmosphere at the company as \u201ca bit panicked.\u201d\n\"The leaders internally clearly had big plans, but they didn't really know what they were getting into.\u201dFormer intern on Alexa team\nAmazon\u2019s response almost immediately ran into trouble, as various teams within Alexa and AWS failed to coalesce around a unified plan.\nMany employees were still working remotely following the Covid pandemic, leading to people being endlessly \u201chuddled on conference calls debating the minutiae of strategic PRFAQs\u201d (Amazon-speak for \u200b\u200ba written document used when proposing a product idea in its early stages), the Alexa AI project manager said. The company struggled, he said, to \u201cshift from peacetime to wartime mode.\u201d\nOne senior Alexa data scientist said this was especially frustrating because he had tried to sound the alarm on the coming wave of generative AI as far back as mid-2022, gathering data to show his director-level leadership, but he said he could not convince them that the company needed to change its AI strategy. Only after ChatGPT launched did the company swing into action, he explained.\nThe problem is, as hundreds of millions are aware from their stilted discourse with Alexa, the assistant was not built for, and has never been primarily used for, back-and-forth conversations. Instead, it always focused on what the Alexa organization calls \u201cutterances\u201d \u2014 the questions and commands like \u201cwhat\u2019s the weather?\u201d or \u201cturn on the lights\u201d that people bark at Alexa.\nIn the first months after ChatGPT launched, it was not clear LLMs would be able to trigger these real-world actions from a natural conversation, one Ph.D. research scientist who interned on the Alexa team during this period said.\n\u201cThe idea that an LLM could \u2018switch on the lights\u2019 when you said \u2018I can\u2019t see, turn it all on\u2019 was not proven yet,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the leaders internally clearly had big plans, but they didn't really know what they were getting into.\u201d (It is now widely accepted that LLMs can, at least in theory, be coupled with other technology to control digital tools.)\nInstead, teams were figuring out how to implement generative AI on the fly. That included creating synthetic datasets\u2014in this case, collections of computer-generated dialogues with a chatbot\u2014that they could use to train an LLM. Those building AI models often use synthetic data when there isn\u2019t enough real-world data to improve AI accuracy, or when privacy protection is needed\u2014 and remember, most of what the Alexa team had were simple, declarative \u201cutterances.\u201d\n\u201c[Customers were] talking in Alexa language,\u201d one former Amazon machine learning scientist said. \u201cSo now imagine you want to encourage people to talk in language that has never happened\u2014so where are you going to get the data from to train the model? You have to create it, but that comes with a whole lot of hurdles because there\u2019s a gazillion ways people can say the same thing.\u201d\nAlso, while Alexa has been integrated with thousands of third-party devices and services, it turns out that LLMs are not terribly good at handling such integrations.\nAccording to a former Alexa machine learning manager, who worked on Alexa\u2019s smart home capabilities, even OpenAI\u2019s latest GPT 4o model, or the newest Google Gemini model\u2014which both are able to use voice, rather than just text\u2014struggle to go from spoken dialogue to performing a task using other software. That requires what is known as an API call and LLMs don\u2019t do this well yet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not consistent enough, it hallucinates, gets things wrong. It\u2019s hard to build an experience when you\u2019re connecting to many different devices,\u201d the former machine learning scientist said.\nAs spring gave way to the summer of 2023, many in Alexa\u2019s rank and file remained in the dark about how the digital assistant would meet the generative AI moment. The project lacked vision, former employees said. \u201cI remember my team and myself complaining a lot to our superiors that it wasn't transparent what the vision looks like\u2014it wasn't transparent what exactly we're trying to launch,\u201d one said.\nAnother former manager said the new Alexa LLM was talked about in the months prior to the September demo, but it wasn\u2019t clear what it would mean. \u201cWe were just hearing things like, \u2018Oh yeah, this is coming,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut we had no idea what it was or what it would look like.\u201d\nThe September 2023 Alexa demo made it seem like a widespread rollout of the new Alexa LLM was imminent. But the new language model-based Alexa ultimately \u201cdidn't meet the go/no-go criteria,\u201d one former employee said. LLMs are known for producing hallucinations and sometimes toxic content, and Amazon\u2019s was no different, making broad release risky.\nThis, former employees say, is the reason Alexa\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Chat\u201d feature has never made it into wide release. \u201cIt's very hard to make AI safe enough and test all aspects of that black box in order to release it,\u201d a former manager said.\nThe September 2023 demo, he pointed out, involved different functionality than what Alexa was best known for\u2014 that is, taking a command and executing it. Ensuring Alexa could still perform these old functions while also enabling the conversational dialogue the new Alexa promised would be no easy task.\nThe manager said it was increasingly clear to him that the organization would, at least temporarily, need to maintain two completely different technology stacks\u2014one supporting Alexa\u2019s old features and another the new ones.\nBut managers did not want to entertain that idea, he said. Instead, the message at the company at the time he was laid off in November 2023 was still \u201cwe need to basically burn the bridge with the old Alexa AI model and pivot to only working on the new one.\u201d\nEven as the new Alexa LLM rollout floundered, Amazon executives set ever more lofty generative AI goals. Right before the demo, Prasad, the Amazon SVP who had served as Alexa\u2019s head scientist, was promoted to a new role designed to bring the company\u2019s disparate research teams under a single umbrella, with a goal to develop human-level artificial general intelligence, or AGI.\nThe move put Amazon in direct competition with companies like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, which have the creation of AGI as their founding mission. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also recently said that creating AGI is his company\u2019s mission too.\nBy November 2023, there was word that Amazon was investing millions in training an AI model, codenamed Olympus, that would have 2 trillion parameters\u2014or tunable variables. Parameters are a rough approximation of a model\u2019s size and complexity. And Olympus\u2019s reported parameter count would make it double the reported size of OpenAI\u2019s most capable model, GPT-4.\nThe former research scientist working on the Alexa LLM said Project Olympus is \u201ca joke,\u201d adding that the largest model in progress is 470 billion parameters. He also emphasized that the current Alexa LLM version is unchanged from the 100 billion-parameter model that was used for the September 2023 demo, but has had more pretraining and fine tuning done on it to improve it. (To be sure, 100 billion parameters is still a relatively powerful model. Meta\u2019s Llama 3, as a comparison, weighs in at 70 billion parameters).\nIn the months following the September 2023 demo, a former research scientist who worked on building the new Alexa LLM recalled how Alexa leadership, including Amazon\u2019s generative AI leader Rohit Prasad, pushed the team to work harder and harder. The message was to \"get some magic\" out of the LLM, the research scientist said. But the magic never happened. A lack of adequate data was one of the main reasons why, former employees said.\nMeta\u2019s Llama 3 was pre-trained on 15 trillion tokens, the smallest unit of data that an LLM processes. The Alexa LLM has only been trained on 3 trillion. (Unlike parameters, which are the number of tunable settings that a model has, a token is the small unit of data\u2014such as a word\u2014that the model processes during training).\nMeanwhile, \u201cfine-tuning\u201d an AI model\u2014which takes a pre-trained model and further hones it for specific tasks\u2014also benefits from larger datasets than what Amazon has at the ready. Meta\u2019s Llama 3 model was fine-tuned on 10 million data points. The LLM built by Amazon\u2019s AGI organization has so far accumulated only around 1 million, with only 500,000 high-quality data points, the former Alexa LLM research scientist said.\nOne of the many reasons for that, he explained, is that Amazon insists on using its own data annotators (people responsible for labeling data so that AI models can recognize patterns) and that organization is very slow. \"So we can never never get high quality data from them after several rounds, even after one year of developing the model,\u201d he said.\nBeyond a paucity of data, the Alexa team also lacks access to the vast quantities of the latest Nvidia GPUs, the specialized chips used to train and run AI models, that the teams at OpenAI, Meta, and Google have, two sources told Fortune. \"Most of the GPUs are still A100, not H100,\" the former Alexa LLM research scientist added, referring to the most powerful GPU Nvidia currently has available.\nAt times, building the new Alexa has taken a backseat to other generative AI priorities at Amazon, they said. Amazon\u2019s main focus after ChatGPT launched was to roll out Bedrock, a new AWS cloud computing service that allowed customers to build generative AI chatbots and other applications in the cloud\u2014which was announced in April 2023 and made generally available in September. AWS is a critical profit-driver for Amazon.\nAlexa, on the other hand, is a cost center\u2014the division reportedly loses billions each year\u2014and is mostly viewed as a way to keep customers engaged with Amazon and as a way to gather data that can help Amazon and its partners better target advertising.\n\u201cIt's simply inaccurate to state Amazon Q is a higher priority than Alexa.\u201dAmazon spokesperson\nThe LLM that Amazon scientists are building (a version of which will also power Alexa) is also first being rolled out to AWS\u2019 business-focused generative AI assistant Amazon Q, said a former Alexa LLM scientist who left within the past few months, because the model is now considered good enough for specific enterprise use cases. Amazon Q also taps Anthropic\u2019s Claude AI model. But Alexa\u2019s LLM team has not been allowed to use Claude due to concerns about data privacy.\nAmazon\u2019s spokesperson said the assertion about Claude and privacy is false, and disputed other details about Amazon\u2019s LLM effort that Fortune heard from multiple sources. \u201cIt's simply inaccurate to state Amazon Q is a higher priority than Alexa. It\u2019s also incorrect to state that we\u2019re using the same LLM for Q and Alexa.\u201d\nOne former Alexa AI employee who has hired several employees who had been working on the new Alexa LLM said that most have mentioned \u201cfeeling exhausted\u201d by the constant pressure to ready the model for a launch that is repeatedly postponed\u2014and frustrated because other work is on hold until in the meantime. A few have also conveyed a growing skepticism as to whether the overall design of the LLM-based Alexa even makes sense, he added.\n\"One story I heard was that early in the project, there was a big push from senior executives who had become overconfident after experimenting with ChatGPT, and that this overconfidence has persisted among some senior leaders who continue to drive toward an unrealistic-feeling goal,\u201d he said.\nAnother former Alexa LLM scientist said managers set unachievable deadlines. \u201cEvery time the managers assigned us a task related to [the] LLM, they requested us to complete it within a very short period of time (e.g., 2 days, one week), which is impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems the leadership doesn't know anything about LLMs\u2014they don't know how many people they need and what should be the expected time to complete each task for building a successful product like ChatGPT.\u201d\nAlexa never aligned with Jeff Bezos\u2019 idea of \u201ctwo-pizza teams\u201d\u2014that is, that teams should ideally be small enough that you could cater a full team meeting with just two pizzas. Bezos thought smaller teams drove effective decision-making and collaboration. Instead, Alexa has historically been\u2014and remains, for the most part\u2014a giant division. Prior to the most recent layoffs, it had 10,000 employees.\nAnd while it has fewer now, it is still organized into large, siloed domains such as Alexa Home, Alexa Entertainment, Alexa Music and Alexa Shopping, each with hundreds of employees, along with directors and a VP at the top.\nAs pressure grew for each domain to work with the new Alexa LLM to craft generative AI features, each of which required accuracy benchmarks, the domains came into conflict, with sometimes counterproductive results, sources said.\nFor instance, a machine learning scientist working on Alexa Home recalled that while his domain was working on ways for Alexa to help users control their lights or the thermostat, the Music domain was busy working on how to get Alexa to understand very specific requests like \u201cplay Rihanna, then Tupac, and then pause 30 minutes and then play DMX.\u201d\nEach domain team had to build its own relationship with the central Alexa LLM team. \u201cWe spent months working with those LLM guys just to understand their structure and what data we could give them to fine-tune the model to make it work.\u201d Each team wanted to fine-tune the AI model for its own domain goals.\nBut as it turned out, if the Home team tried to fine-tuned the Alexa LLM to make it more capable for Home questions, and then the Music team came along and fine-tuned it using their own data for Music, the model would wind up performing worse. \u201cCatastrophic forgetting,\u201d where what a model learns later in training degrades its ability to perform well on tasks it encountered earlier in training is a problem with all deep learning models.\n\u201cAs it gets better in Music, [the model] can get less smart at Home,\u201d the machine learning scientist said. \u201cSo finding the sweet spot where you\u2019re trying to fine tune for 12 domains is almost a lottery.\u201d\nThese days, he added, LLM scientists know that fine tuning may not be the best technique for creating a model with both rich capabilities and flexibility\u2014there are others, like prompt engineering, that can do better. But by then, many months had gone by with little progress to show for it.\nEach Alexa domain, with its own leadership, wanted to protect and expand its fiefdom, one former product manager said. \"This organization has just turned out into something like a mafia,\u201d she said. \u201cLet's say, if I work for you, I'm just taking orders because it is in my best interest to agree with you. It is my best interest to not get chopped off in the next layoff\u2014it's quite ruthless. It's in my best interest because you're going to help me build my empire.\u201d\nAmazon insists it is fully committed to delivering a generative AI Alexa, adding that its vision remains to build the \u201cworld\u2019s best personal assistant.\u201d An Amazon representative pointed out that over half a billion Alexa-enabled devices have been sold, and customers interact with Alexa tens of millions of times every hour.\nShe added that the implementation of generative AI comes with \u201chuge responsibility\u2014the details really matter\u201d with a technical implementation of this scale, on a device that millions of customers have welcomed into their home. While the Alexa LLM \u201cLet\u2019s chat\u201d feature has not been rolled out to the general public, it has been tested on small groups of customers \u201con an ongoing basis.\u201d\nBut many of the employees Fortune spoke to said they left in part because they despaired that the new Alexa would ever be ready\u2014or that by the time it is, it will have been overtaken by products launched by nimbler competitors, such as OpenAI. Those companies don\u2019t have to navigate an existing tech stack and defend an existing feature set.\nThe former employee who has hired several who left the Alexa organization over the past year said many were pessimistic about the Alexa LLM launch. \u201cThey just didn't see that it was actually going to happen,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s possible, say some of the employees Fortune interviewed, that Amazon will finally launch an LLM-based Alexa \u2014 and that it will be an improvement to today\u2019s Alexa. After all, there are hundreds of millions of Alexa users out there in the world who would certainly be happy if the device sitting on their desk or kitchen counter could do more than execute simple commands.\nBut given the challenges weighing down the Alexa LLM effort, and the gap separating it from the offerings of generative AI leaders like OpenAI and Google, none of the sources Fortune spoke with believe Alexa is close to accomplishing Amazon\u2019s mission of being \u201cthe world\u2019s best personal assistant,\u201d let alone Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019 vision of creating a real-life version of the helpful Star Trek computer. Instead, Amazon\u2019s Alexa runs the risk of becoming a digital relic with a cautionary tale\u2014 that of a potentially game-changing technology that got stuck playing the wrong game.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "As hot as the markets have been this year, some tech stocks have been doing even better. Online retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is up 19% this year, outperforming the S&P 500, which has risen by 11%. Investors are bullish on Amazon again but it wasn't that long ago that the stock was nosediving, when its shares crashed by nearly 50% in 2022.\nPart of the problem then was that amid shaky economic conditions, Amazon's elevated price made it vulnerable to a steep sell-off. Well, Amazon's stock's is now trading at even higher levels than where it was at the start of 2022. With the business slowing and Amazon not being the growth machine it has been in the past, is the prudent move for investors to step away from the stock and wait for it to come down in price? Or should you invest in Amazon anyway?\nAmazon's business is continuing to grow, just not at such a fast pace anymore. During the first three months of the year, the company reported $143.3 billion in revenue, which was 13% more than in the same quarter least year. Even its once fast-growing cloud business, Amazon Web Services, reported relatively modest 17% growth during the period.\nWhen you consider Amazon's growth rate in the past, these numbers aren't terribly impressive. And Amazon expects its growth rate to slow even further -- to between 7% and 11% for the current quarter.\nThere is the potential in the long run for Amazon's growth rate to improve, especially due to artificial intelligence (AI). One example is the company's plan to upgrade its Alexa voice assistant and enhance it with generative AI features. Amazon will charge a subscription fee for the upgraded assistant, which has the potential to be a new source of revenue growth for the business. But it will be difficult to move the needle much given how significantly large the tech company's top line already is.\nAlthough it's great to see that Amazon's business is growing and looking for new opportunities amid some challenging economic conditions, the days of double-digit growth may no longer be the norm. And if the business has slowed, then it's arguably not worth as high of a premium anymore.\nIt hasn't been uncommon in the past for growth investors to pay a high premium for Amazon's stock. But at 50 times trailing earnings, it may be more difficult to justify such a high price for a business that may only be growing in single digits moving forward.\nCompared to the average tech stock in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, which trades at 35 times its trailing earnings, it's hard to make the case that Amazon's stock provides investors with good value right now.\nEven if you are to consider the future growth that analysts are estimating, the stock is trading at a price-to-earnings-growth, or PEG, of around 2, which is nowhere near the cutoff of what a cheap price for a growth stock is -- a PEG of 1.\nAmazon has a solid business, but with the stock trading at such elevated levels and the business growing at a fairly modest rate, that puts investors at risk. The stock could again be vulnerable to a sell-off if economic conditions worsen in the near future, so there isn't much, if any, margin of safety with the stock at its current valuation.\nEven if you're bullish on Amazon's stock in the long run, there may be better growth stocks to consider buying today. The risk is that at these levels, you would already be paying for a lot of future growth, and that can make generating a strong return from the stock much less likely. While Amazon has a good business, unless you're prepared to hang on for 10+ years, you may be better off holding off on buying the stock until its valuation comes down significantly, to perhaps a multiple of 40 times earnings or less.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Not many businesses dominate quite like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) does. The massive tech enterprise is currently valued at nearly $2 trillion. This huge figure comes from a rapidly rising share price, which has soared $1,000% in the past decade and 7,400% in the past 20 years.\nThis \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has rewarded its shareholders in remarkable fashion. However, investors might want to consider another e-commerce business that could be flying under the radar right now. It might even be a better buying opportunity than Amazon.\nI believe we should first take the time to appreciate Amazon. The company originally sold just books online during its founding in the 1990s. But now, virtually any item you can think of can be purchased on the popular website.\nThis wide reach has resulted in nearly 40% of all money spent online in the U.S. going through Amazon.com. That's a tremendous statistic. Even more telling, Amazon's online stores raked in $235 billion in net sales in the past 12 months.\nThe company relentlessly focuses on low prices and a wide selection. And if that wasn't enough to provide customers with a great shopping experience, Amazon's massive and developed logistics footprint enables fast and free shipping. It's hard to compete with this.\nBesides e-commerce, Amazon has a strong position in other categories, namely cloud computing, streaming entertainment, and digital advertising. It has multiple growth engines that can propel it.\nWhile Amazon deservedly gets a lot of the attention, investors need to get familiar with Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY). Its shares have been obliterated. They currently trade 80% below their peak price, reached in November 2021.\nEtsy operates an online marketplace that sells unique, handcrafted, and vintage goods. This specialization separates the business from Amazon's mass-market focus. In fact, a survey found that 83% of Etsy buyers found items on the site that they couldn't find anywhere else. Amazon is the elephant in the room in the e-commerce world, but at least Etsy finds a way to stand out.\nThis company possesses an economic moat, too. As of March 31, it had 96.4 million buyers and 9.1 million active sellers on the platform. This two-sided ecosystem creates powerful network effects. \nEtsy doesn't handle inventory itself, so it also doesn't need to invest in warehouses or delivery trucks. This makes it an asset-light operation that generates consistent profits. In the past five years, the company's operating margin has averaged an impressive 15.9%.\nAs I mentioned earlier, Etsy shares have gotten crushed. This is where the opportunity lies for investors. The stock trades at a dirt-cheap valuation. The current forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12.5 represents a 43% discount to the S&P 500. However, based on the factors discussed, one could easily argue that Etsy is an above-average business.\nThe challenge with buying shares right now, particularly when the company is struggling to drive meaningful growth, is that it's hard to know when the situation will improve. Gross merchandise sales in the first quarter of 2024 were down almost 4% year over year. Etsy could continue to struggle for a little while longer.\nHowever, for investors who have a time horizon of five years, this stock could work out nicely. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, online shopping only represents 15.9% of all retail sales in the U.S. On a global level, I'd suspect that proportion is a lot lower. This gives Etsy a favorable backdrop to achieve healthy, profitable growth over the long haul.\nOnce the company is on a better footing, I believe the valuation multiple will follow suit. This makes now a good time to buy the stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Etsy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Etsy wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "On Jun 26, Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s AMZN shares advanced 3.9% and breached the $2 trillion mark for the first time in its history. This development makes Amazon the first company in the Zacks Internet \u2013 Commerce sub-industry and the fifth company overall to cross the landmark valuation.\nOf these companies, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, both of which are valued at more than $3 trillion, are contesting to become the largest company in the world, with NVIDIA briefly surpassing Microsoft in recent sessions. Apple, too, is a $3 trillion company, while Google parent Alphabet is currently the only other company alongside Amazon in the $2-$3 trillion range.\nSeattle-based Jeff Bezos-led Amazon has had a fantastic year so far. As of Jun 26, its share price increased 27.4%. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but is expected to be upgraded in the coming months. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nIn May, the e-commerce giant reported first-quarter 2024 earnings of 98 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents and the year-ago earnings of 31 cents. Revenues grew 13% year over year to a record high of $143.3 billion and edged past the consensus estimate of $142.5 billion. New generative AI features in its cloud and e-commerce businesses drove its robust growth. In fact, AI optimism has been the single biggest factor that has been driving the revival in mega-cap tech stocks since the onset of 2023.\nAmazon expects revenues in the range of $144-$149 billion for second-quarter 2024, suggesting year-over-year growth of 7-11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $150.3 billion. Its expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 57.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has improved 11.7% over the past 60 days. The company has a VGM Score of A.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is currently the largest cloud services provider in the world, and Amazon has also invested in AI startups, looking to leverage the AI boom. In 2023, Amazon unveiled new custom-designed chips used in data centers. The generative AI boom is likely to increase demand for AWS as well as the company\u2019s AI-platform building tool\nWhile being undeniably pricey, Amazon presently trades at a 40.67 forward P/E ratio. The industry\u2019s forward earnings multiple, on the other hand, is 25.20. This entails that investors believe that the stock can generate more profits in the future.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Minal Zaheer ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other cloud computing stocks. You can also check out the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Under $10 here.\nCloud computing has changed the way we access and manage computing resources. The industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Market estimates suggest a jump from a size of $0.68 trillion in 2024 to a projected $1.44 trillion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%. This upward trend is expected to continue, with the market reaching a value of almost $2.5 trillion by 2032. These figures point towards a rising adoption and utilization of cloud solutions across various industries.\nThe growth in the industry is likely to be driven by a number of factors. One key factor is the growing recognition among large enterprises of the impact that cloud computing can have on their operations. In fact, an impressive 94% of companies across the globe have already adopted cloud computing solutions. This high rate of adoption is expected to have a remarkable economic impact, with forecasts showing that it could generate approximately $3 trillion in revenue by the year 2030.\nCurrently, North America and Europe are leading the way in cloud computing adoption, with Asia Pacific not far behind. North America holds the largest share of the global market at 41%. The region's early adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has played a key role in driving its cloud market growth.\nEven with stricter regulations around data privacy and security, the European markets are also displaying consistent growth in cloud adoption. Countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are leading the way in cloud adoption within specific industries. This suggests that European businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of cloud solutions while navigating a regulatory landscape that prioritizes data protection.\nThe Asia Pacific region is also currently experiencing a rise in cloud computing adoption. The market size rose to an estimated $32.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to be a significant contributor to the global cloud computing market in the coming years. This growth can be attributed to a large-scale shift towards digital business models across various industries in the region. The need for cost-effective solutions has fueled cloud adoption among small and medium businesses (SMBs). Approximately 78% of SMBs are currently using cloud services, with 39% of these businesses spending up to $600,000 per year on public cloud services.\nTo shortlist the best cloud computing stocks to buy now, we relied on Insider Monkey\u2019s extensive database of 920 hedge funds as of Q1 2024. We picked the cloud computing stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), known for its e-commerce dominance, has expanded far beyond online retail. This multinational technology company has a diverse portfolio that includes cloud computing, online advertising, artificial intelligence, and streaming services.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced a stellar first quarter in 2024, exceeding analyst expectations. Net sales rose 13% year-over-year to $143.3 billion, highlighting strong overall growth. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing arm, remained a key driver of this success.\nAWS revenue grew an impressive 17% year-over-year, reaching $25 billion. Operating income for AWS also jumped significantly, reaching $9.4 billion compared to $5.1 billion in Q1 2023. Profitability across the entire company improved markedly as well. Operating income grew to $15.3 billion from $4.8 billion in Q1 2023. This strong performance translated to a doubling of net income, reaching $10.4 billion ($0.98 per diluted share) compared to $3.2 billion ($0.31 per diluted share) in Q1 2023.\nAnalysts are bullish on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), assigning an average \"Strong Buy\" rating to the stock. The average 12-month price target for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) sits at $221.55, suggesting a potential upside of over 11% from the current price levels.\nHere\u2019s what Mar Vista Investment Partners, LLC said about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is experiencing a surge in profitability, reflected in significantly higher retail profit margins. Strategic cost reductions in headcount and fulfillment have materialized into financial gains. While the unexpected pandemic-driven demand surge necessitated a rapid expansion of fulfillment infrastructure, this initially impacted operating profits. However, current unit sales growth has effectively reached equilibrium with fulfillment capacity. This balance is leading to positive adjustments to both earnings and intrinsic value estimates. Should the economic climate continue to improve, we believe Amazon\u2019s investment potential aligns with its projected 15-20% intrinsic value growth trajectory.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best cloud computing stocks to buy.

While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "With 63% ownership of the shares, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Significantly high institutional ownership implies Amazon.com's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\nThe top 25 shareholders own 47% of the company\n 11% of Amazon.com is held by insiders\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 63% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Amazon.com.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\nAmazon.com already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amazon.com's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Amazon.com is not owned by hedge funds. Because actions speak louder than words, we consider it a good sign when insiders own a significant stake in a company. In Amazon.com's case, its Top Key Executive, Jeffrey Bezos, is the largest shareholder, holding 9.0% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.1% of the company stock.\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Amazon.com, Inc.. Insiders own US$207b worth of shares in the US$1.9t company. That's quite meaningful. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. \nWith a 26% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Amazon.com. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Amazon.com better, we need to consider many other factors.\nI always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "Title": "Could Amazon Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?",
        "Author": "  Adria Cimino, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has become a giant in two high-growth markets -- e-commerce and cloud computing -- over the years, growing earnings into the billions of dollars. The company's share price has followed, proving itself as a top long-term investment as it's likely helped make many people millionaires. The stock has advanced more than 1,000% over the past decade, for example, meaning that those who held on over time won big.\nIn 2022, Amazon even completed a stock split as its shares soared past $3,000. Today it's one of the world's biggest companies, with a market value of $1.9 trillion. All of this is positive, but after such successes, it's reasonable to wonder about what Amazon may accomplish down the road. Are the company's best days in the past, or could this hot stock still help you become a millionaire? Let's find out.\nFirst, a brief look into the past. Amazon has become the go-to destination for many of us when we shop for food or general merchandise online, and the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the No. 1 cloud services provider worldwide. In the most recent quarter, this resulted in a 13% increase in sales to more than $143 billion and a tripling of net income to more than $10 billion. And this quarter isn't an exception. Amazon's earnings generally have grown over the past several years.\nThe one exception happened in 2022, when higher inflation weighed heavily on the company, resulting in the first annual loss in about a decade. But this dark cloud has a silver lining, and that comes in the form of Amazon's work on its cost structure -- an effort that spurred recovery and should boost Amazon's earnings in better times too.\nThe company cut jobs, streamlined operations, and targeted key areas of improvement such as fulfillment. For example, Amazon shifted its fulfillment network from a national model to a regional one, and this has already lowered the company's cost to serve. At the same time, this allows Amazon to offer the lowest prices possible on items -- which keeps customers coming back -- and still make a profit.\nAs for AWS, this business has driven profit at Amazon year after year and has generally delivered double-digit growth in revenue and operating income. AWS has maintained its leadership as the world's biggest cloud provider and continues to invest in infrastructure to stay ahead. For example, AWS plans to launch new infrastructure regions in Saudi Arabia and Mexico, representing investments of more than $5 billion in each country over the coming years.\nSo, clearly, Amazon has reached positions of strength in these two big businesses. Could the growth keep on going? Yes, and Amazon's focus on artificial intelligence (AI) may be a big part of the next growth chapter. The company is using this technology to improve e-commerce operations and gain in efficiency, and this results in cost savings. One example is Amazon's use of AI to determine the best delivery routes -- a shorter, faster route from warehouse to doorstep equals lower costs for the company and pleases customers too.\nBut where Amazon may have the most to gain from AI is in its AWS business. The cloud giant sells many services to AI customers, with the goal of covering all of their needs -- from simple chips to a fully managed service that allows them to customize popular large language models to suit their needs. Amazon has already demonstrated the monetization potential of its AI investment, with AWS reaching an annual revenue run rate of $100 billion. So, AI could be a major growth driver for AWS and the entire company moving forward.\nNow let's get back to our question: Could Amazon help you become a millionaire? Alone, Amazon couldn't do the job unless you invested an enormous amount in the stock right now. But, along with a diversified portfolio of solid companies, Amazon could help you become a millionaire over time. Yes, the stock has advanced in the quadruple digits over the years, but thanks to its leadership in e-commerce and cloud and its investment in the hot growth area of AI, there's plenty of room for this top stock to run. And that's why it's still a great addition to your millionaire-maker portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jeannine Mancini ",
        "Text": "Jeff Bezos, a household name synonymous with Amazon, revolutionized e-commerce. But years ago, Amazon was just a dream Jeff Bezos shared with his brother and sister.\nIn the mid-1990s, investing in an online bookstore was a bold move. Bezos's siblings, Mark and Christina, took that leap. In 1996, they invested $10,000 each in Amazon, acquiring 30,000 shares. Today, those shares are potentially worth over $1.26 billion each.\nDon't Miss:\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare?\nA new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends. Here\u2019s how you can invest today.\nIn 1996, a $10,000 investment in Amazon was considered a substantial risk. However, a 2018 Bloomberg report revealed that when Amazon's stock price reached $91, their shares were valued at $640 million each.\nAt an Amazon share of $146, Bezos's siblings' stakes were valued at $1.025 billion each, as reported by Luxury Launches. Now, with the shares priced at $179, their stakes have grown to approximately $1.26 billion, marking an astonishing return of more than 12,566,658%. It's important to note that there is no public information on whether they have retained their shares.\nBezos founded Amazon in July 1994, envisioning the untapped potential of e-commerce. Despite the internet's limited use by government and educational institutions at the time, Bezos was committed to his vision.\nConvincing others to invest, however, proved challenging. Bezos held 60 meetings with family, friends, and potential investors, but 38 of them declined. Some of those who declined later admitted to regretting their decision, either accepting it as a life lesson or finding it difficult to discuss.\nTrending: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\nEven Bezos\u2019 parents were warned about the 70% risk of losing their investment. In the book \"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,\" he reportedly stated, \"I want you to know what the risks are because I still want to come home for Thanksgiving if this doesn't work.\"\nAmazon did face challenges along the way, including the dot-com bubble. The company went public on May 15, 1997, with shares priced at $18. Despite the challenges, Amazon survived and thrived, expanding far beyond its initial focus to become a tech giant with a market cap of $1.5 trillion.\nDespite their low public profiles, Mark and Christina Bezos have remained integral to Amazon's story. Mark pursued a successful career in advertising and philanthropy, while Christina has focused on family and charitable efforts.\nThe Bezos siblings' Amazon investment is undeniably a legendary success story. While not everyone has a brother like Jeff, their experience highlights the immense potential of investing in innovative startups.\nHigh risk often leads to high rewards, but this isn't the right path for everyone. If you're considering venturing into startup investments, it's wise to consult a financial advisor. They can help you assess whether this type of investment aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Remember, while the allure of high returns is tempting, safer and more stable investment options are available to suit different preferences and financial situations.\nRead Next:\nWarren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune \u2014 How much is that worth today?\nBoomers and Gen Z agree they need a salary of around $125,000 a year to be happy, but millennials say they need how much?\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAMAZON.COM (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Jeff Bezos Urged His Siblings To Invest $10,000 In Amazon \u2014 Their Stake Grew 12,566,658% And Potentially Worth $1.26 Billion Today originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

Over the past 18 months, big tech has made a series of headline-grabbing, billion-dollar investments in AI initiatives.\nAmong leading enterprises in the Magnificent Seven are Nvidia\u00a0and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). While Nvidia seems to have a strong pulse across all facets of the AI arena, I wouldn't over appreciate the company's dominance.\nLet's dig into what is driving Nvidia's growth right now, and explore how Amazon may leapfrog the company in the long run.\nNvidia designs sophisticated semiconductor chips called graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs have all sorts of applications ranging from training large language models, machine learning, autonomous driving, and more.\nBeyond the tech sector, generative AI has use cases in healthcare as well. Nvidia's GPUs are even being used by leading pharmaceutical companies such as Novo Nordisk -- the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy.\nUnsurprisingly, Nvidia's prolific reach has helped the company amass a staggering 80% share of the AI chip market.\nWhile it may seem as if Nvidia's lead is insurmountable, keep in mind that the AI revolution is still in its early stages. Although Amazon might look behind, I'd argue that the company is merely pacing itself and preparing for a marathon-style race.\nThe AI startup scene is absolutely packed. One of the more notable players is a machine learning company called Hugging Face, a unicorn that boasts Salesforce, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and IBM as investors.\nDo you notice anything from that investor syndicate? Many of them are either chip companies or cloud computing specialists.\nConveniently, Amazon is both. In addition to Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon is developing a line of training and inferencing chips. Aptly named Trainium and Inferentia, these chips are igniting new sources of growth for AWS as cloud computing becomes evermore competitive.\nMoreover, Hugging Face recently announced that it is partnering with AWS to deploy workloads on the newest version of Inferentia. I see this as a big win for Amazon, and it ultimately serves as stepping stone for the company to migrate away from a reliance on Nvidia products in the long run.\nAnother way Amazon is starting to build some momentum is from its $4 billion investment in another AI startup, Anthropic. Like Hugging Face, Anthropic is training its generative AI models on Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia chips and is also using AWS as its primary cloud provider.\nIf this weren't enough to depict Amazon as a serious contender in the AI realm, consider the company's planned $11 billion investment to build data centers. While Nvidia also competes in the data center space, companies such as Amazon and Oracle have their own plans.\nRight now, Amazon stock trades for roughly $179 per share. This is quite close to the company's all-time high of $189.\nWith that in mind, you might think Amazon stock is expensive. However, the chart below indicates something different.\nOver the past 12 months, Amazon's share price has risen by roughly 50%. By contrast, the company's trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS) has increased by 181%.\nSince the company's earnings growth is accelerating more than the share price, Amazon's price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple actually declines year over year. This means that even though the share price is touching all-time highs, Amazon is technically cheaper today than it was just last year.\nI think Amazon is underappreciated when it comes to AI. The company is investing aggressive sums and is already igniting some newfound momentum. Over time, I suspect that the moves the company is making today will pay off in spades and provide Amazon with a layer of flexibility over the competition.\nTo me, Amazon stock is dirt cheap and represents a compelling long-term opportunity in the AI space. While Nvidia will probably remain the posterchild of AI in the near-term, I think Amazon is making some savvy chess moves that will ultimately set it up as a superior long-term position.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Americans are flocking to Temu, but they trust Amazon so much more",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "One factor, above all else, helps explain the sensational rise of the online shopping marketplace Temu since its founding in 2022: ultralow prices. As a result, nearly six out of 10 U.S. online shoppers have made a purchase through the shopping marketplace in the past year, according to a recent survey commissioned by e-commerce marketing firm Omnisend.\nBut if Temu\u2019s going to continue to win the wallets of U.S. shoppers in the years to come, it\u2019s going to have to build something that its giant competitor Amazon has in spades: customer trust. Only 6% of Americans surveyed said they trust Temu more than Amazon.\nThose results, based on a survey of 1,000 online shoppers in the U.S., crystallize both the remarkable ascent of Temu, which launched in the U.S. less than two years ago, as well as the steep climb it still faces in building enough trust to keep U.S. customers coming back again and again for years to come.\nBacked by its Chinese e-commerce parent company, PDD Holdings, Temu has won the wallets of U.S. shoppers through a combination of ultralow prices, massive ad spending, and prolific use of coupons and gamification tactics. This strategy has enabled the app to continue to grow in the U.S. despite long delivery times, questionable product quality, and relentless marketing that can border on spamming.\nUnder a PDD subsidiary legally known as WhaleCo, Temu claims a Boston office as its global headquarters. But as Fortune reported exclusively in April, Temu employs few employees there and counts on large product and technology teams based in China to operate.\nThat strong China connection\u2014coupled with questions about whether any of its merchants use forced labor as well as its dependence on a century-old trade rule that eliminates duties on many shipments to U.S. shoppers\u2014has led to increased scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and agencies alike. The U.S. House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and some Senate Republicans have been pushing for probes into Temu.\nThe Department of Homeland Security has also recently said it will step up scrutiny of packages that fall under the \u201cde minimis\u201d trade program that is favored by overseas e-commerce giants such as Temu and Shein, as well as some U.S. merchants who utilize overseas suppliers and manufacturers. (Proponents of the trade rule say it helps keep prices low for U.S. consumers.)\nAs a result of scrutiny in the U.S., Temu is increasingly eyeing new geographies for future growth, the Wall Street Journal reported recently. Much of this might be welcome news inside Amazon, the dominant online retailer in the U.S. with about 40% market share. Company leaders have been paying increasing attention to Temu as well as its fast-fashion rival Shein. Though Amazon has cut some merchant listing fees for lower-priced apparel to help attract sellers that may sell through these low-priced marketplaces, the tech giant is also doubling down on the advantages it believes it already has: rapid delivery speed and strong brand awareness and consumer trust.\nAnd based on these survey results, that looks like a smart bet.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Amazon Prime Day is July 16-17: Here\u2019s how Google plans to capitalize on the hype, according to a Google Shopping exec",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "For more than 20 years, Google executives haven\u2019t been quite sure what they wanted their Google Shopping search portal to be when it grew up.\nA price comparison tool?\nAn actual product marketplace or online retailer that would compete with the likes of Amazon or Walmart or eBay?\nA combination of the two?\nFor now at least, it\u2019s made up its mind. And one of its executives, a former Amazon leader named Sean Scott, is trying to make the case that \u201cit\u2019s fiscally irresponsible to start your shopping anywhere else other than Google,\u201d as he said in a recent exclusive interview with Fortune.\nIf that \u201cirresponsible\u201d line sounds familiar, you might be an e-commerce nerd like me: Jeff Bezos once used a similar phrase in an annual shareholder letter, writing, \u201cWe want Prime to be such a good value, you\u2019d be irresponsible not to be a member.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have inventory, we don\u2019t take payment, we don\u2019t ship anything, we are really neutral,\u201d Google\u2019s Scott continued in the interview with Fortune. \u201cAnd we\u2019re just at it to show customers the best prices on the web from any merchant.\u201d\nCall Google the Switzerland of shopping\u2014albeit a Switzerland where retailers and brands need to buy ads if they want to appear at the tippy-top of search results.\nThe timing of Scott\u2019s pronouncement is not coincidental. In July, Amazon will host its annual two-day shopping event for Prime members, attracting attention not just from millions of shoppers around the Web, but other merchants big and small that will offer deals in an attempt to court some consumer attention. Scott knows the power of Prime firsthand: He worked at Amazon for nearly 15 years, including as a vice president overseeing the online retailer\u2019s core shopping experience. He joined Google in the fall of 2023 to run the consumer side of Google Shopping after a three-year stint at PagerDuty.\nDuring Amazon\u2019s Prime Day shopping extravaganza, Google searches for shopping deals actually surpass those related to travel or vacation, according to Scott.\nSo, Google has been rolling out and expanding shopping features in its search engine in an effort to capitalize on the increase in shopping activity around the web thanks to Prime Day. It has rolled out a special deals section to highlight discounted items across the Web, and has expanded its price comparison tools, including a feature that will show shoppers special pricing that a retailer might be offering members of their rewards or loyalty programs.\nGoogle is also touting its price-tracking features, which give shoppers the ability to get notifications if a product\u2019s price drops at an online retailer, and also track the price of goods over a 90-day period to understand if a deal that Amazon or another retailer is touting is actually a good deal.\nFor Google, Amazon is both friend and foe. On one hand, Amazon remains one of the largest advertisers on Google, paying to place sponsored product listings at the top of Google search results to pick off shoppers who may have started their product search there rather than on Amazon itself.\nBut over the past decade, Amazon has become a product-search powerhouse itself, with more than half of online shoppers in the U.S. beginning product searches on the everything store and less than half on Google.\nAs that has happened, Amazon has built a massive advertising business within its own shopping empire, generating nearly $47 billion in revenue in 2023. Google\u2019s core business, of course, is also advertising. A product search that begins on Amazon (or Walmart or Temu or Shein, for that matter) is a product search that Google can\u2019t monetize with ads. Part of the problem if you\u2019re Google, or the advantage if you\u2019re Amazon, is that many Amazon customers who become reliant on the Prime shipping program don\u2019t price-compare or shop around except, perhaps, on expensive items.\nMaybe more should. To be clear, Amazon has a reputation for low prices. Last year, for example, e-commerce analytics firm Profitero named Amazon the online retailer with the lowest prices for the seventh year in a row. (Note that a company like Temu wouldn\u2019t be included in a research study like that one because it doesn\u2019t sell brand-name goods across a wide selection of categories.)\nBut price-comparison research can indeed be worthwhile. I recently was in the market for an exciting purchase: an air filter for a furnace. For a variety of uninteresting reasons, I wanted to buy a single filter and not a multipack as I usually would. After wading through multipacks on Amazon\u2019s search results page, I found a single filter for sale. It cost around $18.\nThat\u2019s quite high, so I turned to Google. A quick search turned up a $6 filter being sold from a local Ace Hardware store, and a Pick Up Today badge further cemented my decision. Perhaps Amazon (or Walmart or another retailer) will show you a good price on many items, or the shipping speed you desire that matters more than saving money, but it\u2019s hard to argue with the idea of clicking over to Google for a minute or two if the lowest price is what you seek.\nAnd yet other new digital shopping tools continue to launch, especially as a result of the generative AI boom. A startup called Daydream, for example, recently announced a $50 million investment from venture capital firms including Forerunner Ventures. Daydream is run by well-respected industry veteran Julie Bornstein and says it is building an AI-powered search engine for products. Mass retailers like Amazon and Walmart are also testing gen-AI shopping assistants to further personalize the product search and browsing experience.\nShoppers also continue to get inspiration from influencers on video platforms like TikTok (which sells goods through TikTok Shop), Instagram, and Google sister site YouTube.\nBut Google is investing in AI-powered shopping tools as well, from a virtual try-on feature for various body types and skin tones to product-recommendation features.\nIn the end, though, Scott maintains, the goal is a straightforward one.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to help the customer shop, opening your eyes to new selections and new merchants at great prices,\u201d he said.\nAre you a current or former Google or Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "Author": "  Meghan Hall ",
        "Text": "Amazon refuses to let Shein and Temu encroach on its territory.\nAccording to CNBC, the e-commerce giant plans to launch a new section on its site full of discounted merchandise that will be shipped directly from China. The new storefront section, CNBC said, will offer unbranded items in the fashion, beauty and home categories, much like Shein and Temu\u2019s inventory. Reportedly, the products will cost less than $20 for consumers.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nUyghur Rights Advocates Win Appeal, Forcing UK Crime Watchdog to Investigate China Cotton Imports\nArkansas Official Takes Temu to Task Over Data Privacy Concerns\nAmazon Fined $6M for Violating California Warehouse Quota Law\nWhile Amazon already has a slew of Chinese sellers, the new program will not mandate that those sellers store products in the U.S. for Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) shipping, which benefited consumers because most products would still arrive inside a Prime delivery window.\nIncreasingly, consumers have become less concerned with shipping speed if the products are heavily discounted; according to CNBC, Amazon\u2019s new direct-from-China model could see packages taking nine to 11 days to arrive.\nCNBC noted that Amazon will begin to accept products, which can be tested in limited runs, in the fall and said the company hosted a closed-door meeting with Chinese sellers Tuesday sharing the opportunities and requirements associated with the program. However, it remains unclear when the new storefront will open for consumer shopping. Nonetheless, it will be well after Prime Day, which takes place in mid-July.\nThe purported new marketplace isn\u2019t Amazon\u2019s first foray into the discount space; earlier this year, it quietly launched Amazon Bazaar, a low-priced marketplace offering, in India.\nThe move likely signals Amazon has been feeling the pressure of Shein and Temu\u2019s continued affinity with the American consumer.\nSalesforce estimates that Shein, Temu, AliExpress and other similar platforms could command 21 percent of Western spending for the upcoming holiday season. If Amazon\u2019s new marketplace is up and running by then, it may have a chance to share in those profits, since Salesforce data shows that 58 percent of consumers choose platforms like Shein and Temu because of their ultra-low prices.\nBut Shein and Temu certainly haven\u2019t stood idle in the U.S. consumer race; Temu announced earlier this year it had set up a U.S. marketplace that would enable orders to arrive on consumers\u2019 doorsteps faster than ever before. Though data from Marketplace Pulse found that all of Temu\u2019s U.S. marketplace sellers were actually Chinese entities, those sellers have warehouse storage in the U.S. to enable quicker shipping.\nShein, too, has set up a marketplace, differing from its traditional direct-to-consumer model and allowing brands and sellers to hawk their goods. It uses Flexport to fulfill those orders and is slated to open a West Coast supply chain office.\nSalesforce\u2019s data shows 43 percent of Western shoppers placed a Temu order within the past six months. That figure rises to about half among Gen Zers.\nWhile an Amazon spokesperson did not directly confirm the addition of a discount marketplace, they said the e-commerce behemoth continues to look for ways to engage its customers.\n\u201cWe are always exploring new ways to work with our selling partners to delight our customers with more selection, lower prices and greater convenience,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n"

        "Title": "2 Reasons to Own Amazon",
        "Author": "  Kenio Fontes ",
        "Text": "In addition to its e-commerce dominance, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) leads in one of the most important segments today, the cloud. Not only that, but the company also operates in several other sectors in a complementary way, such as advertising, services and streaming. This shows us that Bezos' vision to set up an everything store has worked in recent years.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nThis constant innovation, combined with the prospects of profitability, presents an attractive picture for long-term investors.\nAlthough Amazon's share price may not be a great bargain currently, it is important to understand it in depth, as a superficial price-earnings analysis can lead to misunderstandings that the stock is grossly underpriced, which is not the case.\nWhen we evaluate its long-term growth prospects, through triggers such as margin gains, capital expenditure decreases and a series of growth paths, we have a company that, even with an extraordinary market cap, can continue to be a compounding machine and a good addition to a portfolio.\nThis diversification is directly reflected in Amazon's financials. Of course, most of the revenue is related to e-commerce, but even this is divided between online stores (more representative), third-party seller services and physical stores. Away from this part, which has a more compressed margin, we have AWS (which, although not the largest source of revenue, is by far the largest source of operating income), as well as some optionalities and complementary revenues, such as subscriptions and advertising.\nWhile consolidated revenue from North America grew by close to 12% in the first quarter of 2024, third-party services revenue advanced by 16%, with an increase in the adoption of optional services, such as fulfillment, global logistics and the like. In the earnings call, it was also mentioned that more than 100,000 partners are already using generative artificial intelligence tools offered by Amazon.\nOverall, retail is doing well and even though it is already very advanced, Amazon is showing it is possible to go further. In the first quarter, the company showed the fastest speeds ever in delivery, increasing this speed in other regions beyond the U.S. Not only that, but it is also building partnerships to include new brands to continue growing with new audiences.\nBut for me, the real efficiency gains must come through robotics and automation, which although the company has mentioned will take time, it has a solid plan that includes standardizing processes and moving forward with robotics. I believe the maturing of these initiatives means margins in the pipeline and a more controlled capital expenditure. In other words, a huge amount of value generation for shareholders.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, the North America segment's consolidated operating income margin was 1.20%, while International came in at -4% and AWS recorded 24%. These margins rose to 5.80%, 2.80% and 37% in the first quarter of 2024. In International alone, which is less representative, this evolution meant an increase of $2.10 billion in operating income.\nIn the U.S., Amazon is the clear market share leader in e-commerce and still has prospects to continue growing by continuing to consolidate the market and exploring new avenues. But that's not the case for the International business as in several regions the company has room to capture and consolidate even more. In Europe, for example, its market share is 13% of the continent's 20 largest online stores. Therefore, I believe in this vertical, Amazon has room for a more aggressive compound annual growth rate, along with an improvement in margin (narrowing the gap between North American and International margins). Again, this means greater cash generation.\nThe outlook for AWS (which is also the market share leader in cloud) is also very positive. The company tends to benefit from AI momentum, which in the first quarter has already shown through good growth in generative AI and non-generative AI workloads in a number of industries. According to Grand View Research, the cloud computing market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 21% between 2024 and 2030, driven by factors such as adoption across various industries and increased use of technologies such as AI and machine learning. As the market leader, this growth will be driven by AWS. On the other hand, the robust margin of this segment cannot be perpetuated, as mentioned by Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky:\n[...] we expect the AWS operating margins to fluctuate, driven in part by the level of investments we are making in the business. We remain focused on driving efficiencies across the business, which enables us to invest to support the strong growth we're seeing in AWS, including generative AI [...]\nAs Olsavsky also mentioned, sustaining AWS's growth also requires an increase in capex (which is why it expects a slight increase in 2024). This, as already mentioned, is a crucial factor for the thesis and future value generation. To give you an idea, Amazon delivered cash from operations of approximately $19 billion in the first quarter, while its capex was $14.90 billion. In other words, for the company to be able to generate relevant value (considering that its market cap is approximately $1.90 trillion), there needs to be an evolution on both ends. This includes an increase in cash from operations (through the factors already mentioned) and lower capex as the initiatives mature.\nIn summary, I think it is difficult to list the number of optionalities that Amazon's thesis has, including streaming, services, subscriptions and so on. But to name the most important ones, there is continued growth in e-commerce, but with increased profitability, as there is greater automation (this also applies to international) and AWS benefiting from the AI trend.\nAmazon's stock may seem expensive at first glance, but a closer look reveals a different story. As I mentioned previously, the price-earnings ratio can be misleading. The company has a very inflated multiple, but it is almost on purpose since Amazon's focus is currently not on net income (but on growth) and it does not reflect the cash from operations very well.\nAs stated by Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) and Charlie Munger, Ebitda is not a very good metric. Even though I also do not like to remove depreciation (and SBC) from the account, I believe that in Amazon's case it is valid. Despite a net income of $10 billion in the first quarter and operating income of $15.3 billion, its cash from operations was $19 billion (almost $30 billion of operating inflow). I do not want to say that depreciation in this case is good or that we should not consider the dilution of the stock-based compensation, but it is an exercise to see the size of the cash generated in recent times.\nWhen examining the company's cash multiples, we find reasonable levels, such as a price-cash from operations ratio of 19.70 and a price-to-free cash flow ratio of 42, even with the high capital expenditures. Indeed, both metrics cited are above the industry average and do not seem that attractive. But paying around 20 times the operating cash generation of Amazon, which is a premium company and has practically contracted growth, does not seem that bad to me. In other words, it is not a bargain, but it is not that rich a multiple either.\nThe GF Value Rank shows the company is no bargain with a score of 5 out of 10 due to high multiples. Further, the cash metrics are not so low as to sustain a good score or for the company to be considered cheap. But as is well known, multiples are not capable of capturing long-term growth, and this is what the market expects (which is why it is traded at these multiples) and I think some scenarios are quite feasible, in which Amazon manages to increase its operating cash flow through the initiatives mentioned and free cash flow through the decrease in capex, resulting in greater value generation for shareholders and lower multiples (even more reasonable).\nSource: GuruFocus\nIn back-of-the-envelope math, let's imagine that Amazon manages to grow its revenue by 8% (in all segments) by 2027. If its operating margin is 7% for North America, 5% for International and 32% for AWS (a good evolution, but nothing out of this world), we would find an operating income of almost $82 billion, an increase of 2.20 times. Using this figure as a basis, it is not hard to imagine that by then cash flow from operations could double from $85 billion to $170 billion.\nThere's also capex, which in 2023 was $52.7 billion and is set to increase in 2024. But it turns out that in a number of years pre-2020, this number was substantially lower, below $20 billion. Thinking about a lower level of investment in 2027, but still a level that supports a large infrastructure, we could end up with something close to $40 (a number I took arbitrarily) based on FCF of $130 billion. I created this whole scenario just to prove the point that it's not difficult to see Amazon with free cash flow above $100 billion in a few years, which would be a multiple below 20 for a company worth just under $2 trillion.\nAgain, this multiple still would not be a huge bargain, but we should remember that Amazon will probably remain relevant for decades to come and the growth prospects will not be over.\nEven four years from now, I believe Amazon will be priced at premium multiples that consider reasonable growth since new ventures are numerous, and many markets such as cloud and AI should maintain an aggressive CAGR. Amazon being traded for $2 trillion seems very reasonable to me, being an excellent company trading at a fair price.\nIn view of the information above, to be exposed to Amazon is to be exposed to a series of segments, which, despite their differences, have some similarities, such as being among the leaders in their respective markets and have high efficiency. This, coupled with the power of scale, translates into huge moats for Amazon.\nEven so, Amazon is not traded at exorbitant multiples or for absurd growth, but at a price that, while not a bargain, is justified given its great prospects and financial and operational strength, leading me to believe Amazon should remain a solid portfolio option and a possible ongoing compounder.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "By Greg Bensinger and Krystal Hu\n(Reuters) -Amazon.com hired away artificial intelligence startup Adept's co-founders and some of its team in a move that echoes one by rival Microsoft, as it seeks to battle a perception that it is playing catch-up in AI.\nAdept said in a blog post Friday that cofounder and CEO David Luan, as well as several other co-founders and employees were leaving to join Amazon.\nThe San Francisco-based startup, which has raised over $410 million and is valued above $1 billion, already named a new CEO.\nThe move is similar to one by Microsoft, which in March hired away much of Inflection AI's leadership and employees and agreed to pay a roughly $650 million licensing fee.\nThat deal has attracted regulatory scrutiny - the Federal Trade Commission is looking into whether the deal was a play to skirt merger disclosure requirements, a person told Reuters earlier this month.\nAdept said it would continue to operate independently of Amazon. Amazon will pay Adept a licensing fee to use some of its technology, which helps automate business functions. An Amazon spokesperson declined to disclose terms of the non-exclusive deal.\nAmazon is investing towards training an ambitious large language model, Reuters has reported, hoping it could rival top models from Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Alphabet. The new additions from Adept signal the tech giant's ambition to work on AI agents tools, an area major labs are focusing on.\nReuters reported earlier this month that Amazon is racing to update its Alexa voice assistant to fully integrate generative AI, which can respond almost instantaneously with full sentences to complicated prompts or queries.\nThe Amazon spokesperson said the Adept employees have already joined the company and about 20 Adept workers remain at the startup. Adept didn't respond to a request for comment.\nAt Amazon, Luan and a number of others will report to Rohit Prasad, who oversees artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Others will join the team developing devices and other services, according to an internal memo viewed by Reuters.\nPrasad, the former head of Alexa, who now reports directly to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, brought in researchers working on Alexa AI and the Amazon science team to work on training models, uniting AI efforts across the company with dedicated resources.\nPrasad said in the memo that the hires \"will significantly help us on our quest to achieving AGI.\"\nAdept also held discussions with other tech companies including Meta, which decided not to pursue a tie-up or partnership, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

According to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it hit a valuation nearing $2 trillion.\nThe generative technology can potentially boost a range of industries, from cloud computing to autonomous vehicles, e-commerce, productivity software, and much more. AI's growth potential suggests it's not too late to invest long-term in the industry and benefit from its future development.\nAs leading cloud companies, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) are two attractive options. These tech giants are investing heavily in AI and could have much to offer investors in the coming years. So, let's take a closer look at both and determine which is the better option today.\nIt's hard not to be bullish about Amazon after the last year. The company's business was hit hard by an economic downturn in 2022 that dragged its stock down 50% alongside significant profit losses. However, Amazon has since pulled off an impressive turnaround that has showcased its reliability over the long term.\nShares in Amazon have climbed 46% in the last 12 months. The retail giant has rallied investors with solid growth in its e-commerce segments and an expanding role in AI. In its most recent period (the first quarter of 2024), Amazon's revenue increased by 13% year over year. The company delivered a 12% rise in sales in its North American division and a 10% increase in its international segment.\nHowever, the largest increase came from its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It posted revenue gains of 17% year over year, with operating income soaring 84%.\nAWS is easily Amazon's biggest growth driver and grants the company a powerful position in AI. Over the last year, AWS has gradually expanded its AI cloud services and announced a venture into chip design. Meanwhile, recent growth indicates the company's heavy investment in AI is beginning to pay off.\nIn addition to cloud computing, Amazon is improving its e-commerce business with AI. The tech giant has introduced a new AI-powered shopping assistant called Rufus, alongside improvements to shipping logistics, tracking shopping trends, and product recommendations.\nAlphabet's AI efforts have lagged slightly behind rivals like Amazon and Microsoft, with the third-largest cloud market share behind both companies. However, Alphabet remains a compelling way to invest in AI, thanks to its diverse product range and massive user base.\nThe tech giant may be best known for its search engine, Google, but Alphabet is so much more. In fact, the company's primary business is digital advertising, which makes up more than 80% of its revenue. In-house brands like Android, YouTube, Chrome, and the many products under Google attract billions of users and offer almost endless advertising opportunities.\nMeanwhile, these brands could similarly help attract users to Alphabet's AI products. \u00a0Alphabet is sinking billions into AI, unveiling its most advanced AI model, Gemini, earlier this year. And on May 30, the company announced a $2 billion plan to build a new data center in Malaysia, equipped with a Google Cloud hub.\nIt will take time for Alphabet to realize its full potential in AI, but its range of potent brands indicates a solid outlook in the industry. Improved technology could allow the company to monetize its AI efforts by making Google's experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT, adding generative features to Android, expanding Google Cloud's AI tools, improving video recommendations on YouTube, and offering more efficient advertising.\nAlphabet is on a promising growth path in AI that might be too good to pass up.\nAlphabet and Amazon are behemoths in tech, evident by their positions as the world's fourth- and fifth-most-valuable companies by market capitalization. Their products are used by people and businesses worldwide, suggesting vast potential in AI.\nSince 2019, Alphabet and Amazon have delivered stock growth of 176% and 184%, respectively, illustrating their reliability as long-term holds. With such comparable businesses, the best way to determine the better stock could lie in their valuations.\nThis chart shows that Alphabet has a significantly lower forward price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash flow than Amazon, suggesting the Google company is trading at a far better value.\nIn addition to a range of potent brands and a vast user base, Alphabet is worth investing in over Amazon right now. However, it's still a good idea to keep Amazon on your radar and potentially buy when its shares are trading at a more attractive price point.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Oumar Fofana ",
        "Text": "In an era where sustainability intersects with technology, Amazon is pioneering a futuristic approach to package delivery that marries efficiency with environmental consciousness.\nThe tech giant has developed an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system known as the Package Decision Engine, transforming how products are packaged and delivered worldwide.\nThis initiative not only ensures that items arrive in perfect condition but also significantly reduces waste, aligning with Amazon\u2019s broader sustainability ambitions.\nAmazon's journey towards reducing its packaging footprint begins with the Package Decision Engine.\nThis AI-powered tool meticulously selects the most suitable packaging for each product, ranging from compact mailers to sturdy boxes, depending on the item's characteristics and vulnerability.\nFor instance, robust products like blankets might ship without additional packaging, while fragile items such as dinner plates require more secure packaging options.\nThe decision process is driven by a blend of deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision technologies.\nUpon arrival at an Amazon fulfilment center, each product undergoes a detailed assessment. It is first photographed in a high-tech tunnel that captures its dimensions and identifies any defects.\nThis imagery, combined with textual data from product descriptions and real-time customer feedback, feeds into the AI model. The Package Decision Engine evaluates this information and predicts the optimal packaging type, significantly minimising the use of unnecessary materials.\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of the Package Decision Engine is its ability to learn and evolve. Amazon's team has trained the AI model with millions of data points, including instances of successfully delivered products and those that arrived damaged.\nThrough this extensive training, the AI has learned to recognise key words and phrases that indicate a higher risk of damage, thereby suggesting more protective packaging options accordingly.\nThe engine continually updates its knowledge base with new data, ensuring its decisions improve over time. This dynamic learning process is crucial for handling Amazon\u2019s ever-expanding product range and adapting to varying regional and international packaging needs.\nThe implementation of the Package Decision Engine marks a significant milestone in Amazon\u2019s quest for sustainability. Since its inception, the system has helped the company eliminate over 2 million tons of packaging materials, showcasing a remarkable commitment to environmental stewardship.\nBy optimising package sizes and reducing the need for additional padding and fillers, Amazon is not only cutting down on waste but also enhancing the efficiency of its shipping and handling processes.\nLooking ahead, the potential applications of AI in packaging are boundless. Amazon plans to expand the use of the Package Decision Engine globally, adapting it to various languages, packaging types, and unique market needs.\nThis expansion includes deploying the model in diverse regions such as North America, Europe, India, Australia, and Japan.\nThe fusion of AI and sustainable practices in packaging is not just a boon for Amazon but serves as a model for other companies aiming to enhance operational efficiency while reducing their ecological footprints.\nAs AI continues to evolve, its role in industrial applications like packaging will undoubtedly expand, paving the way for more innovative and environmentally friendly solutions in global supply chains.\nIn essence, Amazon\u2019s AI-driven packaging strategy exemplifies how technology can be harnessed to achieve greater good\u2014optimising for efficiency and sustainability, thereby setting a new standard in the packaging industry.\n\"AI at Amazon: a game changer for sustainable packaging\" was originally created and published by Packaging Gateway, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Most readers would already be aware that Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock increased significantly by 9.5% over the past month. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Amazon.com's  ROE.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n17% = US$38b \u00f7 US$217b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.17 in profit.\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nAt first glance, Amazon.com seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 20% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Amazon.com's moderate 9.4% net income growth seen over the past five years.\nWe then compared Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 15% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is AMZN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\nGiven that Amazon.com doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Amazon.com's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. was fined $5.9 million for failing to provide written work quotas to employees at two warehouses in Southern California, an escalation in regulatory penalties imposed on the online retailer in the wake of a new state law that took effect in 2022.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNvidia Sales Grow So Fast That Wall Street Can\u2019t Keep Up\nHow Long Will High Rates Last? Bond Markets Say Maybe Forever\nRussia Is Storing Up a Crime Wave When Its War on Ukraine Ends\nCDK Hackers Want Millions in Ransom to End Car Dealership Outage\nHedge Funds\u2019 Bullish Copper Bets Run Into China\u2019s Slowdown\nThe California Department of Industrial Relations issued two citations in May, alleging Amazon violated the state\u2019s warehouse quota law. It requires companies to give workers written notice of productivity quotas \u2014 the number of tasks per hour required to avoid being disciplined. The state agency said Amazon failed to do this for employees at facilities in Moreno Valley and Redlands between October and March.\n\u201cUndisclosed quotas expose workers to increased pressure to work faster and can lead to higher injury rates and other violations by forcing workers to skip breaks, \u201d State Labor Commissioner Lilia Garc\u00eda-Brower said in a news release.\nAmazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel said the company has appealed the fines and disputes subjecting workers to quotas.\n\u201cAt Amazon, individual performance is evaluated over a long period of time, in relation to how the entire site\u2019s team is performing,\u201d she said. \u201cEmployees can \u2013 and are encouraged to \u2013 review their performance whenever they wish.\u201d\nThe Seattle-based company has been fending off federal and state regulators for a variety of allegations regarding working conditions in its warehouses. The US government doesn\u2019t regulate workplace quotas used to encourage employees to move quickly. So California, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington and New York have enacted their own laws specifically targeting warehouse quotas, while several other states have considered them. US Senator Edward Markey has proposed a similar law at the federal level.\nThe California fines stand out for the size of the penalty. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has fined Amazon for safety violations the agency said expose workers to injury risks at multiple warehouses in different states, but they tend to be in the tens of thousands of dollars. The new California law poses a bigger financial risk for Amazon, which has multiple warehouses in the state.\n(Updated with labor commissioner and Amazon comments beginning in third paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence\nMore Disabled Americans Are Employed, Thanks to Remote Work\nJPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "If you can\u2019t beat them, join them.\nFacing surging competition from Chinese cheap-stuff marketplaces Temu and Shein, Amazon is preparing to launch a new section of its site for Chinese sellers that want to ship their fast-fashion and lifestyle wares directly to U.S. customers. It could go live later this year.\nAccording to multiple reports\u2014The Information got there first\u2014Amazon held a meeting yesterday with the biggest Chinese sellers, detailing the plan. The presentation described a section that\u2019s accessible from the Amazon homepage and targeted at people who will put up with a nine- to 10-day delivery time if it means paying bottom dollar. (We\u2019re talking lightweight items that retail for under $20.)\nAmazon\u2019s new tactic would closely follow the Temu and Shein playbook by having sellers send their products to a warehouse in China, from which they would be sent directly to U.S. buyers. Currently, Chinese sellers send their products to Amazon warehouses in the U.S.\nThe distinction is important because the U.S. has a relatively high \u201cde minimis\u201d threshold of $800 on the value of imported goods: If the value is below the threshold, the item is not subject to import duties. Temu and Shein have both denied that this provision is central to their ability to sell things at ultralow cost in the U.S., but U.S. lawmakers disagree. A House select committee found that Temu\u2019s and Shein\u2019s shipments alone from their Chinese warehouses accounted for almost a third of the billion packages that entered the U.S. in 2023 using the de minimis loophole.\nIn April, the Biden administration ordered closer scrutiny of de minimis shipments from China, partly to check whether they\u2019re violating the U.S.\u2019s ban on goods produced with forced labor (a common accusation against Shein and Temu, and one that they have strenuously denied). There are also two bills lingering in Congress that would exclude China from the de minimis channel.\nThis may be one reason why Beijing just issued draft rules to make it easier for Shein, Temu, and AliExpress\u2014at this point the shining beacons of Chinese e-commerce prowess\u2014to finance the construction of new warehouses outside the country. But if America\u2019s Amazon is also about to get into the game of helping Chinese sellers access U.S. buyers through the de minimis channel, those legislative efforts in Congress could find it a little harder to drum up the support they need. (It\u2019s currently unclear whether Amazon\u2019s shipments will use the de minimis channel; I did ask, but an Amazon spokesperson did not answer my question.)\nOn the other hand, the competition presented by Amazon\u2019s move could further tarnish Shein\u2019s planned IPO, which CNBC said on Monday was set to take place in London, owing to lawmakers\u2019 opposition in the U.S. The date for the flotation is not yet clear, but British human rights group Stop Uyghur Genocide yesterday launched a legal campaign to stop it going ahead at all, owing to those aforementioned concerns about forced labor.\nMore news below.\nDavid Meyer\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Financial services company BTIG recently said in a report that the world\u2019s fifth-largest exchange-traded fund by assets under management (AUM), QQQ Trust Series 1, now trades \u201cwell into\u201d overbought territory based on its Relative Strength Index technical indicator.\u00a0 QQQ tracks \u00a0the Nasdaq-100 Index and it\u2019s not surprising to see the ETF showing signs of being overbought as more and more investors pile into mega-cap tech stocks in order to ride the AI bandwagon.\nFor this article we scanned the holdings of the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF and picked top technology holdings of the fund with higher Relative Strength Index (RSI) values. Usually, an RSI value of 60 and above shows a stock is overbought. We have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors with these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/ Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the top holdings of QQQ, which BTIG believes has entered the overbought territory in terms of RSI value. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has an RSI value of 62 as of June 23. The stock is seen as one of the biggest AI plays in the market due to its AWS business.\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0doesn\u2019t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled \u201cchatbot recommendations\u201d as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0strength in the application layer of AI.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is experiencing a surge in profitability, reflected in significantly higher retail profit margins. Strategic cost reductions in headcount and fulfillment have materialized into financial gains. While the unexpected pandemic-driven demand surge necessitated a rapid expansion of fulfillment infrastructure, this initially impacted operating profits. However, current unit sales growth has effectively reached equilibrium with fulfillment capacity. This balance is leading to positive adjustments to both earnings and intrinsic value estimates. Should the economic climate continue to improve, we believe Amazon\u2019s investment potential aligns with its projected 15-20% intrinsic value growth trajectory.\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) , our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "By Krystal Hu\n(Reuters) - Amazon said it is investing $230 million in the form of Amazon Web Service (AWS) credits in artificial intelligence startups, the latest example of cloud providers trying to capture AI clients from nascent stages.\nThe credits will provide early-stage generative AI startups free access to computing power, a variety of AI models, and infrastructure, if they build their companies on AWS.\nAmazon says it already offers $1 billion in cloud credits every year to startups, with this new commitment focusing on supporting generative AI startups.\n\"They'll be able to iterate very quickly and pivot very quickly as necessary. Then ultimately, when they hit on that home run, they'll be able to double down and get to the scale with security, responsibility and consistency,\" said Matt Wood, vice president of AI Products at AWS.\nPart of the credits will also support 80 early-stage companies globally through the AWS Generative AI Accelerator program, the company said. Each startup admitted to the accelerator could receive up to $1 million in AWS credits.\nIt's common for cloud providers, from Microsoft Azure to Google Cloud, to offer credits to lure enterprises to use their services, as cloud costs can pile up for a company as their usage increases.\nEarlier this year, Amazon has expanded its cloud credits to cover the use of models from providers such as Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, and Cohere, as the company aims to boost the market share of its AI platform.\nAI demand has driven up the usage of cloud services, contributing to the accelerated growth of cloud providers. For instance, AWS's revenue rose by 17% to $9.42 billion in the first quarter, surpassing analyst expectations. The investment by tech giants in AI startups have also attracted attention from regulators over antitrust concerns.\nHoward Wright, global head of Startups at AWS who managed startups relationships, recently left the company, according to people familiar with the move. Amazon declined to comment on the move.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)\n"

        "Text": "Amazon.com's plan to launch a discount shopping section would appeal to mainland Chinese suppliers with pricing flexibility, but competing with Temu and Shein in selling low-priced merchandise will not be easy, according to analysts.\nThe US e-commerce giant told Chinese merchants in an invite-only meeting on Wednesday that this new online budget marketplace will feature non-branded fashion items, household goods and daily necessities, which will ship directly to consumers from warehouses on the mainland in nine to 11 days.\nThat plan, first reported by online tech publication The Information, has already made a splash within China's cross-border e-commerce community, where heated discussions centred around joining this marketplace and related Amazon policies. This programme, however, is only open to select sellers.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\"The initial feedback from Chinese merchants has been quite positive even though Amazon has yet to officially launch the new programme,\" said Wang Xin, executive chairwoman of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association.\nSelect mainland Chinese merchants have been invited by Amazon.com to joint its new discount-shopping marketplace. Photo: Reuters alt=Select mainland Chinese merchants have been invited by Amazon.com to joint its new discount-shopping marketplace.

She said this is likely to appeal to mainland cross-border merchants and exporters - especially those who have worked with Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop - with the manufacturing capabilities, cash flow, talent and supply chain to make a difference for Amazon.\nThe US company's planned foray into the discount-shopping market segment shows a renewed effort to broaden its \"Made in China, sold on Amazon\" community, as many mainland suppliers struggle to boost their profits amid fierce competition between discount-shopping platforms.\n\"By leaving pricing in the hands of sellers, Amazon has offered a crucial way for them to maintain profitability,\" Wang said.\nAmazon.com's discount-shopping initiative is expected to attract suppliers who have worked with rival platforms Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop.

Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 2nd in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0George Soros\u00a0has been one of the most active and divisive figures in the Wall Street. Often a right-wing target, the billionaire handed over the control of his $25 billion empire to his son Alexander Soros last year. The 93 year-old Hungarian American is known as the philosopher investor in the Wall Street, mainly due to his contributions to philosophy and his deep desire to leave his mark in the world of philosophy, which many believe he fulfilled thanks to his General Theory of Reflexivity for capital markets.\nGeorge Soros founded Soros Fund Management in 1970. Since its inception through 2010, the fund posted on average a 20% annual rate of return.

A Jew by birth, Soros decided to come to the UK after the Nazi occupation of Hungary. Soros\u2019 first interactions with philosophy started when he was impressed by the works of Karl Popper. But Soros\u2019 dreams of creating a career in philosophy could not realize for several reasons, some of which he talks about in his book:\n\u201cI would have preferred to stay within the safe walls of academe\u2014I even had a teaching assistant job prospect at the University of Michigan in Kalamazoo, but my grades were not good enough, and I was forced to go out into the real world. After several false starts, I ended up working as an arbitrage trader, first in London and then in New York.* At first I had to forget everything I had learned as a student in order to hold down my job, but eventually my college education came in very useful. In particular, I could apply my theory of reflexivity to establish a disequilibrium scenario or boom-bust pattern for financial markets. The rewarding part came when markets entered what I called far-from-equilibrium territory because that is when the generally accepted equilibrium models broke down.\u201d\nFor this article we scanned Billionaire Soros\u2019s Soros Fund Management\u2019s Q1 portfolio and chose its top 9 stock picks.

        "Author": "  Will Daniel ",
        "Text": "Amazon is pushing for profitability in its embattled Alexa division with a new plan to offer customers an AI-powered version of its voice assistant for $5 to $10 per month. Dubbed \u201cRemarkable Alexa,\u201d the upgraded offering will provide a more personalized experience for customers and can perform more complex tasks than free Alexa versions, including writing emails, ordering food, or even making coffee after a morning alarm (at least when connected to a smart device), Reuters first reported.\nThere\u2019s a lot riding on the success of Remarkable Alexa. The Alexa division has been struggling with profitability for years, reportedly losing $5 billion in 2022 alone. Two rounds of layoffs in late 2022 and 2023 have helped stem the bleeding, but the latest AI push will need to translate to revenues quickly. Emphasizing this do-or-die sentiment, unnamed Amazon employees told Reuters that senior management called 2024 a \u201cmust win\u201d year for Alexa.\n\u201cIf Amazon does not see adoption of a paid tier \u2026 we think Amazon could cut Alexa investment further to reduce losses,\u201d Bank of America analysts, led by Justin Post, also warned in a Monday note.\nPost and his team did some back-of-the-napkin math to figure out just how much revenue Amazon\u2019s AI-enabled voice assistant might generate with the pricing that has been reported.\nThey found that while many Alexa devices are out of service, if just one in five is active with a unique user, that would translate to 100 million active users. And if 10% of those users are willing to pay $5 per month for Alexa, that would provide Amazon with $600 million a year in revenue. At $10 per month, that number doubles to $1.2 billion.\nThis means Amazon can expect between $600 million and $1.2 billion in incremental revenue from an AI-enabled Alexa, even with limited adoption\u2014but Post noted that these estimates are conservative for a reason.\nThere are a number of free alternatives to Remarkable Alexa, including ChatGPT, Google Assistant, Apple\u2019s Siri and even the regular, free version of Alexa, that could draw customers away. \u201cWe think Alexa\u2019s capabilities will need to improve to stay competitive with AI advances from competitors,\u201d Post wrote.\nThe analyst also said he believes that \u201cAI functionality may be more useful on a PC [or] phone versus [a] voice device like a home speaker.\u201d\nStill, Post and his team remain bullish on Amazon overall, arguing plans for an AI-enabled Alexa offering show the company is \u201ccommitted to improving Alexa\u2019s economics.\u201d\nOther changes at Amazon, including new fees for ad-free Prime Video and adjusted fees for grocery deliveries, also suggest an \u201congoing focus on profitability\u201d that should benefit share prices, according to BofA. Growth in Amazon\u2019s advertising business should also boost profitability, said Post, who has a \u201cbuy\u201d rating and a $210 12-month price target on shares of Amazon.\nThe stock dipped 0.98% to $187.51 by 1 p.m. ET on Monday.\nAmazon declined an offer to comment on Bank of America\u2019s research report, but gave this statement on its plans for Alexa. \u201cOur vision for Alexa remains the same\u2014to build the world\u2019s best personal assistant. Generative AI offers a huge opportunity to make Alexa even better for our customers. We have already integrated generative AI into different components of Alexa, and are working hard on implementation at scale\u2014in the over half a billion ambient, Alexa-enabled devices already in homes around the world\u2014to enable even more proactive, personal, and trusted assistance for our customers.

Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.96% upward. Currently, Amazon is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nLooking at its valuation, Amazon is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 40.38. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 21.34.\nAlso, we should mention that AMZN has a PEG ratio of 1.36. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Internet - Commerce industry was having an average PEG ratio of 0.95.\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 71, this industry ranks in the top 29% of all industries, numbering over 250.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "Associated Press Finance ",
        "Text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon joined the exclusive $2 trillion club Wednesday after Wall Street investors pushed the value of the e-commerce giant's stock past that threshold.\nShares in Amazon.com Inc. finished the day up almost 4%, giving the Seattle-based company a stock market valuation of $2.01 trillion. Its stock has gained 52% in the past 12 months, partly driven by enthusiasm for the company's investments in artificial intelligence.\nAmazon now joins Google's parent Alphabet, software behemoth Microsoft, iPhone maker Apple and chip maker Nvidia among companies with valuations of at least $2 trillion.\nLast week, Nvidia hit $3 trillion and briefly became the most valuable company on Wall Street. Nvidia's chips are used to power many AI applications and its valuation has soared as a result.\nAmazon has also been making big investments in AI as global interest has grown in the technology. Most of the focus has been on business-focused products, including AI models and a chatbot called Q, which Amazon makes available to businesses that use its cloud computing unit AWS.\n\u201cA big part of the valuation boost has been cloud and AI,\u201d said Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives. \u201cAmazon is going to be a major player in the AI revolution.\u201d\nIn April, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that AI capabilities have reaccelerated AWS\u2019 growth and that it was on pace for $100 billion in annual revenue. The unit's growth slowed last year as companies cut down on costs amid high inflation.\nAmazon has also invested $4 billion in the San Francisco-based AI company Anthropic to develop so-called foundation models that underpin generative AI systems. In addition, Amazon makes and designs its own AI chips.\nOutside of its cloud business, Amazon has cut costs significantly since late 2022, laying off more than 27,000 corporate employees across several divisions. It reported revenue and profits for the first quarter of the year, aiding by growth in AWS as well as its core retail business and advertising. All those things are boosting investor sentiments, said Neil Saunders, the managing director at GlobalData Retail.\n\u201cCertainly, there are downsides, but these are mostly external \u2014 such as the threat from the FTC,\u201d Saunders said, alluding to the federal agency's antitrust lawsuit against the company.\nBut, he said, \u201cinvestors see these clouds as a long way off so they are not dampening the current valuation.\u201d\n"

        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "Sun Country Airlines\u2019 cargo activity and profits will significantly improve under an amended transportation services agreement to operate freighter aircraft for Amazon\u2019s e-commerce parcel network, an executive with the leisure carrier said Friday.\nUnder the revised contract announced Thursday, Amazon will place eight additional Boeing 737-800 converted freighters with Sun Country (NASDAQ: SNCY) to operate on its behalf. The retail giant also extended the contract until 2030. The aircraft, which Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is transferring from Atlas Air\u2019s air operating certificate to Sun Country\u2019s, will be delivered between the first and third quarters next year.\nMinneapolis-based Sun Country, which has operated a dozen 737-800 freighters for Amazon for four years, will earn profit margins roughly equal to its passenger business once all the aircraft join the fleet after negotiating improved terms, Chief Financial Officer Dave Davis said on a briefing call with equity analysts. Flight hours for the cargo fleet will increase by 60% to 65% next year because of the additional aircraft and then continue to grow on an annual basis at 13% to 15%, he added.\nSun Country generated cargo revenue of $100 million in 2023, up 10% from the prior year. Cargo represented about 9.5% of the airline\u2019s total revenue.\n\u201cOnce we are fully ramped towards the late third quarter of 2025, the contribution margin of the Amazon flying will be basically on par with the contribution margin of our passenger flying on a historical basis,\u201d Davis said.\nSun Country\u2019s operating margin for passenger operations was 14% in 2023 and negative 5% for cargo. Cargo is expected to align with passenger margins by 2026. Negative cargo margins do not reflect the contribution of the Amazon flying to profitability because they are heavily burdened with overhead costs in the financial statements, but the magnitude of the cargo improvement will be about 19% to 20%, Davis explained.\nTalks with Amazon about an expanded role for Sun Country began about six months ago and intensified in the past two or three months.\nAmazon in May agreed to end its partnership with Atlas Air, which will gradually wind down flying for the e-commerce marketplace over the next 15 months. Atlas Air also operates 16 Boeing 767 freighters for Amazon, which will reallocate at least 10 of them to cargo airline ABX Air between now and December. No reasons were given for the breakup.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our belief that Amazon has focused on reliable service above all else to serve their customers. So we think we\u2019ve demonstrated that over the years and been rewarded with these additional aircraft. They\u2019re our most important relationship at the company, and we want to continue to provide that level of service as we go forward,\u201d Davis said.\nSun Country will temporarily cut scheduled passenger capacity by about 11% in 2025, mostly during the slow seasons, to accommodate the transition with pilots and other resources, and then begin adding passenger flights again in 2026 as more planes join the fleet, management said. The reduction in scheduled passenger operations comes as passenger business is softening because of excess capacity across the industry and slower demand from leisure travelers. Management said second-quarter revenue will come in at the low end of guidance, about $256 million, and operating margin will be 4% to 5%, instead of a 7% upper range.\nDavis foreshadowed an improved deal with Amazon at Bank of America\u2019s annual transportation conference in mid-May, saying high cargo margins at the contract\u2019s start in early 2020 have since come down and that Sun Country needed to take more aircraft and negotiate better terms to achieve acceptable profit. An increase in pilot costs after the pandemic is the primary reason behind the lower margins, he said.\nAmazon hasn\u2019t informed Sun Country yet about the new routes it will fly, but the airline hopes the extra freighters will enable it operate a more efficient schedule, which will contribute to the bottom line, the CFO added.\nSun Country has virtually no ownership costs associated with growing the fleet because Amazon provides the aircraft, which are leased from an aviation investment company, and is responsible for loading and unloading. Davis acknowledged startup costs, such as pilot training, will be in the low-digit millions of dollars.\nOne of the benefits of a hybrid business is that pilots are interchangeable among passenger, cargo and charter flying, but Davis said Sun Country will need to hire more pilots to support the larger fleet.\nAmazon pays Sun Country a flat amount per aircraft operated as well as by the number of flight hours.\nUnder the original transportation services agreement, Sun Country issued warrants giving Amazon the option to purchase up to 15% of the airline\u2019s stock. No additional stock warrants were issued with the amended agreement, but management said the time for exercising the options could be accelerated because they are based on the amount of total revenue Sun Country receives and revenue will now come in faster than before.\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\u00a0\nAmazon transferring Boeing 737-800 cargo jets to Sun Country Airlines\nAtlas Air to end Amazon flights, focus on international customers\nAmazon hires ATSG to fly 10 Boeing 767 freighters\nThe post Revised Amazon deal to boost Sun Country\u2019s cargo profits appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Author": "  Emma Burleigh ",
        "Text": "Good morning!\nWorkers across the U.S. are worried that they could be replaced by AI, and a new feature story about Amazon from Fortune\u2019s Jason Del Rey shows what those fears look like up close.\nThe company says it laid off more than 100 workers in various customer service departments\u2014although insiders told Fortune upwards of 600 roles may have been cut. And the employees who managed to keep their jobs are worried they're being used to train their AI replacements.\nCompany executives recently required that all customer service employees use an internal software tool called AC3 to resolve customer complaints, which gives them a direct Q&A dialogue to follow. These agents also noticed that when AC3 straightens out a refund problem, the final message addresses a customer rather than an employee. That has led Amazon workers to believe that the tech is meant for customers to use independently, settling issues themselves without human assistance.\nOne customer service manager told Fortune that when they confronted their boss about the issue, they confirmed that the cloud software is being trained to replace the frontline agents. An Amazon representative did not provide comment to Fortune on this workforce concern.\n\u201cI spoke to a dozen Amazon customer service employees for this article and many believe it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, they lose their job to AI. And I found it quite telling that Amazon PR chose not to comment about these fears.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s customer service workers aren\u2019t the only ones worried that they will eventually be replaced by AI. \u201cFear of becoming obsolete\u201d is a growing labor force anxiety, and with good reason. Around 4,600 American workers have already lost their jobs to AI between May of 2023 and this January of 2024, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc. Executives are well-aware of these labor shifts, too\u2014nearly half of company leaders say ChatGPT has replaced employees at their businesses, according to a survey from ResumeBuilder.com.\nSectors like customer services are particularly vulnerable to AI disruption, according to a new report from McKinsey. Other roles that could be in the crosshairs include sales, food services, and production and manufacturing. Goldman Sachs predicted AI would automate 300 million roles by 2030, and OpenAI board member Larry Summers says the tech could eventually replace \u201calmost all forms of human labor.\u201d Industry titans like IBM have already opened up about the AI-employee switcheroo, whittling down some HR-related staff from 700 to 50 workers due to tech innovations.\nThe AI revolution is here, and it's going to be messy. In bracing themselves for changes to come, companies should address tech fears within their own workforce, have open conversations about the ethics of AI, and assure staffers that humans will have a place in the future of automated work.\nEmma Burleighemma.burleigh@fortune.com\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com's estimated fair value is US$313 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nAmazon.com's US$187 share price signals that it might be 40% undervalued\n The US$218 analyst price target for AMZN is 30% less than our estimate of fair value\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$62.1b\nUS$78.3b\nUS$102.3b\nUS$117.3b\nUS$142.3b\nUS$161.0b\nUS$176.9b\nUS$190.4b\nUS$201.9b\nUS$212.0b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x16\nAnalyst x18\nAnalyst x9\nAnalyst x5\nAnalyst x4\nEst @ 13.10%\nEst @ 9.89%\nEst @ 7.63%\nEst @ 6.06%\nEst @ 4.95%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% \nUS$58.0k\nUS$68.3k\nUS$83.3k\nUS$89.2k\nUS$101.0k\nUS$106.7k\nUS$109.5k\nUS$110.0k\nUS$109.0k\nUS$106.8k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$942b\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$212b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.1%\u2013 2.4%) = US$4.6t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.6t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$2.3t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.3t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$187, the company appears quite undervalued at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.025. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "Title": "Amazon Stock Just Set a New All-Time High. Here's Why I'm Still Buying.",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Some investors understandably worry about purchasing stocks when they are at all-time highs. While it seems like a stock would be vulnerable to a drop at those levels, it's best to look at the bigger picture. Over the long term if it's a quality business, the stock should continue to gain in value.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) recently hit a new all-time high in early May, but has pulled back a couple of percentage points since then. Still, I think Amazon's stock is a great buy right now. Here's why.\nAmazon has been firing on all cylinders as a business. It divides its business into three divisions: North America, international, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). In previous quarters, at least one of its three major segments wasn't doing well, but that's not the case now.\nThe e-commerce side of Amazon, which is split up by geography, is much wider than its online store. It also includes rapidly growing segments like third-party seller services, advertising services, and subscription services. In fact, Amazon's online store segment only grew 7% year over year when all regions were combined. However, these other segments helped North American and international sales rise by 12% and 10%, respectively.\nWhile that is respectable growth, the profits in these divisions were outliers. The North American segment delivered nearly $5 billion in operating income (up 455% year over year), and international delivered its first operating profit ($903 million) since the second quarter of 2021.\nThis is evidence that Amazon's efficiency focus continues to have a massive effect and will drive higher profits throughout 2024 if they stay on their current path. Should Amazon's trajectory continue, 2024 will be an exciting year on the commerce side of the business.\nWhile the commerce side of the business delivers the bulk of revenue, the AWS cloud computing business delivers the profits. In 2023, AWS struggled because its customers were focused on optimizing their spending. According to management, that trend has largely wrapped up, and new workloads far outweigh the decreasing ones.\nIn Q1, AWS revenue rose 17% to $25 million, the highest total revenue in the cloud computing industry. This growth rate marks the fastest since Q4 of 2022. Higher revenue also drastically increased AWS's operating income, which rose 84% to $9.4 billion.\nThese figures clearly show why Amazon is hitting new all-time highs. Revenue is up double digits, and operating income is rising incredibly fast as well. This combines for a stock set to deliver more record highs should that success continue into Q2 and beyond.\nHowever, one drawback may be the stock valuation. Amazon trades at a high valuation if you utilize the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\nAmazon's stock is hard to value because its earnings are rapidly increasing due to efficiency improvements combined with strong revenue growth. As a result, the forward P/E is a bit more of a shot in the dark than most investors would like.\nStill, I think investors can confidently buy Amazon at this valuation because analysts only think Amazon will produce earnings per share of $4.53 over the next 12 months. In Q1 alone, Amazon produced $0.98 per share, and Q1 was historically one of Amazon's weakest quarters. As a result, I think the forward P/E of 40 is a conservative estimate, and the stock is far cheaper than that in reality.\nEven though Amazon recently set a new record high, I'm confident it can continue to rise even more throughout 2024.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "We Think Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Can Stay On Top Of Its Debt",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.\n Check out our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Amazon.com had US$73.3b of debt in March 2024, down from US$92.9b, one year before. However, it does have US$85.1b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$11.8b.\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Amazon.com had liabilities of US$153.0b due within a year, and liabilities of US$161.3b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$85.1b and US$41.7b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$187.5b.\nGiven Amazon.com has a humongous market capitalization of US$1.84t, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Amazon.com also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.\nBetter yet, Amazon.com grew its EBIT by 232% last year, which is an impressive improvement. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Amazon.com's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. While Amazon.com has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Amazon.com reported free cash flow worth 15% of its EBIT, which is really quite low. That limp level of cash conversion undermines its ability to manage and pay down debt.\nWhile Amazon.com does have more liabilities than liquid assets, it also has net cash of US$11.8b. And we liked the look of last year's 232% year-on-year EBIT growth. So we don't have any problem with Amazon.com's use of debt. Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all. If you've also come to that realization, you're in luck, because today you can view this interactive graph of Amazon.com's earnings per share history for free.\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.\nHave feedback on this article?

Market analysts soon started pointing to the concentration of gains phenomena in the market, where just a few stocks accounted for most of the broader market gains. This tech concentration remains strong as of today, as all important AI and Cloud technologies that we see in the news are developed, acquired or marketed by mega-cap tech companies we\u2019re all familiar with.\nBig Ten AI Stocks\nBank of America analyst Michael Hartnett recently said in a report that the S&P 500 has gained about 12% so far in the year, but if we remove 10 technology companies from the equation, these gains shrink to just 3.6%. Hartnett calls these companies the \u201cAI Big Ten\u201d group.\nWhat about the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that kept making headlines in 2023 and early 2024? Hartnett calculated that the broader market gained just 4.9% so far this year if these seven stocks are taken out of the equation. There is a third group of stocks that most investors are unaware of: Hedge Fund Top 30. These 30 stocks include the Magnificent Seven as well as 23 other promising stocks. These 30 stocks returned 53.2% in 2023, 20.2% during the first 5 months of 2024 vs. 11% for the S&P\u2019s large cap index.

Should the economic climate continue to improve, we believe Amazon\u2019s investment potential aligns with its projected 15-20% intrinsic value growth trajectory.\u201d\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon\u2019s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack \u2013 infrastructure with NVIDIA\u2019s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc.

        "Text": "US stocks edged higher Wednesday as Amazon (AMZN) led a tech jump that saw the company cross $2 trillion in market cap for the first time ever.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged 0.04% higher. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up about 0.5%, leading the way higher.\nTreasury yields inched off their 3-month lows. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added about 8 basis points to climb back to 4.31%.\nA wobbly last handful of sessions has left investors wondering whether the drag on stocks is temporary or the start of a more solid retreat. The outsize impact of Nvidia (NVDA) stock on broader performance has underlined the question.\nOn Wednesday, it was Amazon leading tech megacaps higher, as the stock rose nearly 4% on its way to becoming the fifth US company ever with a $2 trillion-plus value.\nAt the same time, the market is looking to economic prints for cues ahead of the key PCE inflation release on Friday. Federal Reserve speakers this week have underlined their caution in deciding to make interest-rate cuts, dependent on the data.\nElsewhere, Rivian (RIVN) shares surged more than 23% after the EV maker announced an alliance with Volkswagen (VWAGY) that could boost its coffers by up to $5 billion. FedEx (FDX) stock jumped more than 15% as its 2025 profit forecast topped Wall Street estimates.\nInvestors also kept a close eye on Chipotle (CMG) as its 50-for-1 stock split took effect this morning \u2014 the largest in the history of the NYSE. Shares in the burrito seller were up a modest 0.3% on Wednesday.\nAmazon (AMZN) led the gains in tech on Wednesday, rising about 4% to cross a $2 trillion market cap for the first time ever. The e-commerce giant's surge was the largest among the megacap stocks on Wednesday.\nNotably, the 0.5% gain in the Nasdaq came with little help from Nvidia (NVDA), which was up a modest 0.25%.\nBelow is a look at how megacap tech performed on Wednesday.\nWeekly jobless claims have been ticking higher over the past several weeks.\nThe 243,000 claims in the week ending June 8 were the highest print since August. The most recent reading showed a similar trend, with 238,000 claims for the week ending June 15.\nThe next release is set for 8:30 a.m. on Thursday, economists surveyed by Bloomberg anticipate 235,000 claims were made in the week ending June 22.\nFor now, many economists have reasoned that this uptick hasn't been enough to be a true sign of concern. But, as we highlighted last week, some economists are growing increasingly concerned about signs of softening in the labor market amid the high-interest-rate environment.\nA continued uptick in weekly jobless claims would indicate that those fears are well placed, as economists often reference the dataset as a \"real-time\" indicator of the labor market's health.\n\"The data of the past few weeks have been signaling incremental labor market weakness, albeit from a position of extreme strength,\" Jefferies US economist Tom Simons wrote in a research note after the last jobless claims release. \"It is still too early to tell if this is another step in the process of the labor market coming into better balance, or if it is the early stages of building momentum to the downside.\n\"We are inclined to think that it is the former, but we are cautiously watching the next few weeks' worth of data to see if a trend is emerging.\"\nAmazon (AMZN) led the Yahoo Finance trending tickers page on Wednesday, rising just less than 4% and crossing a $2 trillion market capitalization for the first time ever.\nRivian (RIVN) stock rose more than 20% after the company after the EV maker announced a joint venture deal with Volkswagen (VWAGY), crucially bringing fresh capital into Rivian\u2019s coffers. Amazon is the largest shareholder in Rivian.\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also cracked the trending tickers pages despite a less than 1% move on the day. Wednesday marked the first day Chipotle began trading following a 50-for-1 stock split that sent the price from $3,283.04 per share to about $65 per share.\nMore consumers are choosing to watch free, ad-supported streaming platforms (otherwise known as FAST channels) amid the rapid rise of subscription prices from traditional streamers.\nAd-free streaming plans have become a primary target of price increases as media companies like Netflix (NFLX), Max (WBD), and Amazon (AMZN) raise the costs of their respective offerings. Paramount (PARA) joined the price hike bandwagon on Monday, announcing it will raise the monthly costs of its Paramount+ tiers, both with and without Showtime, beginning Aug. 20.\nBut as prices rise, consumers are turning to other options. Free options.\nFAST providers the Roku Channel (ROKU), Fox affiliate Tubi (FOX), and Paramount's Pluto TV all saw viewership upticks during the month of May, according to the latest data from Nielsen.\nTubi, for example, led year-over-year growth for Fox following a nearly 5% monthly viewing increase. It secured a platform-best 1.8% of total TV usage for the month as a record 1 million viewers tuned in. This represented a 46% year-over-year increase, with Tubi's average audience racing ahead of traditional streamers like Disney+, Peacock, Paramount+, and Max, Nielsen confirmed.\nMeanwhile, a 1.3% monthly bump in viewing to the Roku Channel led the FAST provider to a platform-best 1.5% share of TV. It was the only company to climb in the rankings for May, nabbing 10th overall.\n\"We're seeing [the FAST] model resonate more and more with younger audiences because their taste and preferences with what's good and what they want to watch is evolving,\" Tubi CEO Anjali Sud said on the Ringer\u2019s podcast \"The Town With Matthew Belloni\" in April.\n63% of Tubi's audience are \"cord cutters\" or \"cord never,\" while 40% are not on other traditional streamers.\n\"It is different to be 100% free,\" Sud told Belloni. \"We're not asking you to subscribe to an ad tier or a subscription tier. We're not trying to upsell you. The fragmentation and friction is reduced.\"\nIt's a similar model to what has made YouTube, owned by parent company Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), such a massive success.\nAccording to Nielsen, YouTube amassed 9.7% of overall viewership on connected and traditional TVs in the US during the month of May \u2014 the largest share of TV for a streaming platform ever reported by the agency.\nExperts say YouTube's growth has led to the increased interest in ad-supported options like FAST channels, especially from younger consumers.\n\"YouTube is essentially pushing us towards [this] very search-driven experience,\" said Vikrant Mathur, co-founder of Future Today, a company that specializes in ad-supported connected TV solutions. \"I'm looking for a movie or a TV show. I find it wherever I find it. I go watch it. As long as there's no barriers to that content, I prefer that experience rather than having to subscribe.\"\nStill, it's not a proven business model. Tubi, which Fox acquired for $440 million in 2020, has yet to turn a profit ,with its long-term outlook also in question amid the expected reacceleration of M&A within the industry.\n\"I'm probably a little bit more cautious than others,\" Tim Nollen, an analyst at Macquarie, told Yahoo Finance, noting FAST providers must utilize a different strategic approach compared to other streamers given their lack of premium or exclusive content.\n\"A lack of premium content means they have to be effective at using technology to target the users that they do have,\" Nollen said. \"It's a large audience, but it may not be a particularly engaged audience. I think they will be successful at using technology to target those users. But it might be in a somewhat different manner.\"\nAmazon (AMZN) stock rallied more than 4% on Wednesday to surpass a $2 trillion market cap for the first time ever.\nAmazon joins Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) as the only US companies to surpass a $2 trillion market cap. Shares of the e-commerce giant are now up more than 27% year to date.\nYesterday we highlighted research from BlackRock and other equity strategy teams that largely said they aren't overly concerned with the fact only a few stocks are driving the major indexes higher.\nIn simple terms, they argued those companies have seen most of the earnings growth, and therefore, it makes sense they're rallying the most.\nStill, a common concern is that the market could be at risk if a few large tech companies that have driven the lion's share of the gains stop surprising the upside.\nCiti head of equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser, speaking with Yahoo Finance on Wednesday morning, offered another counterpoint to the concentration debate.\n\"If you look back historically, this is kind of how equity markets behave,\" Kaiser said. \"You know, over any 12-month period, you're going to have 40 to 50% of returns come from just 10 stocks.\"\nHe added, \"It worries you a bit. But again, it's not unprecedented.\"\nAs of Monday's close, AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) had accounted for nearly one-third of the S&P 500's gains this year, and outperformance in quarterly results from large-cap tech continues to be a reason why earnings for the S&P 500 are growing year over year.\nMeanwhile, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO) had also contributed more than a quarter of the major index's gains.\n\u00a0\nThe first presidential debate is set for Thursday night.\nYahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul highlighted one key area to watch on Thursday: \nMost of the top issues up for debate on Thursday are likely to make either President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump uneasy, but taxes could be a key exception.\nBoth campaigns appear to be of the mind that it's a winning issue for them based on a wave of expectations-setting from both sides this week. And both are signaling plans to go on offense when it comes up.\nTrump, looking to tap into many Americans' dislike of taxes, will tout his plans for a wide array of cuts.\n\"Who wants to have high taxes?\" Trump asked about Biden's plans in a recent podcast appearance, listing it among Biden's \"worst policies.\"\nBiden is set to respond by underlining his populist position on the issue and repeating his promise to raise taxes on big corporations and the 1%.\nTrump's plan is to give \"tax cuts to the ultra-wealthy on the backs of the middle class,\" read a pre-debate memo from Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign's communications director.\nThe broad strokes of the two candidates' tax positions are well known ahead of a mammoth tax debate set for next year, but experts note there is still a lot to learn.\nThe winner this November will help decide the fate of a range of provisions from the Trump-era tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of 2025.\nBiden has often discussed his 2025 plan as focused on renewing provisions from those 2017 cuts that impact Americans making under $400,000 a year while letting the provisions for the rich expire.\nBiden also released a budget that pushes for an increase in the corporate tax rate to 28%.\nTrump's overall campaign message is a promise for a straight extension of those 2017 cuts and perhaps further reductions.\nTrump also floated an array of tax ideas during a recent visit to Washington, including lowering the corporate tax rate to 20% from its current 21% level, as well as a long-shot idea to scrap the entire US income tax system in favor of higher tariffs.\nBut for all the noise around the issue \"we haven't seen many specifics on each side's tax policy vision holistically,\" said Garrett Watson, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation.\nConsumer Discretionary (XLY) was the only of the 11 S&P 500 (^GSPC) sectors to be in the green on Wednesday morning. The sector was up about 0.6% after strong earnings from FedEx (FDX) sent shares of the company up nearly 15%. The positive results also offered a more upbeat read-through on the consumer overall leading into a report from Nike (NKE) expected Thursday after the bell.\nEnergy (XLE) was leading the losses on Wednesday, falling more than 1%.\nNew home sales hit a six-month low as high mortgage rates continued to weigh on buyers.\nSales of new single-family homes fell 11.3% to a seasonally adjusted rate of 619,000 units last month from April\u2019s revised seasonally adjusted annual rate of 698,000, according to Census Bureau data released Wednesday.\nMay's number was the lowest since November. It also missed consensus expectations of 633,000 units, per Bloomberg data.\nAffordability concerns have kept potential buyers from snapping up new homes and sellers, many of whom are locked into lower mortgage rates, from moving. The average weekly rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage still hovers well above 6%, according to Freddie Mac. \nMeanwhile, home prices have been hitting new record highs. Prices in the 20 largest US metros increased 7.2% in the last 12 months ending in April, per S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller data released Tuesday.\nThe drop in sales activity in May contributed to an uptick in available inventory, Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant said in an email. At the end of the month, the seasonally adjusted estimate of new homes for sale was 481,000, marking the highest month-end new home inventory since 2008.\n\u201cHomebuilders had been enticing buyers with rate buydowns and other concessions, but for some homebuyers, those financial incentives are no longer enough to get them on the building lot,\u201d Sturtevant said.\nShe added, \"With more housing inventory and softening demand, expect the third quarter of 2024 to be a slower new housing market than the second half of 2023. However, while new home inventory is back at 2008 levels, other fundamentals in the market are significantly different than they were 16 years ago. The job market is strong, there is still pent-up demand among Millennials, and for all the increase in inventory, overall supply is still below pre-pandemic levels.\u201d\nRivian stock (RIVN) surged nearly 30% on Wednesday after the EV maker announced a joint venture deal with Volkswagen (VWAGY), bringing key fresh capital into Rivian\u2019s coffers.\nYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports:\nVolkswagen announced it intends to work with Rivian to create \u201cnext generation software-defined vehicle (SDV) architectures\u201d to be used in both companies\u2019 future EVs. The joint venture will use Rivian\u2019s \u201czonal hardware design\u201d and platform as the foundation of future vehicles, as well as Rivian\u2019s electrical architecture expertise for the vehicles. Rivian will license its existing IP rights to the joint venture.\nIn exchange, Volkswagen will invest an initial $1 billion in Rivian through an \u201cunsecured convertible note that will convert into Rivian\u2019s common stock,\u201d with up to $4 billion in additional investment staged through 2026 for a total infusion of $5 billion.\nFor Rivian, the news of fresh capital allays concerns over the company\u2019s runway as it bridges to the release of its next-generation vehicles, the R2 and R3 mass-market SUVs. In terms of its cash cushion, Rivian said it had $5.98 billion at the end of Q1 versus $7.86 billion at the end of Q4.\n\"This news is meaningfully positive for RIVN as the agreement should provide the company with access to capital to not only fund the ramp-up of production of the R2 at its Normal, IL facility but also to build a new facility in Georgia for its mid-size vehicle platform,\" Bank of America analyst John Murphy wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. \"We have assumed RIVN would need to raise more capital, and VW's investments in RIVN will prove valuable in helping it achieve the scale necessary to get to positive free cash flow.\"\nMurphy also noted potential benefits from cost savings and operating efficiencies in the joint venture deal, which could ultimately lead to higher gross margins.\nUS stocks slipped on Wednesday after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq snapped a three-day losing streak, as investors watched for signs of life in the tech-driven rally and weighed the prospects for rate cuts.\nThe benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell around 0.2% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped about 0.4%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid about 0.1% as Nvidia (NVDA) extended its rebound.\nThe moves lower in stocks came as Treasury yields inched higher. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) added 6 basis points to climb back to 4.3%.\nWithin the past four days, investors have witnessed the fundamental remapping of America's two iconic package shippers: FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS).\nI am just not sure those investors understand how laser-focused each respective management team is on becoming more efficient and driving better margins by unwinding legacy thoughts.\nFedEx shares are up 15% in the pre-market as the company surprised the masses by saying it's exploring strategic alternatives for its LTL (less than truckload) business. FedEx has the largest LTL franchise in the US, but growth has slowed and its profit margins lag those at competitors.\nEvercore ISI analyst Jonathan Chappell did a little numbers-crunching overnight and came up with an intrinsic value on FedEx of $362 a share. That assumes it no longer operates an LTL business and becomes solely focused on its Ground and Express franchises.\nFedEx shares are currently trading at $292 in the premarket.\n\"There is likely to be a sum of the parts premium in the stock until confirmation of the path forward,\" said Chappell.\nI underestimated FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam.\nHis CEO tenure got off to a rocky start with a few bad quarters, and I thought the near FedEx lifer wasn't going to challenge the status quo. That appears to not be the case as Subramaniam is showing a knack for aggressive cost-cutting and a desire to challenge the status quo even as founder Fred Smith watches over him on the board.\nAs for UPS, on Sunday it unloaded its logistics business to RXO (RXO) for $1 billion.\nI have known UPS CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 going back to her CFO days at Home Depot (HD). She has always \u2014 and I mean always \u2014 looked for ways to do business more efficiently while not hurting the core business. That's what she has been doing at UPS since day one, and I suspect she has a few more tricks up her sleeve to drive costs down now that the logistics business is sold.\nRivian (RIVN) is ripping higher by 39% in the premarket after its buzzy $5 billion deal with Volkswagen (VWAGY).\nThe deal is broken down into a $3 billion direct equity investment into Rivian and $2 billion investment into a 50/50 owned joint venture.\nThe company will be holding an investor day Thursday at its Illinois factory, so I suspect the stock could stay volatile into the weekend.\nHere are a couple of ways to unpack the new Rivian/VW tie-up.\nRivian goes from having Wall Street be concerned about the need to raise more funding (speculation was north of $4 billion) to removing that risk from the table in the medium term.\n\"The $3 billion equity injection over the 2024-26 period should keep Rivian funded through the launch of R2 and the build-up of the Georgia facility,\" said Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois in a client note.\nPiper Sandler's Alexander Potter thinks the deal sends a key signal to the auto industry at large and its many investors.\n\"Specifically, it suggests that proprietary ECUs, electrical architectures, and software are necessary for automakers to control themselves. Rivian and Tesla (TSLA) have long advocated for in-house mastery of these technologies, and now Volkswagen is (apparently) attempting to replicate their approach. New Chinese brands are moving at an unprecedented speed, and only through vertical integration can other automakers hope to keep pace,\" Potter said.\nCiti's Itay Michaeli is calling out Lucid as a derivative trade off the deal.\n\"We\u2019d highlight Lucid (where shares are down 41% YTD) as one name that could come into greater focus given its leading battery efficiency and openness to licensing to other automakers. It\u2019s also conceivable that the proposed VW-Rivian JV could improve EV sentiment more broadly,\" said Michaeli.\nLucid shares are up 9% premarket. The company's ticker page is on top of the Yahoo Finance trending ticker page.\nFull disclosure on Chipotle (CMG) stock-split day.\nHaving done this for 21 years, I know a stock split doesn't change the intrinsic value of the company whose stock is being split. But I must admit, going onto Chipotle's ticker page on Yahoo Finance this morning and seeing $65 a share as opposed to $3,283 (yesterday's closing price) initially made me think \"Wow, the stock is cheaper \u2014 time to buy!\"\nI suspect others will have that initial feeling as well. But I remind you that the company is no different fundamentally than yesterday at the close.\nYahoo Finance's Brooke Dipalma reports here on what the stock split means to investors.\n"

Strategic cost reductions in headcount and fulfillment have materialized into financial gains.

        "Author": "  Shilpa Mete ",
        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s AMZN shares have gained 16.1% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the Zacks Internet Commerce industry\u2019s return of 11.1%. The e-commerce giant is riding on the solid momentum in its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d).AWS has been riding on an expanding clientele on the back of its strengthening generative AI capabilities. This is evident from its latest partnership with SAP SAP.Per the terms of this collaboration, AWS and SAP strive to accelerate the implementation of generative AI for various enterprises.SAP intends to embed generative AI solutions across its enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications with the help of AWS.SAP will integrate generative AI models from Amazon Bedrock, such as the Anthropic Claude 3 model family and Amazon Titan, into its generative AI hub in SAP AI Core to provide its customers with access to several large language models (LLM) and foundation models (FM).With the latest partnership, AWS has become the first cloud provider certified to support the SAP portfolio.SAP, which already uses AWS Graviton3 chips to support SAP HANA Cloud, now plans to leverage AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia chips to train and deploy future SAP business AI offerings.Clearly, SAP\u2019s extended collaboration with AWS has added strength to the latter\u2019s clientele.\n\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nPer an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market is likely to hit $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.AWS\u2019s growing generative AI efforts are expected to aid Amazon in capitalizing on the immense growth prospects in the generative AI market.AWS is gaining significantly from the solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.AWS also offers Amazon CodeWhisperer, which is designed to provide generative AI-powered customized code suggestions by leveraging an organization's internal codebase.The company\u2019s recent collaboration with NVIDIA, through which it will make the latter\u2019s Blackwell GPU platform available on AWS, is a plus. This will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion-parameter language models.\nStrengthening generative AI capabilities, along with AWS\u2019s other robust cloud solutions, expanding data center network, and an increasing number of AWS Regions and Availability Zones are bolstering its customer base.Recently, NinjaTech AI partnered with AWS to launch its next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using the latter\u2019s machine learning chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.CrowdStrike extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. It is using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker in order to boost innovation in SIEM transformation, and novel cybersecurity AI use cases.Brightcove started using Amazon\u2019s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media and entertainment technology sectors.BlackBerry recently unveiled a generative AI-backed cybersecurity advisor called Cylance Assistant, which leverages Amazon Bedrock to enable organizations to enhance their cybersecurity operations.We believe that AWS\u2019s expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2024, AWS generated revenues of $25.04 billion (18% of the total sales), which grew 17% year over year.The strengthening performance of AWS will drive Amazon\u2019s overall performance, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $638.24 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11%. The same for 2024 earnings stands at $4.58 per share, implying year-over-year growth of 57.9%. The EPS estimate has moved north by 1.1% over the past 30 days.\nExpanding clientele will continue to help AWS sustain its dominant position in the global cloud market and gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google.Amazon accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in first-quarter 2024, per the latest Canalys data.Microsoft, which accounted for 25% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $26.7 billion in revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2024 (43.2% of the total revenues), up 21% year over year. The business is benefiting from the robust adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 31% year over year.Google Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting the company's cloud position. Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud acquired 10% of the market and reported revenues of $9.6 billion (11.9% of the total revenues), up 28.4% year over year in first-quarter 2024.\nAmazon is riding on AWS\u2019s expanding clientele and strong partner base. Its expanding global presence is a positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus that is helping it outperform cloud peers, including Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.Amazon currently has a Value Score of B, which makes it an attractive pick for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon AMZN is continuously making strong efforts to bolster its presence in India. This is evident from its latest fresh capital infusion of Rs 600 crore (about $72 million) into Amazon Pay India.With this investment, the e-commerce giant strives to strengthen its digital payment app business in India. The digital payment market is booming due to the ongoing digitization and increasing adoption of cashless transactions.According to a report from Statista, the Indian digital payment market is anticipated to generate a total transaction value worth $254.6 billion in 2024. The figure is expected to reach $394.4 billion by 2028, seeing a CAGR of 11.6% between 2024 and 2028.Amazon remains well-poised to capitalize on the aforementioned growth prospects on the heels of its increasing investment in its digital payment app.The latest move brings its total investment in Amazon Pay to Rs 950 crore so far this year in India. The company made an investment of Rs 350 crore in February in its payments platform.In addition, Amazon Pay is gaining popularity in the country on the back of the services that it provides, which include bill payments, unified payments interface (UPI) payments, wealth management, ticket booking and insurance premium payments.Moreover, Amazon Pay\u2019s tie-ups with platforms like Bookmyshow, Makemytrip, Redbus, IRCTC, and Kuvera are positives.As of May 31, Amazon Pay India had 67.5 million prepaid wallets and processed 623 million transactions worth over Rs 211 crore during the month.\n\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nThe Indian digital payment space is highly competitive in nature, given the rapidly increasing number of UPI transactions, which is giving a significant boost to it.With growing Amazon Pay investments, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ups its game against peers like Paytm, Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google Pay, Walmart WMT owned Flipkart\u2019s PhonePe and Meta Platform\u2019s META WhatsApp Pay.\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Alphabet and Walmart are making concerted efforts to strengthen their presence in the booming digital payment market of India.Recently, Alphabet\u2019s Google signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Payments Corporation of India to expand the use of Google Pay to other countries. This will allow Indian travelers to make payments in other countries via Google Pay.PhonePe is enjoying solid customer momentum on the heels of its digital wallet service, which allows users to make instant money transfers with UPI. In addition to PhonePe, Walmart\u2019s Flipkart unveiled a UPI app called Super.Money, which offers up to 5% real cashback on transactions, pre-approved credit and fixed deposit accounts. Super.Money is currently in the beta stage.Meanwhile, Meta is gaining steam with WhatsApp Pay, which is powered by BHIM UPI and processed by payment partners in India. The app allows users to make payments on the app using UPI apps, debit cards, credit cards and net banking.\nAmazon is well-poised to benefit from its expansion spree in India in the near term, as well as in the long haul.

        "Author": "  MICHELLE CHAPMAN ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) is shifting from the plastic air pillows used for packaging in North America to recycled paper because it's more environmentally sound, and it says paper just works better.\nThe company said Thursday that it's already replaced 95% of the plastic air pillows with paper filler in North America and is working toward complete removal by year's end.\n\u201cWe want to ensure that customers receive their items undamaged, while using as little packaging as possible to avoid waste, and prioritizing recyclable materials,\u201d Amazon said.\nIt is the company's largest plastic packaging reduction effort in North America to date and will remove almost 15 billion plastic air pillows from use annually.\nAlmost all customer deliveries for Prime Day this year, which happens next month, will contain plastic no air pillows, according to Amazon.\nThe e-commerce giant has faced years of criticism about its use of plastic from environmental groups, including a nonprofit called Oceana, which has been releasing its own reports on Amazon\u2019s use of plastic packaging.\nMatt Littlejohn, senior vice president of strategic initiatives at Oceana, said that Amazon's efforts to reduce plastic packaging is welcome news, but that there's still more that the company can do.\n\u201cWhile this is a significant step forward for the company, Amazon needs to build on this momentum and fulfill its multiyear commitment to transition its North America fulfillment centers away from plastic,\u201d Littlejohn said in a prepared statement. \"Then, the company should expand these efforts and also push innovations like reusable packaging to move away from single-use packaging everywhere it sells and ships.\u201d\nThere has also been broad support among Amazon investors who have urged the company to outline how will will reduce waste.\nThe company disclosed the total of single-use plastic across global operations for the first time in 2022 after investors sought more details on plans to reduce waste. The company said that it used 85,916 metric tons of single-use plastic that year, an 11.6% decrease from 2021.\nAmazon began transition away from plastic air pillows in October at an automated fulfillment center in Ohio. The company said that it was able to test and learn at the center there, which helped it move quickly on transitioning to recycled paper filling.\nThe transition process included changing out machinery and training employees on new systems and machines.\nAmazon discovered through testing that the paper filler, which is made from 100% recyclable content and is curbside recyclable, offers the same, if not better protection during shipping compared with plastic air pillows, the company said.\nChristian Garcia, who works at Amazon's fulfillment center in Bakersfield, California, said in a release that the paper filler is easier to work with and that the machinery gives staff more space so that it's easier to pack orders.\nOngoing efforts to reduce waste include a campaign to ship items without any additional packaging, the company said. In 2022, 11% of all of Amazon's packages shipped worldwide were without added delivery packaging.\nOther efforts include piloting new technology with artificial intelligence and robotics company Glacier to use AI-powered robots to automate the sorting of recyclables and collect real-time data on recycling streams for companies. It's also partnering with the U.S. Department of Energy on new materials and recycling programs.\n"

Four other co-founders and an unspecified number of other team members will also join Prasad\u2019s group.\nAmazon will license Adept\u2019s technology developing agents, or AI tools that can perform tasks autonomously, to help Amazon build products that can automate software work flows, according to the memo. Representatives for both companies declined to disclose financial terms, and Amazon declined to say how many Adept workers the company hired.\nAdept raised $350 million at a valuation of at least $1 billion in March of last year from investors including General Catalyst and Spark Capital, Forbes previously reported. In a blog post Friday announcing the deal, Adept said its plan to focus on building both foundational AI models and a tool for businesses \u201cwould\u2019ve required spending significant attention on fundraising for our foundation models, rather than bringing to life our agent vision.\u201d\nWith the staff that remains, Adept will continue to operate separately with a more product-focused mission, according to Prasad\u2019s memo to Amazon staff.\n\u201cDavid and his team\u2019s expertise in training state-of-the-art multimodal foundational models and building real-world digital agents aligns with our vision to delight consumer and enterprise customers with practical AI solutions.\u201d wrote Prasad in the note to staff. Luan will report to Prasad as the leader of the AGI autonomy team and the automations team, according to the memo.\nAmazon\u2019s range of efforts in AI include a shopping chatbot and other tools for its retail sites; AI-models-for-rent sold through its cloud-computing arm; and Prasad\u2019s group, which built the algorithms behind the Alexa voice assistant and was restyled as Amazon\u2019s artificial general intelligence unit in a reorganization last year.\nUnlike some of its big tech peers like Microsoft Corp. and Google, Seattle-based Amazon hasn\u2019t focused as much on developing a broader, more ambitious artificial general intelligence, or AGI, that can perform most intellectual tasks as well or better than humans.\nThe Adept agreement also comes at a time that technology companies have stepped up hiring from well-funded AI startups that are building costly foundational models. In March, Microsoft hired a large portion of the staff of Inflection AI and arranged a deal to license its technology for $650 million. That accord has since come under antitrust scrutiny by regulators at the FTC, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nZach Brock, Adept\u2019s head of engineering, will take over as CEO. About 20 employees will remain on Adept\u2019s staff, according to Amazon. Those staying on Adept\u2019s team will continue to work on \u201csolutions that enable agentic AI,\u201d the startup said in its blog post.\n--With assistance from Matt Day.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing\nOnline Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America\nThe Fried Chicken Sandwich Wars Are More Cutthroat Than Ever Before\nFor Tesla, a Smaller Drop in Sales Is Something to Celebrate\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Malone, Liberty bought F1 from CVC Capital Partners in a deal announced in 2016. Since then, it has focused on increasing the sport\u2019s global appeal, growing its audience with marketing gambits like behind-the-scenes Netflix Inc. documentary series Formula 1: Drive to Survive.\nBut in a sport heavy on engineering, whose human protagonists are hidden behind helmets, executives want ways to jazz up the live race broadcast too. The companies say they\u2019re also using AI to offer in-race predictions on matters like pit-stop timing or when a driver might try to overtake a rival, based on real-time details such as car performance and tire degradation.\n\u201cWith this data and the intimacy with the fan, you can contemplate hyper-personalized experiences,\u201d AWS Canada Managing Director Eric Gales said in an interview at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal earlier in June.\nRalph said: \u201cThat\u2019s where we want it to go, so you as a fan can choose how much data to see and what stories you want to be told.\u201d\nVying against other sports, streaming shows, TikTok and video games, the battle for attention has never been so intense. While F1 has broadened its reach in the US with the Netflix series and new races such as the Las Vegas Grand Prix, the sport is still sometimes panned as too predictable. Last year, F1\u2019s top driver, Red Bull Racing\u2019s Max Verstappen, won 19 of the 22 races; this year he has won six of nine.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just rely on giving them a passive experience,\u201d said Dean Locke, F1\u2019s director of broadcast and media, speaking to reporters in Montreal remotely from the group\u2019s media and technology center in Biggin Hill, UK.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election\nMusk\u2019s Population Obsession Comes With a Dark History\nWhy BYD\u2019s Wang Chuanfu Could Be China\u2019s Version of Henry Ford\nThe FBI\u2019s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along\nHow Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for \u2018You\u2019 Perfume Into a Lasting Business\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

This week, Amazon claimed it had surpassed that goal by reportedly providing $2.2 billion across 21,000 affordable units.\nIn measuring the local impact on the Puget Sound region of western Washington, The Seattle Times reported that while any investment in additional housing is beneficial, Amazon has also been slammed for contributing to the challenges the area is facing due to \u201chigh corporate salaries [contributing] to a skyrocketing cost of living.\u201d\nIn a news conference this week, Jassy said that the company knows that housing \u201cis a really big challenge for a lot of people, especially in and around expensive metro areas. We feel strongly we can help give back to our communities by helping preserve and create thousands of affordable homes.\u201d\nThe funding is targeted. Amazon said it primarily aims to provide the money via a mix of loans and grants to \u201chouseholds that earn 30% to 80% of the area median income.\u201d The company said this population often includes \u201cfirst responders, teachers, health care workers, and others who may not typically qualify for subsidies but whose wages haven\u2019t kept pace with escalating rents.\u201d\nIn King County, where Seattle sits, that usually translates to income levels of $28,800 to $70,650 for an individual, or $41,100 to $100,900 for a family of four, based on 2023 data from the King County Housing Authority that was cited by the Seattle Times.\nThe announcement also added some new details to a previously announced partnership with the National Housing Trust, saying that the Seattle effort on that initiative will start with a pilot project of 83 homes that could eventually grow to 800.\n"

        "Author": "  Maurie Backman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "\nEvery time I say things like this, I feel like an old fart, but here goes: These days, it seems as if half of my credit card bill is various services and subscriptions.\nYears back, my charges would mostly consist of expenses like groceries and gas for my car. Today, I have recurring bills for meal delivery kits, streaming services, and so many subscriptions it's hard to keep track of everything.\nThat's why I do a subscription audit every few months -- to make sure I'm not wasting my money on services I don't use enough. I also think carefully before signing up for a new service.\nIf you're looking for a service that gives you access to free shipping on online orders, you may be inclined to sign up for Amazon Prime or Walmart+. But which is the better pick? That depends on you.\nAmazon Prime and Walmart+ are pretty similar in some ways. Both give you free shipping on orders of any size, and both give you access to free streaming content.\nBut there are some differences in terms of factors like cost and added perks. Here's a comparison table so you can see what each includes.\nFeature\nAmazon Prime\nWalmart+\nCost\n$139 per year\n$98 per year\nFree trial\nYes: 30 days\nYes: 30 days\nFree shipping\nYes: no order minimum\nYes: no order minimum\nStreaming content\nPrime Video\nParamount+\nSavings on gas\nNo\nYes: $0.10 per gallon\nFree clothing try-on before buying\nYes\nNo\nFree tire care\nNo\nYes\nFree grocery delivery\nOrders over $100\nOrders over $35\nTravel perks\nNo\nUp to 5% Walmart cash back\nData source: Amazon Prime and Walmart+.\nAll told, at first glance, it seems like Walmart+ may offer more benefits than Amazon Prime, and at a lower price point. But you'll need to think about which service better fits with your lifestyle.\nIf you're not sure whether Amazon vs. Walmart+ makes the most sense, ask yourself:\nHow often do I shop at Amazon vs. Walmart? Chances are, the retailer you use most currently is the one whose service it pays to go with.\nDo I drive or have a car? You won't benefit from gas savings from Walmart+ if you don't have a vehicle. On the other hand, the free grocery delivery might come in very handy if you don't have a way to drive to a supermarket. So these factors sort of cancel each other out.\nHow often do I order groceries for delivery? The low order minimum from Walmart+ is a big draw here, but if you prefer to shop in person, you may not use this feature.\nUltimately, since each service offers a free trial, it pays to try each one for a month and see how it goes. And if you can't really spot a difference, you may decide that Walmart+ makes more sense because the lower price point fits better into your budget.\nOne thing you probably don't want to do, though, is sign up for both Amazon Prime and Walmart+ at the same time.

        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Happy Friday. This is Jason Del Rey.\nWhen our Fortune 500 issue dropped earlier this month, I was thrilled to read many inspiring tales of business success and innovation chronicled by my colleagues. But another fact also caught my attention\u2014just 52 or 10.4%, of the 500 largest U.S. companies by revenue are run by women. While that\u2019s eight more companies than two years earlier in 2022, it\u2019s exactly the same as the 52 women-led Fortune 500 companies on last year\u2019s 2023 list. A couple of steps forward, and then one year standing in place.\nAlmost immediately, I thought of the company I\u2019ve reported on the closest over the last decade: Amazon. Since I began covering the tech giant in 2013, I\u2019ve heard a version of the same reality from women who\u2019ve left the company: They can build long, lucrative careers at Amazon but, for many, their ceiling ends up being lower than their male counterparts. This is not an uncommon realization among women in the tech industry.\nWhen I first wrote on this topic back in 2017, one needed to look no further than the composition of Amazon\u2019s senior leadership team\u2014known as the S-team\u2014to understand this reality. At the time, Amazon had 19 S-team members including then-CEO Jeff Bezos, and 18 were men. The one exception was Beth Galetti, the SVP of human resources or, in Amazon speak, the People Experience Technology division, or PXT.\nTwo years later, in 2019, Amazon\u2019s S-team had grown to 22 people, with three female executives. That\u2019s about 14%.\nToday, the S-team has expanded to 30 executives, comprised of 25 men and five women. For those counting at home, female representation inside this exclusive group stands at a little less than 17%.\nThe reality is a bit more nuanced than that though. While it is true that S-team members lead Amazon\u2019s largest business lines, Galetti is the only one among the five female executives to report to CEO Andy Jassy himself\u2014alongside 14 men. That stat speaks for itself.\nAt the two executive levels below the S-team, composed mainly of roles with titles of vice president (Level 10) and director (Level 8), there are some signs of improvement on the gender representation front, according to Amazon\u2019s recent workforce disclosure. In 2023, 26.7% of executives at Level 8 or above were women. That\u2019s up from 25.2% in 2022 and 24.1% in 2021.\nBut earlier this month, I was reminded of Amazon\u2019s male-dominated leadership beyond the numbers. As part of the FTC\u2019s antitrust lawsuit against the tech giant, a log of Signal messages between Amazon leaders was made public. While the exact content of the Signal messages is not disclosed in the log, the dates and high-level descriptions of the messages are, as well as the names of the chat participants.\nOne of those message threads began in the last week of March 2021. At the time, tensions were high inside Amazon\u2019s executive ranks as Amazon warehouse employees in Bessemer, Ala., were gearing up for one of the only union elections in the company\u2019s history (Amazon is notoriously anti-union). The union supporters found vocal support from both Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the latter of whom spoke at a rally for the union organizers on March 26.\nThat same day, a Signal chat between eight Amazon leaders\u2014all men\u2014began. The chat participants included outgoing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, then-Amazon consumer CEO Dave Clark, Amazon general counsel David Zapolsky, as well as four Amazon communications executives, led by former comms chief Jay Carney and current communications boss Drew Herdener.\nThe Amazon log document describes the thread simply as \u201crelating to public relations issues\u201d (though the union battle appears to have been the most significant public relations issue facing the company at the time the thread began). What appears to be clear is that when Amazon leadership was grappling with a PR issue significant enough to involve the incoming and outgoing CEOs, the broader group of people invited to the virtual table was exclusively male. While HR chief Galetti and Amazon Studios head Jennifer Salke make appearances elsewhere in the Signal log, the eight-man thread says a lot about where most of the real power in the company lies.\nIn an emailed statement, Amazon spokesperson Zoe Hoffmann said the company is \u201ccommitted to increasing representation throughout our workforce through the hiring, retention and development of women across the company at all levels.\u201d She added that the company has created leadership and development efforts to further those efforts.\nAs for the log of Signal messages, Hoffmann argued that it\u2019s misleading and inaccurate to suggest that messages on a single platform are indicative of the way Amazon leaders make decisions. She also echoed Bezos\u2019s own FTC deposition in which he said he didn\u2019t use Signal to discuss \u201ccomplicated business issues\u201d or business matters \u201cof any substance.\u201d\nAt the same time, Amazon has been the subject of multiple gender discrimination lawsuits over the last few years. The company has denied the accusations and fought them in court.\nWhile gender equality inside Amazon\u2019s corporate offices has been improving, however slowly, it\u2019s not far-fetched to imagine that the results of those outstanding lawsuits could lead to further change.\nJason Del Rey\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\nThe rest of today\u2019s Data Sheet was written by David Meyer.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Layoffs, abusive calls, and AI fears: Inside the front lines of Amazon\u2019s \u2018customer obsession\u2019 promise",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "The bad news blindsided Amazon customer service employees across the globe in mid-May: More layoffs had arrived. This time, it was middle managers.\nIn one Amazon office in Europe, a senior customer service official informed employees during a group meeting that a restructuring would remove an entire level of middle management, but since he refrained from using words like \u201clayoffs,\u201d it wasn\u2019t initially clear whether impacted employees would be out of a job completely or simply reassigned. As employees exchanged puzzled looks trying to decipher what exactly was transpiring, they finally realized that some in attendance had effectively just been laid off.\n\u201cIn the end, we only barely understood that my colleague next to me was fired,\u201d one longtime Amazon customer service manager told Fortune. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt that embarrassed.\u201d\nAround the same time in other parts of the world, some longtime managers tried to log into their Amazon computer system unsuccessfully. In at least one instance, a manager contacted the company\u2019s IT department for assistance only to learn that they should expect outreach from HR instead. Other managers returned to their computers after being bushwhacked by news of their fate to find that there would be no goodbyes: The company had already locked them out of their systems.\nThe bare-knuckled job cuts are just one of the many rounds of layoffs made by tech businesses over the past two years, as companies like Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and Salesforce retrench from a pandemic-fueled hiring spree. At Amazon, tens of thousands of workers across the company have been let go since the fall of 2022, a business practice that some insiders say has become more common since Andy Jassy replaced Jeff Bezos as CEO.\nFor Amazon\u2019s customer service ranks\u2014the frontline staff at a nearly $2 trillion business that proudly markets itself as \u201ccustomer-obsessed\u201d\u2014the layoffs carry a special significance. At a time when remote work and cost-cutting have upended established work patterns, and with the first wave of generative AI threatening to reshape the very nature of many professions, the plight of Amazon\u2019s customer service managers offers what could be a preview of broader changes coming to corporate workforces around the world.\nAlready, the question of what comes next for this division at Amazon is dominating side conversations and text threads between Amazon employees in call centers and virtual offices from the U.S. to Costa Rica to India. Will Amazon continue to outsource even more customer interactions to third-party firms? Are current employees unknowingly training an AI replacement under the guise of a new software tool that management is forcing them to use? How far off is complete automation of their roles?\nFortune spoke to a dozen Amazon customer service employees and managers, all of whom requested anonymity either because Amazon policies prohibit them from speaking to the press without permission or because they don\u2019t want to risk losing out on severance that the company is offering them. Throughout the conversations, one common theme emerged: The workers believe the future of their work is more tenuous than it was yesterday and more difficult than ever before.\nAmazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan told Fortune that business leaders and teams are empowered to make their own staffing and investment decisions, and that leadership has been managing through an unprecedented series of events, including the global pandemic and the resulting unpredictable shifts in consumer demand and the labor market.\nWhen Fortune told Amazon that Amazon employees and managers\u00a0estimate that anywhere between a couple hundred and 600 roles were recently eliminated, the spokesperson would only confirm that more than 100 positions were cut.\nIn the U.S., Amazon provided 60 days of pay and benefits to the customer service managers who were recently laid off, plus severance. Some may be reassigned to another Amazon role if there\u2019s a fit elsewhere in the company, and Amazon said that\u2019s already occurred in some instances.\u00a0In the case of the European layoffs, Amazon said it was required in some countries to notify staff in a group setting that a restructuring may involve roles being eliminated, but contended that employees wouldn't have learned there which specific positions were being axed.\nIn a statement, Callahan said that the opinions and anecdotes of the 12 employees who spoke to Fortune \u201cdo not match the data\u201d that Amazon gleans from the thousands of customer service employees it regularly surveys. \u201cOverall, the majority of our frontline customer service employees report having high job satisfaction, and in fact, it is up this year versus last,\u201d she said.\nWithin the vast universe of Amazon workers, which totaled 1.5 million full- and part-time employees at the end of March, customer service representatives inhabit a curious middle zone\u2014not exactly fitting within the ranks of the warehouse workers and delivery drivers, nor entirely within the corporate realm of engineers, salespeople, and other office folks.\nThe Amazon managers who were laid off are salaried employees who might make somewhere between $60,000 and $80,000 a year in the U.S in base pay if they were promoted internally. (Amazon\u2019s spokesperson said that range is below the average, but declined to provide more detail.) They aren\u2019t paid overtime but have job commitments that could at times necessitate working 50 to 60 hours a week, employees told Fortune. They are also eligible to earn some Amazon stock based on their performance, as well as part of their regular compensation package.\nAt the lower level, Amazon customer service agents, or CSAs, get paid hourly (from just north of $15 to a couple of dollars over $20 in the U.S.) to respond by phone, email, chat, and social to questions and complaints from shoppers and Amazon device users when online self-service tools don't suffice. While some agents work out of call centers, many work remotely from home. In 2022, Amazon moved more employees from call centers to remote positions, reportedly to save money on real estate costs. Amazon also outsources some customer service work to third-party companies, employees said.\nDespite Amazon\u2019s longtime tenet that it \u201cstrives to be Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company,\u201d the common feeling among customer service employees, however long they have worked at the company, is not so warm and fuzzy. \u201cWe are the low-level guys, the ones who cost something,\u201d said one longtime customer service manager.\n\u201cWe definitely are seen as a cost to the company and that\u2019s something that they remind us of often,\u201d said a longtime manager laid off recently.\nAs with most things at Amazon, customer service teams operate in a culture of thrift and efficiency (even at its corporate offices, Amazon\u2019s idea of employee perks leans more toward free bananas than the complimentary gourmet food found at Google). In recent years, however, the push to squeeze costs out of the customer service team has been more pronounced, sources said. All customer service managers and employees who spoke to Fortune said that the already small budgets for rewarding agents with modest gift cards or swag have been slashed or eliminated over the last few years.\n\u201cThey have cut down all our engagement budgets,\u201d one said: \u201ceverything related to improve a team's morale, relieve stress, make them feel like they belong to the company.\u201d\nAn Amazon spokesperson disputed that \u201cengagement\u201d budgets have been cut despite claims to the contrary from frontline agents as well as managers with direct knowledge of such budgeting.\nAmazon previously told Fortune that the restructuring was intended to help shrink the gap between higher levels of management and customers. But some managers and frontline agents who spoke to Fortune expressed concern about how much the workloads of the remaining managers will increase, and how customer escalations from frontline agents might get lost in the shuffle.\nThe cutbacks have come at the same time that Amazon has made it more difficult for customer service agents to provide concessions to customers as easily as they once did, according to employees, some of whom also say that scammers, and customers who have been the victims of scammers, have grown alongside Amazon\u2019s sales. Customers who abuse Amazon return policies may also be partly to blame.\nThe upshot for Amazon customer service employees is that accomplishing day-to-day tasks is more challenging, and often accompanied by abuse.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve become so restrictive and set on frugality that it\u2019s become an uphill climb for even a reasonable customer to get help,\u201d one longtime manager said.\nWhile Amazon helped create the expectation of free returns for the e-commerce industry, the company\u2019s returns process can be at times friction-filled, and employees say it has gotten worse. \u201cIt\u2019s just not the customer service that people once knew Amazon for,\u201d one said.\nLongtime employees say this cost-focused environment\u00a0has exacerbated what some consider to be a mental health crisis among Amazon\u2019s CS agents. They say a dramatic shift began during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when customers who were bound by stay-at-home orders began spewing the type of vitriol at phone agents that they\u2019d never consider unleashing face to face.\nCustomers wishing rape or death on Amazon customer service employees is now not unheard-of. Diatribes laced with profanity have become more of the norm.\n\u201cThe amount of coworkers who\u2019ve told me something like, \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019d step in front of a bus but I probably wouldn\u2019t move if one was coming,\u2019 is high,\u201d one longtime Amazon employee said.\nManagers have taken notice.\n\u201cI am very concerned about the mental health of people who report to me and the stress they are under,\u201d one longtime customer service manager told Fortune.\nAmazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan said the company cares \u201cdeeply about our employee experience and works hard to continually improve it.\u201d\u00a0She added that Amazon has programs and resources in place for employees who deal with a \u201cdifficult\u201d or abusive interaction, and that CSAs can terminate a customer conversation if a warning doesn\u2019t curb the customer\u2019s behavior. Amazon may also subsequently suspend or ban these customers.\nAmazon also disputed claims from longtime employees and managers that it is harder for them to provide customer concessions than in the past, but noted that the company has worked over the past two years to more consistently apply its concessions policies in different markets around the world.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not perfect, and when mistakes occur, we\u2019re not only diligent to remediate it with our customer, but we also use the situation as a learning opportunity that fuels continuous improvement to our tools, processes, and policies,\u201d Amazon\u2019s Callahan said.\nWhile some of these issues have percolated for years, a newer one is causing significant strife throughout Amazon\u2019s customer service operation\u2014and AI fears are partly to blame. Recently, Amazon leaders have mandated that customer service agents exclusively use a new internal software tool to resolve customer issues. The software program, known as AC3, has been in development for years, but only recently has access to the previous tool been cut off.\nThe first issue with the program, according to frontline employees and managers alike, is that the tool is slow and full of bugs, with some agents telling Fortune that it can extend customer interactions by two to three times the previous average. Whereas the old tool used to easily allow an agent to browse a customer\u2019s Amazon history, the tool now mainly prompts employees to follow a Q&A process.\nIn a role where efficiency goals are stressed, the software hiccups are anxiety-inducing for frontline reps. Consistently missing these goals can affect job security and promotion eligibility, employees told Fortune. Even one manager who believes the tool holds great promise admits it was rolled out before it was ready for prime time.\n\u201cIt is defective,\u201d the manager said.\nThe tool has also severely limited the amount of customer information and purchase history that Amazon customer service agents can access, employees told Fortune. While several managers said limiting access could be a win for customer privacy, they also admitted it often makes resolving issues much more complicated and could actually end up benefiting customers with a history of abusing Amazon\u2019s return policies because representatives are effectively blind to useful, historical context. Several employees described their work as attempting to help customers with a hand tied behind their back.\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the company continues to invest in tools to improve both the customer and employee experience, and uses feedback to improve.\nTo make matters worse, some employees also fear that the software tool is designed in such a way that they are essentially helping train their AI replacement. A new structured Q&A flow that agents are now required to follow has struck some workers as an odd, and largely unnecessary, process for their routine interactions with customers. Another possible clue, according to one employee: After an agent resolves a refund issue for a customer using AC3, the final messaging on the screen is written as if a customer is viewing it, not an agent.\n\u201cIt was employee-facing before and now it\u2019s customer-facing,\u201d one customer service employee said. \u201cIt was almost like the customer could do this themselves.\u201d\nAnother current longtime customer service manager claimed to Fortune that their superior has confirmed as much.\n\u201cIt learns,\u201d the longtime manager said of the software. \u201cWe are training AI. It\u2019s not speculation.\u201d\nThe Amazon spokesperson did not offer a comment on the idea that employees are training AI through the tool.\nConsidering the AI hype cycle currently dominating the business world, no one should blame customer service agents for thinking the worst. The company\u2019s Amazon Web Services division, after all, is currently marketing its own AI chatbot service specifically to call centers. These fears are not materializing out of thin air.\nFrom the most recent layoffs, to the stress and verbal abuse they encounter regularly, to their dissatisfaction with the new work tool, Amazon customer service employees are wondering whether company executives are even aware of their plight\u2014and whether they should still be able to boast of customer obsession with a straight face.\n\u201cI was excited to join the company years ago,\u201d one longtime manager told Fortune. \u201cI thought we were revolutionary at the time.\u201d\n\u201cNow,\u201d they added, \u201cwe are exactly the same as anyone else.\u201d\nAre you a current or former Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "Author": "  CHRISTOPHER WEBER ",
        "Text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 California has fined Amazon a total of $5.9 million, alleging the e-commerce giant worked warehouse employees so hard that it put their safety at risk, officials said Tuesday.\nThe two citations issued in May by the California Labor Commissioner\u2019s Office said Amazon.com Services LLC ran afoul of the state's Warehouse Quota Law at facilities in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, east of Los Angeles.\nThe law, which took effect in 2022, \u201crequires warehouse employers to provide employees written notice of any quotas they must follow, including the number of tasks they need to perform per hour and any discipline that could come\u201d from not meeting the requirements, the labor commissioner's office said in a statement.\nAmazon was fined $1.2 million at a warehouse in Redlands and $4.7 million at another in nearby Moreno Valley.\nThe company said Tuesday that it disagrees with the allegations and has appealed the citations.\n\u201cThe truth is, we don\u2019t have fixed quotas. At Amazon, individual performance is evaluated over a long period of time, in relation to how the entire site\u2019s team is performing,\u201d company spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel said in a statement. \u201cEmployees can \u2014 and are encouraged to \u2014 review their performance whenever they wish. They can always talk to a manager if they\u2019re having trouble finding the information.\u201d\nThe citations allege that Amazon failed to provide written notice of quotas.\nLabor Commissioner Lilia Garc\u00eda-Brower said Amazon engaged in \u201cexactly the kind of system\u201d that the quotas law was put in place to prevent.\n\u201cUndisclosed quotas expose workers to increased pressure to work faster and can lead to higher injury rates and other violations by forcing workers to skip breaks,\u201d she said in a statement.\nThe agency began investigating in 2022 after employees at the two Southern California facilities reported that they were subject to unfair quota practices, said the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, a nonprofit that advocates for improving working conditions.\nSimilar legislation has been enacted in Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Washington, the resource center said. In May, U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, introduced a federal version of the warehouse worker protection act in Congress.\n"

        "Author": "  Meghan Hall ",
        "Text": "Amazon\u2018s practices around data and algorithms may have Prime-d it for legal trouble\u2014again.\nThe British Independent Retailers Association (BIRA) brought the \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion) claim against the e-commerce giant Thursday, alleging that it illegally misused British retailers\u2019 data to furnish its own profits. BIRA filed the action with the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) in London.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nSenators Admonish Amazon for 'Evasive' Response to DSP Program Inquiry\nWhat the Teamsters Team-up Means for the Amazon Labor Union\nAmazon Joins Worker Safety Program. But Is It Enough?\nAccording to BIRA, Amazon has used \u201cdata that is non-public and belongs solely and specifically to the retailers\u201d selling on its UK marketplace to help the company determine which new product areas it should enter to turn more profits. That, the organization contends, is based on information like earnings and sales potential, how to out-price existing offerings and more.\nBIRA says that once Amazon has used retailers\u2019 proprietary data to add products into its sprawling assortment it then uses the Buy Box function to promote its own offerings to consumers at lower prices than existing listings.\nThe Buy Box is coveted real estate on Amazon, because it\u2019s where the vast majority of sales come from. Amazon\u2019s algorithms select one seller\u2019s listing for a product to promote above the others, based on a variety of considerations.\n\u201cBy misusing their proprietary data to bring to market rival products that are sold cheaper, Amazon is effectively pushing many of the UK\u2019s independent retailers out of the market,\u201d the organization said. \u201cThe consequences of Amazon\u2019s abusive conduct has been to inflate its profits and harm the UK retail sector, especially the smaller independent retailers who are struggling at a time of difficult economic circumstances.\u201d\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the company believes the claims outlined are untrue.\n\u201cWe have not seen this complaint, but based on the reporting so far we are confident that it is baseless and that this will be exposed in the legal process,\u201d the spokesperson told Sourcing Journal in a statement. \u201cOver 100,000 small and medium sized businesses in the UK sell on Amazon\u2019s store, more than half of all physical product sales on our UK store are from independent selling partners and the fact is that we only succeed when the businesses we work with succeed.\u201d\nBIRA\u2019s allegations are far from the first. In 2022, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an investigation into the company, stating that it had taken advantage of its position in the market by favoring its own services over third-party sellers on the marketplace. Amazon made an agreement with the CMA to freeze the probe. The company did the same with the European Commission when pressed.\nSimilarly, the U.S.\u2019s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought a lawsuit against Amazon, backed by 17 state attorneys, general, alleging that the company \u201cuses a set of interlocking anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power\u201d and squanches the hopes of other sellers trying to earn profit on the marketplace side of the business.\nGovernments and retailers aren\u2019t the only ones scrutinizing Bezos\u2019 baby. In February, U.S. consumers brought a class-action lawsuit against Amazon, alleging that it exercises too much control over the Buy Box, \u201cnudge or trick [consumers] into purchasing higher-priced offers despite the availability of lower-priced offers for the same product with equal or better estimated delivery times.\u201d\nAccording to BIRA, the collective action claim is the largest to be filed under the UK\u2019s Competition Act of 1998.\nA collective action functions similarly to a class action in the United States, but the main difference is that, in a collective action, afflicted parties have to opt in to participating; in a class action, parties have to opt out if they do not want to be included. BIRA estimates that about 35,000 retailers in the UK could be eligible to participate in this particular action.\nMany of those retailers are small businesses, it claims. No matter the size of the retailer, though, Amazon charges a 30 percent commission on products sold through the site, BIRA said.\nAlready, that docks the profit retailers can turn on the marketplace, which may seem like a necessary evil to retailers who would miss out on making sales if they migrated off of Amazon, said Andrew Goodacre, BIRA\u2019s chief executive.\n\u201cOne might ask, why would an independent retailer use Amazon if it is so damaging to their business? In reality, we have seen a significant shift in consumer buying behavior and, if small business[es] want to sell online, Amazon is the dominant marketplace in the UK,\u201d Goodacre said.\nThe claim could be retribution for what the retailers allege is scheme-heavy conduct from the Prime purveyor. Goodacre said he hopes that, through this action\u2014which will need to be authorized to proceed by the CAT\u2014retailers can reclaim the damages they deserve.\n\u201cThe British public has a strong relationship with its local, independent retailers, and ensuring they are not put out business by Amazon\u2019s illegal actions is a key driving force behind this collective action. The filing of the claim today is the first step toward retailers obtaining compensation for what Amazon has done,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI am confident that the CAT will authorize the claim to go forward, and I look forward to the opportunity to present the case on behalf of UK retailers. This is a watershed moment for UK retailers, but especially for small independent retailers in this country.\u201d\n"

        "Author": "  Daniel Wiessner ",
        "Text": "By Daniel Wiessner\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com has been fined $5.9 million by a California labor regulator who says the online retail giant failed to properly inform workers of productivity quotas at two warehouses, including one where some workers are trying to unionize.\nThe office of California Labor Commissioner Lilia Garcia-Brower announced the fines, which were issued in May, on Tuesday.\nA 2022 California law requires employers to provide written descriptions of quotas to workers if they can be disciplined for failing to complete jobs at a specified speed. The commissioner said Amazon violated that law nearly 60,000 times in a five-month period ending in March at massive warehouses in Moreno Valley and Redlands, outside of Los Angeles.\nAmazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel said the company is appealing the citations and denied that warehouse workers have fixed quotas.\n\"At Amazon, individual performance is evaluated over a long period of time, in relation to how the entire site\u2019s team is performing. Employees can \u2013 and are encouraged to \u2013 review their performance whenever they wish,\" Lynch Vogel said in a statement.\nCriticisms of Amazon's alleged quota system have been a focal point of a nationwide campaign to unionize its warehouses. Workers at a New York City warehouse voted to join a union in 2022, while others at two facilities in New York and Alabama have since spurned unions.\nA union in 2022 filed a petition to hold an election at the Moreno Valley warehouse, known as ONT8, which was later withdrawn amid allegations of illegal union-busting activity by Amazon. An administrative judge is scheduled to hold a hearing on those claims, which Amazon has denied, in August.\nGarcia-Brower in a statement said Amazon's quota system is exactly what the California law was designed to prevent.\n\"Undisclosed quotas expose workers to increased pressure to work faster and can lead to higher injury rates and other violations by forcing workers to skip breaks,\" she said.\nCongress is considering a Democratic-backed bill that would largely mirror the California law by requiring written notice of quotas and prohibiting quotas that prevent workers from taking breaks or using bathrooms.\nSenator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, one of the bill's sponsors, said the fines against Amazon announced on Tuesday highlighted the need to crack down on \"punishing\" quota systems.\n\"We need more than a patchwork of state laws,\" Markey said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Rod Nickel)\n"

        "Title": "Amazon often says its employees are satisfied. Workers explain why you should question the data",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Thirty years after its founding, Amazon has grown into one of the largest employers in the world and the second-largest corporation in the U.S. by staff size, trailing only Walmart. It\u2019s also one of the most admired.\nAlong the way, the company has invested in programs for its massive, 1.5-million-employee workforce\u2014spread across warehouses and offices around the world\u2014to provide regular feedback on their work experience, including a daily survey tool known as Connections.\nWhile the results from Connections surveys are meant to identify problem areas (or problem managers) and seek solutions\u2014\u201cOur goal is to help develop leaders who earn trust, remove barriers to excellence, and make Amazon an inspiring place to work\u201d\u2014Amazon has also utilized Connections data when combating public reports of dissatisfied employees.\nAnd when it does, employees have for years been known to reach out to this reporter with a suggestion: Be skeptical of the data.\nMost recently, Amazon cited its employee survey results in response to a Fortune article documenting the challenges and fears facing Amazon\u2019s customer service employees. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also cited Connections data from warehouse staff when he addressed unionization efforts in his final annual shareholder letter as CEO.\nTo be clear, many Amazon employees note that Connections appears well-intentioned, and some who\u2019ve worked on the program have lauded it as one of the first large-scale experiments involving a company creating a daily employee survey.\nStill, many Amazon employees question the accuracy of the feedback\u2014and thus the data Amazon cites\u2014because they say many workers don\u2019t answer Connections questions honestly.\nThe reasons for this are numerous, employees have said. Chief among employee concerns is that the anonymity of their responses is not as bulletproof as the company would like to suggest. On small teams for example, employees are concerned that their manager can deduce who responded in what way based on the overall manager-employee relationship. Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan said employee responses are confidential and that managers see aggregated results only when a team has at least four employees. For smaller teams, survey responses are not visible to managers nor other leaders. But even team sizes of four or more can leave little cover for who answered how, employees argue.\nAnd some managers go so far as to put a thumb on the scale, employees say, by coaching their direct reports on how to answer certain questions or stressing to them that negative feedback can negatively impact the manager\u2019s standing.\n\u201cRather than self-reflection on why her scores are low,\u201d one Amazon employee told Fortune of a manager, \u201cshe regularly bullies us to give better scores.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s Callahan said it\u2019s against company policy for managers to attempt to influence employee responses, and that employees can always choose not to answer Connections questions if they prefer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly working to improve the experience of our employees, and that\u2019s why we collect feedback daily through Connections,\u201d she noted in a statement to Fortune. \u201cEmployees can choose whether to answer or not, their responses are always confidential and aggregated, and the feedback that leaders receive help them build stronger organizations. We hear from the vast majority of our team that it\u2019s a useful tool, and the anecdotes that were shared with us for this story don\u2019t reflect most people\u2019s experiences.\u201d\nCallahan added that the daily frequency of the surveying allows managers to filter results for various time frames and view trends for several questions that the tool asks regularly over a period of time. In its ideal implementation, the data allows managers to alleviate problems more quickly than if the company only polled workers monthly or annually.\nOn the other side of the equation, some employees have said they don\u2019t give candid feedback because they fear a manager whom they like or respect will be penalized for employee concerns that are outside of the manager\u2019s control.\nEither way, the next time Amazon cites survey data to paint a picture of its work environment, it\u2019s worth at least noting what many employees believe: that the picture is far from complete.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: Nvidia vs. Amazon",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Whether you're a casual investor or trade professionally, you're likely aware of the boom in the artificial intelligence (AI) market that has captivated Wall Street over the last year. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT toward the end of 2022 reinvigorated the industry and led countless companies to pivot their businesses toward AI.\nExcitement over the generative technology has led to companies across tech enjoying significant stock growth. Notable are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which have seen their share prices soar 222% and 45%, respectively, since last June. These companies have achieved powerful positions in AI, with one leading the chip market and the other excelling in software.\nDespite recent growth, these companies likely still have much more to offer new investors, with the AI market projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030.\nSo, let's take a closer look at these tech giants and determine whether Nvidia or Amazon is the better stock to invest in AI this June.\nAfter soaring growth over the last year, Nvidia introduced a 10-for-1 stock split on June 10. The split has lowered its price per share, making now an attractive time to buy -- and multiple analysts seem to agree.\nArgus Research and Oppenheimer recently increased their price targets from $110 per share to $150, maintaining a buy rating. Meanwhile, Evercore ISI raised its target to $145 from $131, expressing a similar sentiment.\nDespite delivering record gains, Nvidia's powerful position in AI and tech in general indicates it's still nowhere near hitting its ceiling. The company maintains an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the chips necessary to train AI models. Meanwhile, chip demand is expected to rise for the foreseeable future as the AI market develops.\nMoreover, Nvidia is keeping up with the demand for powerful hardware and retaining its lead among competitors by making a change to its product release schedule. The company will now design new chips yearly rather than every two years, like was once customary.\nThe move has forced rivals like AMD to do the same. However, with $39 billion in free cash flow compared to AMD's just over $1 billion, Nvidia is better equipped to retain its lead in AI and keep investing in its business.\nLike Nvidia, Amazon is leading its respective area of AI. The company is home to the world's largest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, which outperforms competitors Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud in market share.\nAs a result, Amazon has been able to leverage its extensive list of clientele to tout its AI products and get ahead in the industry. The company's success was evident in recent quarterly earnings. In the first quarter of 2024, AWS posted revenue growth of 17% year over year, with operating income soaring 84%. The segment has quickly become the most lucrative part of Amazon's business, responsible for 60% of its operating income.\nConsequently, Amazon is investing billions into expanding AWS' reach and building data centers in multiple countries, including Taiwan and India. Meanwhile, AWS has ventured into chip design, announcing its Trainium2 chips last year, built specifically for training AI models.\nAmazon's free cash flow has soared more than 1,000% since last June, while its operating income has increased by 99%. The figures highlight the reliability of Amazon's business and prove it has the financial resources to go far in AI.\nNvidia and Amazon have delivered stellar gains thanks to AI, but they are likely not done yet. These companies continue to have massive growth potential in the industry and would likely prove to be assets to any portfolio over the long term. As a result, it could be a good idea to consider their valuations when determining which is the better buy.\nThis chart shows Amazon's stock is trading at a bargain compared to Nvidia's, with a lower price-to-sales and forward price-to-earnings ratio. In addition to a promising position in AI, Amazon is a no-brainer over Nvidia right now. However, it's still worth keeping an eye on Nvidia and investing when the time is right.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Walmart CEO Doug McMillon keeps fending off Amazon for the top spot on the Fortune 500. Can he and the mega-retailer continue their streak?",
        "Author": "  Phil Wahba ",
        "Text": "On an April morning at Walmart\u2019s headquarters, Doug McMillon was getting the Ryan Gosling treatment.\nThe occasion was a meeting to celebrate about 150 of Walmart\u2019s long-tenured employees; the giant retailer holds a few such gatherings every year at its campus in Bentonville, Ark. The employees, whose badges identified them by years of service\u201420, 30, even 50\u2014were the honorees. But McMillon was the one being mobbed like a movie star, as coworkers rushed up to ask for autographs or get a selfie with their photogenic CEO.\nMcMillon, at 6-foot-2, was easy to spot, and it took a while for him to work the room. When he finally hit the stage, he invited the guest-of-honor cashiers, forklift drivers, and merchants to share stories about their decades at the company. He also invited them to register complaints if so inclined. \u201cIf you want to ask for anything, now is a good time,\u201d McMillon joked. And some did just that. One asked for the company to provide health insurance for retirees. Another called for more predictable scheduling, citing the pain that variable hours can cause for parents and caregivers. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can make it better,\u201d McMillon said softly; later, he instructed Walmart\u2019s head of U.S. stores to look into the matter.\nMcMillon, 57, has an approachability that would make any politician jealous, a gift for holding eye contact and making an interlocutor feel like they\u2019re the only person in the universe. And in his 10 years as leader of America\u2019s largest company, he\u2019s needed every iota of it. McMillon took the reins in 2014 with a mandate to reinvent a tradition-bound giant whose sales had grown stagnant, a retailer facing obsolescence in the face of the e-commerce revolution. It has taken diplomacy, empathy, and persistence to rally managers and rank-and-file workers worldwide around a new approach to their jobs.\nHe admits he may have underestimated the scale of the task. \u201cI didn\u2019t anticipate how much change needed to happen in the way we think and work, in learning to make decisions differently,\u201d McMillon tells Fortune during a conversation in his office, just after the employee pep rally.\nBy many measures, McMillon has risen to the challenge. Walmart has ranked No.\u00a01 on the Fortune\u00a0500 list of America\u2019s biggest companies for McMillon\u2019s entire tenure as CEO (and for 12 years in a row). Last year the company had annual revenue of $648\u00a0billion\u2014a stunning $162\u00a0billion more than it generated the year McMillon took over. In the fiscal year ended Jan.\u00a031, Walmart also passed the $100\u00a0billion mark in global e-commerce revenue, demonstrating its strength on retail\u2019s most important battlefield. What\u2019s more, a chain that\u2019s synonymous with \u201ccheap\u201d is winning more middle- and upper-income customers, thanks in part to spruced-up stores with wider selections of everything from sneakers to baby spinach.\nMaking these changes required McMillon\u2014a Walmart lifer, with 33 years under his belt\u2014to reimagine what it means to lead 2.1\u00a0million \u201cassociates\u201d (as Walmart calls its employees). He\u2019s given subordinates more freedom to innovate. And he has fought to change Walmart\u2019s image as an employer, from that of a tightfisted miser to one that pays frontline workers more competitively and offers a welcoming environment for techies and executives.\nThe work is far from done, and more obstacles loom. Walmart now faces the challenge of slowing sales growth as consumer demand weakens, and it announced in mid-May that it would lay off some corporate staffers. But overall, McMillon sounds pleased with the progress. \u201cThe pieces are finally coming together,\u201d he says of his strategy. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on these pieces for a long time.\u201d\nIt\u2019s virtually impossible to spend time in Bentonville without encountering reverential references to Sam Walton, who founded Walmart in 1962. Walton\u2019s company became America\u2019s dominant retailer by focusing on frugality bordering on austerity, under the banner of an \u201cEvery Day Low Price\u201d philosophy. (The Sam\u2019s Club warehouse-store chain, founded in 1983 to battle Costco, and Walmart International, which took off in the 1990s, built further on Walton\u2019s legacy.)\nEven today, 32 years after his death, \u201cMr. Sam\u201d is constantly invoked in Walmart meetings and gatherings. Indeed, three associates who were feted at the meeting that McMillon hosted either mentioned or quoted Walton; a 50-year veteran named Theresa called him \u201cthe ultimate disrupter.\u201d Visitors from outside the company can watch and listen to a slightly unnerving Walton hologram at the Walmart Museum Heritage Lab downtown\u2014or even visit his grave, a half-mile from headquarters.\nMcMillon\u2019s own history with Walmart dates to 1984, after his father, a dentist, moved the family to Bentonville from Jonesboro, Ark. The teenage Doug\u2019s first Walmart job was unloading trucks at a warehouse. His other choice for a summer job was McDonald\u2019s, but Walmart paid far better, at $6.50 per hour. Later, while at business school at the University of Tulsa, he entered Walmart\u2019s training program for \u201cbuyers,\u201d managers who choose what items their stores will stock. (The first product McMillon oversaw as a buyer: fishing tackle.)\nThe buyers program is one of Walmart\u2019s entry points for grooming high-potential management candidates. McMillon lived up to that potential, eventually serving stints as CEO of Sam\u2019s Club and of Walmart International. At 47, he became the fifth chief executive in Walmart\u2019s history, and the youngest other than Walton himself. He occupies an office that once belonged to\u2014of course\u2014Mr. Sam; its Nixon-era wood paneling and parking-lot views speak to the founder\u2019s disdain for frills.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t celebrate Sam and talk about him for nostalgic reasons,\u201d McMillon says. \u201cSam had a set of beliefs that generated success, and those principles are relevant today.\u201d\nStill, by the time McMillon became CEO, there were signs that the company had strayed from some of those beliefs, while taking others too far.\nWalton had always railed against creeping bureaucracy. When he visited stores, he famously would speak much more with frontline workers than with managers; he often praised any \u201crogue merchant\u201d who did right by the customer even if they deviated from their boss\u2019s protocols. Yet by 2014, Walmart had grown so large that bureaucracy had set in, and different teams worked in silos. A fixation on keeping costs low left the company struggling to invest in innovation, making it ill-equipped to serve consumers drawn to the affordability and convenience of Amazon. Same-store sales at Walmart U.S., which generates some 69% of overall company revenue, were oscillating between anemic growth and small declines\u2014a clear signal that Walmart was falling short of Mr. Sam\u2019s ideals about keeping the customer\u2019s wishes paramount.\nMcMillon recalls his predecessor, Mike Duke, boiling down his mission to a pithy phrase: \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to do this differently.\u201d The challenge: modernizing Walmart\u2019s practice without abandoning its low-price ethos.\n1\nThe most urgent area for modernization, of course, was e-commerce. Early on, McMillon sent a clear message: He would let his subordinates experiment, and even face-plant, in the search for innovative solutions. The idea was to adopt the \u201cfail fast\u201d approach that had propelled Walmart\u2019s e-commerce rivals. His efforts quickly multiplied: Walmart bought retailer Jet.com in 2016 in a $3\u00a0billion megadeal and lined up its founder, Marc Lore, as its e-commerce head\u2014a vital acqui-hire. Walmart also acquired digital-native consumer brands like men\u2019s clothier Bonobos and outdoor gear-and-attire retailer Moosejaw.\nProgress was slow, and many of the acquisitions were later wound down or sold off. Jet.com closed in 2020, and Lore left Walmart in 2021. But McMillon says working with digital-first brands and executives helped give Walmart staff a sense of daring, while speeding up their tech metabolism. Lessons learned from its acquisitions helped Walmart build a faster payments platform, for example, along with a more user-friendly way for customers to manage prescriptions at its pharmacies.\nAbove all, McMillon helped Walmart find its e-commerce sweet spot in its strongest existing asset: its fleet of 4,600 stores. An estimated 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart store, which gave the company a head start on building a network of e-commerce fulfillment hubs. As Walmart.com scaled up, it was quickly able to narrow the gap with Amazon on speed as well as price.\nIn 2023, Walmart posted $65.4\u00a0billion in U.S. e-commerce sales, more than quadruple its 2019 total. Today, McMillon can allow himself a victory lap. \u201cIt\u2019s fun when the world tries to condemn a failure, and inside, you just smile and say, \u2018We were learning,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cIt strengthened the company, and the hits are outweighing the losses.\u201d\nMost of Walmart\u2019s revenue still comes through stores, and here, too, McMillon prompted major rethinking\u2014and gave deputies lots of leeway. Greg Foran, McMillon\u2019s top U.S. lieutenant from 2014 until 2019, helped turn Walmart\u2019s largely drab stores into far more appealing emporiums. Walmart grocery sections still sell bulk bargains, but they increasingly showcase the kinds of fresh produce and deli counters that middle-class shoppers flock to.\nThe same treatment extends into the apparel and general-merchandise aisles: On a store visit to a Walmart in Springdale, Ark., in April, one could find Levi\u2019s and Reebok featured in \u201cvignette\u201d displays and on mannequins\u2014the kind of \u201cvisual merchandising\u201d associated with department stores and specialty retailers\u2014rather than simply stacked up high on shelves. The wine section even boasted a Cabernet Sauvignon from the upscale California winery Caymus Vineyards, for $85 a bottle.\nMcMillon\u2019s team hasn\u2019t quite been able to turn the company into an \u201ceverything store\u201d where people go for an array of services outside of shopping. In April, for example, the company announced it was shutting down its Walmart Health clinics, as well as its telehealth arm. But \u201ccomp\u201d sales at U.S. stores have exceeded 2% growth every year since 2016\u2014an unusually good run for a mass retailer.\nMcMillon says he visits Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club stores in the U.S. and abroad one week a month. He\u2019s not there to micromanage his managers, he says, but to make sure stores are up to Walmart\u2019s new, higher standards.\nInvestor stability has been key to Walmart\u2019s progress. McMillon has had an ally and guide in Greg Penner, a venture and private equity investor who became Walmart\u2019s chairman the year after McMillon became CEO. A former Walmart employee from its early e-commerce days, Penner married into the Walton family, which owns close to half of Walmart\u2019s shares. Several times during the 2010s, McMillon announced plans for big e-commerce investments and increases in wages that were aimed at improving Walmart\u2019s service and digital firepower\u2014but would dent profits in the short run. Predictably, commentators fumed, and the retailer\u2019s shares stumbled. But McMillon\u2019s close coordination with the Waltons meant the wrath of Wall Street didn\u2019t knock Walmart off course. \nWhen his changes draw criticism, McMillon thinks back on one of his predecessors. David Glass, the first CEO to succeed Sam Walton, was under intense scrutiny, and critics accused him of trying to change Walmart too much by entering the grocery business. Today, groceries account for 60% of Walmart\u2019s sales. On his office bookshelf, McMillon keeps a copy of a 1996 issue of Fortune that includes a piece questioning Glass\u2019s strategy. At the end of our interview, he cheerfully shows off the magazine, not unlike a winning athlete pointing to the scoreboard. \u201cWhat would our revenue be now,\u201d he says of Glass, \u201cif he hadn\u2019t done those things?\u201d\nPhysically, at least, there\u2019s no bigger symbol of McMillon\u2019s modernization efforts than the sprawling 350-acre construction site known as the New Home Office. Scheduled to begin a phased opening in 2025, the campus will feature the kind of eco-friendly open-plan buildings most people associate with Silicon Valley, along with bike paths, a fitness center with two large swimming pools, and outposts of hip local coffee shops.\nThe new digs have a lot more in common with, say, Apple\u2019s new headquarters than with Walmart\u2019s badly dated current home office, which opened in 1971. Like McMillon\u2019s own office, its extreme simplicity sends the message to suppliers, employees, and other stakeholders that Walmart does not waste money on frivolity. But McMillon bristles at the suggestion that the new space is over-the-top for a retailer for whom frugality is a North Star. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s splashy, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fancy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s consistent with a contemporary Walmart.\u201d And he\u2019s candid about its purpose: \u201cWe have world-class talent, and we want to keep it.\u201d\nThe company wants to keep more talent close to home, too: Over the past year, it has closed some regional hubs and relocated employees to Bentonville. Indeed, Walmart wouldn\u2019t be sitting atop the Fortune\u00a0500 if it hadn\u2019t succeeded in attracting top people: engineers to keep its e-commerce humming; merchandisers, marketers, and designers to make its stores inviting. Bentonville for years was dismissed as a backwater by many retail executives, but its population has doubled in the past 20 years, and the energy of its restaurant and nightlife scene is now more Austin than Ozark. That change reflects the people Walmart has lured to town.\nLuring them has required major cultural shifts. When McMillon took the reins in 2014, Walmart was still, for many anticorporate types, public enemy No.\u00a01\u2014best known for driving small competitors out of business and paying lamentable wages. For most of its history, Walmart had written off critics, particularly in the media, as unfair. But after Walmart earned kudos for its role in providing relief in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the company aimed to refresh the narrative. Building on the efforts of his predecessors Duke and Lee Scott, McMillon aimed to make Walmart a better citizen, in deed and in appearance.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun when the world tries to condemn a failure, and inside, you just smile and say, \u2018We were learning.\u2019\u201d\nUnder McMillon, Walmart has lifted its entry-level wage a number of times, from $9 in 2015 to $14 today, and ramped up training to create more career paths like the one that helped boost McMillon to better-paying roles. Walmart was a pioneer in paying college tuition for employees. Such efforts have been key to motivating workers and taming the high turnover that hampered customer service 10 years ago. On the sustainability front, McMillon has pushed efforts to reduce Walmart\u2019s carbon footprint. In 2017, Walmart said it would work with suppliers to eliminate one gigaton of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030; it achieved that goal this year, six years ahead of schedule.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a perfect company, but we\u2019ve done a lot of good things for the environment, for our associates, for others,\u201d says McMillon. \u201cI would just love for the reputation to match the reality.\u201d\nBuilding a contemporary Walmart has also sometimes meant reluctantly wading into the culture wars. That\u2019s a particularly perilous task for a company where some 150\u00a0million Americans shop every week, representing pretty much every demographic and political orientation in the U.S. Here, McMillon\u2019s gift for congeniality has proved helpful; he has routinely avoided grandstanding, or shaming those who disagree with him.\nIn 2015, Arkansas considered passing a so-called freedom of religion act, seen by many as opening the door to more discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. As CEO of the state\u2019s most important employer, McMillon took a low-key approach to advocating for a veto, making a statement on Twitter that the law \u201cundermined the spirit of inclusion\u201d in Arkansas. The governor ultimately signed a much-watered-down version of the bill. And in 2019, after 23 people were killed by a gunman at a Walmart in El\u00a0Paso, the company said it would stop selling handgun ammunition, and urged Congress and then-President Trump to strengthen background checks.\nOther retailers, including Target and Starbucks, have taken much more emphatic stances on such issues; both became objects of boycotts, and both have since dialed back how outspoken they are. In a \u201cgo woke, go broke\u201d era, McMillon appears to have found a balance that sends a message of inclusivity and public-mindedness without coming across as partisan.\n\u201cI don\u2019t wake up in the morning thinking about making political statements,\u201d says McMillon. \u201cI don\u2019t have an agenda other than serving people, and we want to serve everybody.\u201d But sometimes, he suggests, serving everybody requires speaking out.\nFor the moment, McMillon certainly seems to be pleasing almost everybody. Walmart\u2019s growth got a huge boost from the pandemic and has continued healthily, as its lower prices help attract inflation-weary customers. In 2020 the company launched a loyalty program \u00e0\u00a0la Amazon Prime called Walmart+; by last fall it reportedly had almost 60\u00a0million members. Walmart has also built a $3.4\u00a0billion advertising business around the data about shoppers\u2019 habits generated by its e-commerce. (The company recently bought TV maker Vizio for $2.3\u00a0billion, to support further data gathering.)\nInsiders and analysts expect McMillon to stay in place for at least two more years while Walmart preps and evaluates prospective successors. If he stays longer than that, he\u2019ll have the longest tenure of any Walmart CEO other than Mr.\u00a0Sam, who led the company for 36 years.\nThe irony is that McMillon may stick around long enough to fall out of first place on the Fortune\u00a0500. The transformation he led has revived Walmart\u2019s retail dominance. But Amazon\u2019s revenue growth continues to outpace Walmart\u2019s, in part because of its fast-growing cloud-services business; by Fortune\u2019s calculations, it\u2019s likely to eclipse its rival in total revenue within three years.\nMcMillon professes to be unfazed by that prospect. \u201cBeing first on the list also brings some disadvantages,\u201d he says with a slight grin, alluding to the idea that everybody wants to topple the king. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get better at serving customers and members every day,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019ll be true whether we\u2019re first or second.\u201d\nThis article appears in the\u00a0June/July 2024 issue\u00a0of\u00a0Fortune with the headline, \"Walmart\u2019s\u00a0Mr. Fix-It.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Peter Adams ",
        "Text": "This story was originally published on Marketing Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Marketing Dive newsletter.\nAmazon unveiled an ad-targeting solution called Ad Relevance that does not rely on cookies or other third-party identifiers via a blog post. The news was also announced as part of the company\u2019s presence at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity this week.\nAd Relevance, which is available via Amazon\u2019s demand-side platform, uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze billions of browsing, purchasing and streaming data points from across Amazon properties, matching those insights against what content a consumer is viewing in real time.\nYears in development, Ad Relevance has already been tested on Amazon\u2019s Audiences, Contextual Targeting and Performance+ offerings. Amazon boasted the product can improve addressability among previously anonymous impressions for advertisers, as well as lower CPMs by as much as 34%.\nCookie deprecation is still a work in progress, but Amazon is pushing ahead with its advances in creating an ad-targeting solution that does not rely on the types of third-party identifiers that have served as a bedrock for much of digital marketing. The e-commerce giant detailed plans for Ad Relevance at Cannes Lions, a major industry gathering that celebrates advertising creativity and has, over the years, seen more of its focus shift toward large tech platforms. Amazon also used the festival to trumpet progress with its generative AI-powered image generator for campaign assets, one piece of its strategy to bring the emerging tech to more advertisers.\nAd Relevance is supported by Amazon\u2019s access to a high volume of first-party shopper, browsing and streaming viewership data, leveraging the latest AI bells and whistles to ingest that information and quickly identify consumers who are on different stages of the path to purchase. It can serve ads across a range of devices, channels and content types, and has already been piloted on existing Amazon Ads products, including the machine learning-powered Performance+ ads that launched in March.\nEarly results showed Ad Relevance can \u201cextend addressability\u201d on up to 65% of impressions that were previously anonymous under different targeting tactics. CPMs, or the price a brand pays for every 1,000 impressions an ad receives, were lowered, while costs-per-click improved by 8.8%. Amazon said these metrics were achieved with 100% budget delivery.\nAmazon touting ID-free targeting capabilities comes as the deprecation timeline for cookies remains a moving target. Google originally planned to wind down cookies in Chrome in the second half of this year, but delayed its plans to 2025 earlier in the spring after facing regulatory hurdles and industry pushback against Privacy Sandbox, its proposed alternative.\nStill, marketers are on the hunt for viable cookie replacements and Amazon clearly sees an opportunity to further shore up an ad business that is booming. Amazon\u2019s revenue derived from advertising jumped 24% year over year to $11.82 billion in Q1, driven by demand for sponsored product ads. The company has recently introduced commercials to Prime Video, which it expects will contribute to further momentum in the months ahead.\n"

        "Text": "Visa Inc. V recently announced that it has partnered with Amazon to offer Canadian consumers the option to pay for purchases in installments using Royal Bank of Canada and Scotiabank credit cards. This new payment option aims to provide greater financial flexibility and control for online shoppers.\nThis new service from Visa is expected to meet the growing demand for flexible payment options among consumers. The company\u2019s research revealed that 58% of Canadians are interested in using installment payments. Additionally, it is projected that by the next year, nearly 25% of all global e-commerce transactions will be made using this method.\nThis buy now, pay later (BNPL) solution is expected to benefit Visa by increasing transaction volumes and enhancing customer satisfaction, which can attract more users to their platform. It also strengthens the company\u2019s position as a leader in meeting the growing demand for flexible payment options.\nBy partnering with Amazon, Visa leverages the massive online retail platform to reach a wider audience, ensuring the service's immediate adoption. As such, more issuers are expected to join the platform in the coming days. Also, the success of this partnership in Canada will position Visa to expand this service in other regions. With a presence in more than 200 countries and territories, it is well-positioned for the global expansion of this service.\nThis installment service is somewhat distinct from other BNPL solutions in the sense that it is integrated directly with credit cards issued by banks. This will allow cardholders to use their existing credit lines for installment payments. This integration can provide a more seamless and secure experience compared to standalone BNPL services.\nShares of Visa have gained 16.9% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 15.7% jump.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nVisa currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nInvestors interested in the broader Business Services space can look at some better-ranked stocks like Envestnet, Inc.

        "Author": " Madison Mills    \u00b7 Host and Reporter",
        "Text": "As artificial intelligence and machine learning roll out across virtually every sector of the economy, helping fuel the stock market to record highs, the biggest tech companies are racing to bring those efficiencies over to healthcare, a sector that spent $4.5 trillion in 2022.\nDr. Angela Shippy, a medical doctor turned executive at Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, is leading the charge for the world's biggest cloud provider. At Houston Medical Center, where Shippy previously saw patients, she now meets with hospital executives to discuss how tech can be incorporated into patient care.\n\u201cI have the opportunity to really bridge that gap between what's happening day-to-day within healthcare organizations and technology that can help them really transform and really find the solutions to any pain points that they have,\u201d Shippy said.\nShippy works directly with at least 700 healthcare providers across the country to expand their use of AWS-backed technology.\nAmong the tools are AI-powered rooms that transcribe conversations and take notes for doctors, Echo Dot devices that patients can use to order things like ice, and even virtual intensive care services, which decrease burnout in providers by allowing them to focus on patient care.\n\u201cIf we can take away those tiny administrative burdensome tasks and allow [care providers] to do what they truly love, then we know we're making it a better experience for them, and we're making it a better experience for the patient as well because they're in control,\u201d Shippy said.\nAWS is not alone in this effort. Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) said this earnings season they are investing another $16 billion in AI this year, a 31% increase from last year.\nAlthough more than half of hospitals' total operating revenue goes toward labor, the field remains challenged by labor shortages and increased patient volumes. Shippy aims to address these issues by deploying devices like Amazon Alexa to empower patients to make requests like turning a light on and off while reducing pressure on staff.\nBecause of her previous work as a healthcare provider, Shippy is uniquely positioned as fluent in both the medical and tech worlds. Prior to joining AWS, she was the chief medical and quality officer at the Memorial Hermann Health System, where she used her affinity for technology to develop a COVID-19 dashboard at the height of the pandemic.\n\"I saw the power of technology, and how it would be used to transform healthcare,\" Shippy said. \"And that's really what made coming to a role like this at AWS possible for me because I saw what that transformation could really lead to.\"\nOne example of that transformation is a virtual reality headset that projects 3D images. The AWS executive donned the headset, which allowed her to flip and turn the three-dimensional beating heart of a hypothetical patient. \u201cThis patient is having a heart attack,\u201d Shippy explained to Yahoo Finance.\nThe 3D virtual heart is among the more futuristic tools in the hospital, but Shippy sees value in tools across the spectrum of technology. That vision and her experience during the pandemic informed her decision to move from health to tech \u2014 a leap of faith for a doctor who decided her career path at just 9 years old.\n\u201cWhen ... somebody like me at 9 years old says, 'I want be a doctor. I want to help people,' that never goes away,\u201d Shippy said. \u201cBeing from an underrepresented community or being in a community where maybe healthcare isn't like what you've seen in the Texas Medical Center today, we want to close those gaps.\u201d\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest health industry news and events impacting stock prices\n"

        "Title": "15k+ Flex drivers file arbitration claims against Amazon in 3 states",
        "Author": "  Caleb Revill ",
        "Text": "A total of 15,867 Amazon Flex drivers across three states have filed arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) this week, alleging Amazon had misclassified their job roles as independent contractors rather than employees, resulting in underpaid and lost wages.\nAmazon Flex launched in 2015 as an option for gig workers to use their own vehicles to deliver small packages with the company. Drivers around the U.S. have sued Amazon on several occasions since then, alleging their job roles were misclassified.\nIn March, Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court affirmed that Flex drivers were employees, not independent contractors. FreightWaves Reporter John Kingston wrote in his article that a court in Waukesha County had ruled in favor of Amazon, which argued that its Flex drivers were independent contractors under state regulations. The Court of Appeals for Wisconsin reversed that lower court ruling and held the drivers were employees under state law.\nAttorneys Steven Tindall with Gibbs Law Group LLP and Joseph Sellers with Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC are leading the recent arbitration. Gibbs Law Group has published a website detailing the claims against Amazon.\nAn infographic on the website alleges that Amazon may owe Flex drivers for failing to pay a minimum wage for all hours worked, expenses on gas and cellphone use, overtime rates for those working more than 40 hours per week and missed meals and rest breaks.\nThe two firms filed 15,867 arbitration claims from drivers in California, Massachusetts and Illinois with AAA on Tuesday. Added with 453 previously filed claims, this totals 16,320 claims. Tindall told FreightWaves in an email that the firms are still accepting arbitration claims for people who drove for Amazon Flex in those three states, depending on some criteria including when they drove and what state they are in.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve litigated a total of 9 through to final arbitration hearing,\u201d Tindall said.\nTindall said that there is not a generally applicable deadline to file arbitration, but it depends on individual circumstances. There are also statutes of limitations for the claims that may apply, depending on when drivers drove and stopped driving for Amazon Flex. When asked what happens next, now that the claims are filed, he said that it\u2019s still early days in the process.\u201cWe suspect that the next step will be to work with AAA and Amazon\u2019s counsel to determine a plan to litigate the filed claims,\u201d Tindall said.\nShould a settlement be reached, those participating in the arbitration will be paid depending on the individual circumstances of each driver and the state in which they drove. Tindall said that different states have different claims, but in general, the longer that someone drove and the more delivery blocks that they delivered, the higher the potential damages. Although he did not say a specific amount, the Gibbs Law Group website says that they have had clients awarded thousands of dollars in previous arbitration cases.\nWhile similar to litigation, arbitration does not involve a court decision and relies on both parties and a mediator to reach a settlement agreement. If a settlement agreement isn\u2019t reached, Tindall said that the firms will litigate the claims on behalf of their clients.\nFreightWaves reached out to Amazon for comment on the ongoing arbitration.\n\u201cThe Amazon Flex program gives individuals the opportunity to set their own schedule and be their own boss, while earning competitive pay,\u201d Branden Baribeau, Amazon\u2019s media spokesperson, told FreightWaves in an emailed statement. \u201cWe hear from most of the Amazon Flex delivery partners that they love the flexibility of the program, and we\u2019re proud of the work they do on behalf of customers every day.\u201d\nBaribeau noted that Amazon Flex delivery partners sign up for delivery blocks that fit their schedule and are able to work when they want to and the vast majority of Amazon Flex delivery partners finish their delivery blocks early\nThe post 15k+ Flex drivers file arbitration claims against Amazon in 3 states appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Text": "US e-commerce giant Amazon is facing a proposed class action lawsuit for allegedly monopolising the retail market for audiobooks.\nThe lawsuit claims that this has resulted in authors overpaying for the distribution of their works.\nAuthor Christine DeMaio, who publishes under the name CD Reiss, filed the lawsuit in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, asserting that Amazon's practices violate US antitrust law.\nThe lawsuit details that for exclusive distribution, Amazon charges authors such as Reiss at least 60% of the sale price, which is set by the platform.\nFor non-exclusive titles, the fee increases to at least 75% of the purchase price.\nDespite these terms, Reiss has been distributing her audiobooks through Amazon for the past four years, both exclusively and non-exclusively, depending on the title.\nAccording to the complaint cited by Reuters, Amazon's use of exclusivity agreements has been a strategy to \"lock up content,\" hindering the ability of competitors to challenge the e-commerce giant and impacting billions of dollars in audiobook sales.\nSteve Berman, the plaintiff's attorney, stated: \u201cAuthors deserved a fair price for their work and not to be the victims of Amazon\u2019s abusive monopoly practices.\u201d\nAmazon's acquisition of Audible in 2008 for approximately $300m has positioned Audible as the largest audiobook retailer globally, commanding more than 60% of domestic purchases, while Apple holds about 20%.\nThe legal action seeks damages exceeding $5m and class action status for thousands of authors and rights holders who have paid Amazon a distribution fee of at least 60% on sales.\nThe complaint emphasises that this fee escalates to 75% for \"non-exclusive\" audiobooks available on Amazon and other platforms.\nHagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, the law firm representing the plaintiff, is also leading a consumer antitrust lawsuit accusing Amazon of artificially inflating the price of e-books.\n\"Amazon faces lawsuit for allegedly monopolising audiobook market \" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Ethan Howland ",
        "Text": "This story was originally published on Utility Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Utility Dive newsletter.\nA potentially precedent-setting proposal that would facilitate the co-location of an Amazon data center at Talen Energy\u2019s Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania could lead to cost shifting that harms utility customers, American Electric Power and Exelon said Monday while asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to hold a hearing on the issue.\nIf FERC declines to hold a hearing, the agency should reject the non-conforming interconnection service agreement, or ISA,\u00a0between the PJM Interconnection, Susquehanna Nuclear and PPL Electric Utilities, in part because it would allow the data center to take advantage of PJM\u2019s transmission system without paying for it, according to the protest filed Monday at FERC. The ISA could shift up to $140 million in transmission costs onto other PJM customers, AEP and Exelon said.\n\u201cShould large quantities of load rush to co-locate with generation on terms that bear even a resemblance to the ISA at issue here, PJM capacity markets will have steadily decreasing volume as the capacity resources flee to serve load that uses and benefits from \u2014 but does not pay for \u2014 the transmission system and the ancillary services that keep the system running,\u201d AEP and Exelon said. \u201cThis will harm existing customers.\u201d\nThe questions over the ISA come as nuclear power plant owners such as Constellation and Public Service Enterprise Group are exploring selling electricity directly to co-located data centers from their power plants. The pending ISA could set a precedent for those arrangements, according to AEP and Exelon.\nTalen Energy in March said it had agreed to sell a planned data center campus in Pennsylvania to Amazon.com\u2019s cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, for $650 million. Talen intends to sell power to AWS from its 2,228 MW stake in the nearby Susquehanna nuclear power plant.\nAWS has agreed to buy power from Talen in 120-MW increments for the data center, which could grow to 960 MW, according to Talen. It also has a one-time option to cap its commitment at 480 MW.\nIt would be the largest co-located load in North America, John Reed, chairman of Concentric Energy Advisors, said in testimony filed by AEP and Exelon.\nOn June 3, PJM asked FERC to approve an amended ISA that would allow Talen to sell 480 MW to the data center without making any transmission upgrades, up from 300 MW under the original ISA.\nAEP and Exelon contend the ISA raises major issues, including some that FERC hasn\u2019t ever reviewed.\n\u201cThe implications of this case are substantial because they have the potential to fundamentally impact the regulatory landscape, influencing how regulators address cost allocation and rate design,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThe precedent set by the modified ISA could \u2026 encourage a proliferation of co-located load arrangements, amplifying the magnitude of the associated costs and cross-subsidies.\u201d\nUnder the pending ISA, the co-located data center wouldn\u2019t be deemed \u201cnetwork load,\u201d which must pay PJM transmission fees, according to AEP and Exelon. However, PJM\u2019s tariff only defines two types of load: network load and load that pays for its own point-to-point transmission, they said.\nThe data center will benefit from PJM\u2019s transmission system and should be required to pay for its share of those benefits, according to AEP and Exelon. It should also pay for its share of ancillary services and capacity, they said.\n\u201cThe co-located load should not be allowed to operate as a free rider, making use of, and receiving the benefits of, a transmission system paid for by transmission ratepayers,\u201d AEP and Exelon said.\nFurther, the ISA seeks to evade the results of a recent PJM stakeholder process on co-located load, according to the utility companies. During the stakeholder process, a proposal that was similar to the pending ISA garnered 16% support in a 2023 vote, according to AEP and Exelon.\nThe questions posed by AEP and Exelon are the types of questions regulators would want answered when considering the co-located data center arrangements, according to Tony Clark, a senior advisor at Wilkinson Barker Knauer and a former FERC commissioner.\n\u201cThere may be some indication that the co-locating load is still getting some benefit from the greater grid,\u201d Clark said Tuesday. \u201cSo then it becomes a question of how does regulation account for that and make sure that there aren't free rider issues.\u201d\nWhile the ISA falls under FERC jurisdiction, the AWS co-location deal also raises state issues because it involves the retail sale of electricity, which is regulated by states, he said.\n\u201cPolicymakers and regulators in [regional transmission organization] regions must examine closely whether incentives inherent to organized markets are inviting a model of colocation that (i) results in unfair rate impacts to consumers, (ii) challenges reliable system operations, and (iii) promotes a \u2018shell game\u2019 for marketing rights around zero-emission electricity,\u201d Clark and Vincent Duane, a principal at Copper Monarch, said in a mid-April white paper on co-locating data centers at nuclear power plants.\n"

        "Title": "Teamsters tie up with Staten Island Amazon union, win other elections",
        "Author": "  John Kingston ",
        "Text": "The Teamsters union has recorded several organizing or contract-signing victories in the past few weeks, but a step it has taken toward representing at least one group of Amazon workers has garnered the biggest headlines.\nAn independent labor union that won representation at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse in 2022, a victory that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is fighting, has agreed to come under the umbrella of the Teamsters, according to media reports. The Teamsters posted an announcement about the agreement on the company\u2019s X (formerly Twitter) feed.\nThe Amazon Labor Union (ALU) is the grassroots organization that won a 2022 vote to unionize more than 8,000 workers at a giant Amazon facility in Staten Island. Efforts by national labor unions at other Amazon facilities have failed; the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union is seeking a third election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama.\n\nThe tie-up between the Teamsters and the ALU, announced Tuesday, needs to be ratified by the more than 8,000 rank-and-file members before becoming official.\nThe ALU has not been able to sign a contract with Amazon, which is fighting a legal battle against the union on several fronts.\nThere also have been multiple reports of strife within the union, which failed in an organizing vote at another Amazon warehouse on Staten Island soon after its victory. The ALU win in its first Staten Island vote remains the only time a union has won a representation election at an Amazon facility.\nHarry Katz, a professor at Cornell University and the president of the International Labor and Employment Relations Association, told FreightWaves that the ALU had preliminary discussions with the Teamsters about some sort of affiliation soon after it was elected but that the talks fell short.\n\nThe advice and guidance the ALU is getting as an independent union \u201cdoesn\u2019t compare to the know-how and resources that the Teamsters has,\u201d Katz said.\nGiven the extensive use of outside transportation companies Amazon uses, some of them with companies whose drivers have Teamsters representation, \u201cwhat the Teamsters potentially provides is leverage against Amazon,\u201d Katz said.\nWhile mounting some sort of secondary boycott is illegal, Katz said, the Teamsters may be able to find a way to \u201chassle\u201d the online retailer.\nBut it still will be a challenging battle. Although the ALU was voted in by the rank and file, that only mandates that Amazon bargain in \u201cgood faith.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to ever reach a first contract because the law merely requires Amazon to bargain in good faith,\u201d Katz said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t require that the parties reach agreement.\u201d\nBut with the Teamsters-ALU tie-up, Katz said it will need to be determined \u201cwhether the union at Amazon, affiliated with the Teamsters, can generate enough bargaining leverage to convince Amazon to sign its first agreement.\u201d\nKate Bronfenbrenner, director of Labor Education Research and a senior lecturer at Cornell University\u2019s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, described Amazon as \u201caggressive as an employer opposed to unions as you can get.\u201d She added that fact \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the union can\u2019t win, but it takes something much more than a one-local site can do.\u201d\nRatification by the members of the ALU, she said, is \u201cnot a slam dunk.\u201d\nWhile the affiliation with the ALU may be the Teamsters story that has gotten the most attention, the more mundane work of organizing workers and signing contracts was positive in May for the union.\n\nA list of contract representation votes from the National Labor Relations Board records three successful Teamsters organization elections certified by the NLRB in recent weeks.\nOne of them is at 10 Roads Express, where the Teamsters last year successfully organized workers in Iowa and Nebraska. The company is primarily a contract carrier for the U.S. Postal Service.\nIn the latest election at the Greensboro, North Carolina, facility of 10 Roads, according to NLRB data, 42 votes were cast in favor of representation while 13 were cast in opposition. The election covers all full-time and regular part-time route drivers employed at the site, according to the NLRB.\nIn a statement celebrating the victory, the Teamsters said the vote was the latest step in a broader effort to unionize drivers at the company.\nThe Teamsters said the North Carolina victory brings its record to having unionized more than 300 workers at 10 Roads facilities in Colorado and New Jersey, as well as the North Carolina and Midwest successes.\n\u201cThe Teamsters\u2019 victory in Greensboro will give us an even stronger foundation for more organizing at 10 Roads,\u201d John A. Murphy, Teamsters national freight director, said in the prepared statement. \u201cOur message to 10 Roads drivers everywhere is that the Teamsters are here to help you win what\u2019s yours. This latest win further solidifies the Teamsters\u2019 presence at 10 Roads and expands the growing movement among drivers to demand their rights and secure a better workplace.\u201d\nOther victories recently certified by the NLRB were for smaller groups of workers.\nAt Performance Team Logistics, a subsidiary of Maersk (DKK: MAERSK-B.CO), a vote in May saw 14 votes in favor of unionization with Teamsters Local 179. Three votes were cast in opposition.\nNLRB described the pool of voters as all full-time and part-time drivers at Performance\u2019s Elwood, Illinois facility.\nA spokeswoman for Maersk said Performance Team \u201cowns and operates trucks and electric vehicles in various locations across the United States.\u201d She added that there is unionization at other Performance Team facilities.\nThere are 19 workers impacted by the vote, she said. \u201cWhile we prefer to work directly with our employees without the presence of a third party, we respect each employee\u2019s right to make their own decision about whether to vote for a union,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\nThe NLRB also recently certified a victory for Teamsters Local 481 at Penske Truck Leasing in El Centro, California. The good news for the Teamsters was that the vote was unanimous. But the grand total of votes was three. It covers maintenance technicians.\nThe Teamsters does not always announce local victories. But it does frequently highlight contract signings and has done so recently.\nThe union\u2019s workers at several Ryder Truck Rental (NYSE: R) facilities in Minnesota, represented by Local 974, have ratified a three-year contract that calls for a 14.5% increase in pay over the life of the deal. There are also benefit improvements for the 43 workers covered by the contract. They include more vacation time and strike protections.\nUnionization is widespread at Ryder. In the company\u2019s 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for this year, Ryder said the company has 98 separate labor agreements. Its workers are primarily represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the United Auto Workers and the Teamsters.\nA Ryder spokeswoman confirmed the new deal and the size of the wage increase.\nRepresentatives from 10 Roads and the Teamsters had not responded to FreightWaves\u2019 queries by publication time.\nMore articles by John Kingston\nTeamsters rack up late-2023 wins, stage significant strike in \u201924\nTeamsters out at Southern California trucking company; other votes mixed\nWhy Teamsters is willing to sacrifice 22,000 union trucking jobs\nThe post Teamsters tie up with Staten Island Amazon union, win other elections appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

BJ\u2019s Warehouse is one such brand that offers same-day delivery, but whether this deal stacks up to Amazon Prime\u2019s benefits depends on your location and how frequently you shop.\nWhat it costs: $14.99 flat fee regardless of order size\nItems included: Grocery and household essentials, like toilet paper and laundry supplies\nAt $14.99 per order, frequent use of the same-day delivery option could add up. However, BJ\u2019s does offer membership add-ons for frequent shoppers, which might make this deal more enticing:\nSame-Day Select Multipack\nAllows customers to place up to 12 same-day delivery orders per year, though unused deliveries don\u2019t carry over to the following year\nPrice: $45\nSame-Day Select Unlimited\nAllows customers unlimited same-day deliveries each year, but not more than two per day\nPrice: $80\nAn active BJ\u2019s membership is required for all of the options listed above.

Free delivery still requires an active Prime membership, however. Members can pay $14.99 per month or $139 per year. In addition, Amazon offers reduced membership fees for students and those receiving certain kinds of government financial assistance, such as SNAP benefits.\nEligible items depend on your delivery location.\nItems display an \u201corder within\u201d countdown clock if same-day delivery is an option for your delivery address. Orders must be placed before the timer expires to be eligible for same-day delivery.\nAmazon offers same-day shipping at no extra charge for Prime members, but its membership prices are higher than BJ\u2019s. Paying the $9.99 non-member delivery fee on Amazon looks to be the cheapest bet for customers looking to make just a few orders per year. If you order more often but are primarily buying groceries and household essentials, BJ\u2019s basic membership and Same-Day Select Unlimited add-on may work out to be the better deal \u2014 though Unlimited customers are limited to two deliveries per day.

        "Title": "Is Amazon Dan Loeb\u2019s Top Growth Stock Pick?",
        "Author": "  Omer Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb and in this article we will discuss the activist investor's position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\nBillionaire investor Dan Loeb's hedge fund Third Point had a strong start to 2024 after its offshore fund posted returns of 7.8% in the first quarter chugging along with the broader market's 10.6% gain. AI has been one of his top investing themes for some time now and the activist shareholder maintains his bullish view on the technology. In the first quarter, he initiated a position in Alphabet and also increased his position in Amazon by 22% to about $920 million.\nLoeb's also bullish on the energy transition and one of his favorite stocks that is expected to benefit from the AI-driven electricity demand is Vistra, one of the largest independent power producers and retail electricity providers in the US. Though the power company's core markets have experienced volatility due to weak domestic electricity demand, its \"capital allocation strategy has been brilliant\", he stated in his Q1 2024 letter to shareholders, seen by Insider Monkey. In the weak demand environment for fossil fuels, The Texas-based energy group made smart moves by shutting down its unprofitable coal plants and instead buying back 33% of its shares between 2018 and 2023. Additionally, its acquisition of nuclear generation assets of Ohio-based energy company, Energy Harbor, was right on time as governments are turning to nuclear fuel sources to meet the world's growing energy demands. Loeb expects Vistra to be a direct beneficiary of AI-driven electricity demand and is bullish on the company's unique position of holding both renewable and fossil fuel-based assets under its belt.\nAnother AI play Loeb is increasingly bullish on is UK-based stock exchange and financial data company London Stock Exchange Group. The activist investor likes the company's unique market position as a data provider that is democratizing and making financial data accessible to consumers without the use of additional third-party software. He sees London Stock Exchange Group benefitting from generative AI as information retrieval systems in financial services become more powerful. He also expects the company to develop \"a powerful Research Assistant application\" with Microsoft to reduce both human resources and time needed to process financial data. He thinks London Stock Exchange Group is at the forefront of capitalizing on the transition of the financial services industry \"from manual data processing via clunky desktop terminals to machine-assisted data processing\".\nOur Methodology\nWe scanned Third Point\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked growth stocks from the fund\u2019s top 13F holdings. Additionally, we've also added overall hedge fund sentiment, as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNote: All pricing data is as of June 6.\nThird Point's Stake Value: $919,938,000\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\nDan Loeb grew his position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) by 22% and ended Q1 2024 with a stake of $919 million in the company. Loeb's bullish on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and sees it as another \"best run legacy\" company that stands to capitalize on AI's secular trends. Other hedge funds also grew their positions sizably in the company as the stock was part of 302 investors' portfolios in Q1 2024, up from 293 portfolios in Q4 2023.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was primarily known for its e-commerce business but over the years it has diversified into other verticals including cloud, streaming, advertising, and supply chain and logistics, among many others. The tech titan, like Loeb's other top 5 picks, has clear economic moats when it comes to its space. Amazon's been among the frontrunners to pen contracts with renewable power operators for 24-hour data centers. The company's also making strategic investments in AI startups, further growing its exposure and footprint. It invested an additional $2.75 billion in AI startup Anthropic in March, swelling its total investment to $4 billion. Its AWS business currently holds a majority market share and is among the top 3 cloud providers rivaling Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. The company's also developing its own custom AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) for facilitating the development of deep learning models.\nApart from being a true disruptor in tech, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has generated billions of dollars of free cash flow over the years. Over the past 10 years, its free cash flow has grown at a CAGR of 34%. In 2023, the e-commerce giant converted over 100% of its profits to free cash flow. Amazon ended the year with $30.42 billion in net income and $32.2 billion in free cash flow. Moreover, the company has grown its top-line by 22.4% over the past 10 years and even more impressively its profits (10-year CAGR for net income is 62.15%). For 2024, analysts anticipate the group to grow its EPS by 57% and revenue by 11%.\nOn the Street, price targets range from $180 to $353 (median is $220). AMZN has gained 45% over the past 12 months and its 1-year median target implies an additional 20% upside from current levels.\nAmazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) diversified business model, advances in AI and the data center market are painting an attractive story. While the stock is an obvious long-term portfolio pick, given its blue chip status and growth rates, its newest moves are adding more reasons to buy the stock while it trades at 3 times its sales while rivals MSFT and GOOG trade at higher P/S multiples of 13.3x and 7x.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is billionaire Dan Loeb's top growth stock pick.

        "Title": "How Nvidia Could Help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft Stocks Soar Even More",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's been a great time to own shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). All three stocks delivered strong gains last year and are up by double-digit percentages so far in 2024.\nBut it's been a spectacular time to own shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chip stock skyrocketed nearly 240% in 2023 and has vaulted more than 140% higher year to date.\nYou've probably heard the adage that \"success begets success.\" I think we'll see this proved in a convincing manner, with one company's success translating to success for others. Here's how Nvidia could help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft stocks soar even more.\nTo understand how Nvidia could help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, we first need to know something important about the three companies. Their cloud units are key growth drivers.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue jumped 28.4% year over year. This business generated nearly 20% of the company's total revenue growth despite making up less than 12% of total revenue.\nIt was a similar story for Amazon. Revenue for the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit increased 17% year over year in the first quarter, almost 39% of total revenue growth. AWS was an even bigger driver of Amazon's earnings growth.\nWhat about Microsoft? Its cloud business delivered revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter (which ended March 31) of 23% -- roughly 73% of total revenue growth.\nAnything that drives more customers to the cloud will directly help sales and earnings growth for Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. And over the long term, that should translate to increasing stock prices for each company.\nThis is where Nvidia comes into the picture. Its technology is helping all three giant cloud service providers to attract more customers and more business from existing customers.\nNvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress explained how the company is helping cloud service providers grow in its first-quarter earnings call. She said that organizations that use Nvidia's GPUs are able to train their large language models (LLMs) more quickly and more cost-effectively than with other chips. They can also deploy those models at the lowest cost with Nvidia's GPUs, Kress said.\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft enjoy exceptional returns on investment when they use Nvidia's AI technology. Kress said that cloud providers can earn $5 in hosting revenue with Nvidia's GPUs over four years for every $1 invested in the company's AI infrastructure.\nThese big cloud service providers also have ample motivation to adopt new technology introduced by Nvidia. In his company's first-quarter call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the importance of organizations being able to train AI models quickly.\nFor example, the company's forthcoming Blackwell GPU architecture enables training that is four times faster than with its wildly popular H100 GPUs. The new platform supports 30 times faster AI inference. It's not surprising that Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are among the early buyers of Blackwell -- even before it ships later this year.\nHaven't Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft developed their own AI chips? Could Nvidia's top customers become its rivals over time? Yes and yes.\nHuang was asked about this by an analyst in the first-quarter call. He responded by pointing out how Nvidia's technology differs from the custom chips the big cloud service providers offer. He believes that the scope, versatility, and low total cost of ownership of Nvidia's accelerated computing architecture; its pervasiveness across all types of computers, and the company's AI factories stand out as key competitive advantages.\nFor now, Nvidia and its big cloud customers enjoy a symbiotic relationship. Nvidia's sales grow as it launches new and improved AI technology. Alphabet's, Amazon's, and Microsoft's sales grow as they use Nvidia's latest products to attract customers. It's a win-win proposition for all four companies -- and their investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $740,688!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "More than 15,000 Amazon Flex Drivers File Claims of Misclassification, Unpaid Wages",
        "Author": "  Glenn Taylor ",
        "Text": "Thousands of Amazon Flex delivery drivers filed arbitration claims on Tuesday, alleging that their classification as independent contractors has resulted in unpaid wages, and the loss of overtime pay and expense reimbursements.\nApproximately 15,860 Amazon Flex drivers across California, Illinois and Massachusetts submitted the claims with the American Arbitration Association, on top of an additional 453 similar cases that are already being litigated.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nHow Amazon Is Educating Consumers About the Cotton Levi's Uses\nEast Coast Port Union Wants Wage Hikes 'Commensurate' With USMX Revenues\nFedEx Cutting Up to 2,000 Employees in Europe\nThe claims, collected over a span of four years by attorneys Joseph Sellers and Steven Tindall, contend that the drivers should be classified as Amazon employees instead of independent contractors.\nAmazon Flex is the tech titan\u2019s \u201cgig economy\u201d package delivery service, in which drivers can use a mobile app to sign up for shifts to deliver orders via the Prime Now and Amazon Fresh programs in their own vehicles.\nMost Amazon Flex drivers earn between $18 and $25 per hour, although actual earnings are dependent on factors including location, tips received and length of time to complete deliveries.\nOne such argument for employee classification came from a driver that indicated that Amazon does not provide Flex drivers with 10-minute rest breaks when their shift lasts longer than 3.5 hours. Another claim said Amazon does not provide 30-minute meal breaks for drivers who work more than five hours a day, whereas another claim alleged that Amazon fails to provide itemized wage statements required by California law.\nAdditionally, if a Flex driver books a three-hour block on the app, they only get paid for three hours, even if deliveries come in that take more time, one claim alleged.\n\u201cThe vast majority of Amazon Flex delivery partners finish their delivery blocks early,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson told Sourcing Journal. \u201cAmazon Flex delivery partners have the freedom to take breaks, stop to pick up their kids, run errands and work however they want.\u201d\nIn a statement, Amazon said Flex \u201cgives individuals the opportunity to set their own schedule and be their own boss, while earning competitive pay.\u201d\nAll of the claims were made by drivers in California, Illinois and Massachusetts, all of which have rules that limit the amount of control companies can exert over independent contractors.\nThe definition and rights of a contract worker versus an employee has been up for debate in laws such as California\u2019s Prop 22, which allows ride hailing and delivery drivers to be treated as independent contractors with some added benefits, including a minimum earnings guarantee.\nThe company has had battles with its Flex drivers in the past, and lost. Amazon had to fork over more than $61.7 million to settle Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charges after the agency found the company short changed Flex drivers in tips over a two-and-a-half year period.\nThe settlement prohibited Amazon from misrepresenting driver earnings, pay or percent of tips paid to drivers or changing its handling of tips without drivers\u2019 consent.\nWhile Amazon contends with this slew of arbitration claims, the e-commerce giant got a major labor win Wednesday, when a Manhattan appeals court threw out a 2022 order that had previously prevented the company from terminating union supporters.\nU.S. District Judge Diane Gujarati issued the order in November 2022, which required Amazon to cease retaliation, including terminating, against pro-union employees, in response to the 2020 firing of Gerald Bryson, an Amazon union organizer who was terminated after a protest of alleged unsafe Covid-19 protocols in Amazon\u2019s \u201cJFK8\u201d Staten Island warehouse.\nThe judge issued the order at the request of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which accused Amazon of illegally firing Bryson.\nAmazon has long held that it fired Bryson over his conduct at the protest and not because of his support for unionization, saying he violated the company\u2019s vulgar-language policy by entering a dispute with a coworker at the demonstration.\nTwo years later, the JFK8 warehouse became the first U.S. Amazon facility to successfully unionize.\nAt the time of Gujarati\u2019s ruling, the judge said Bryson\u2019s firing violated his rights under U.S. labor law, leading her to bar Amazon from firing other union supporters. But the judge refused to order Amazon to reinstate Bryson, saying there was no evidence that his firing deterred other workers from unionizing.\nBut in the Wednesday ruling, a three-judge panel ruled that the requirement that Amazon not fire other workers was unnecessary if there was no evidence that Bryson\u2019s firing had a broader impact.\n\u201cThe district court abused its discretion in issuing the cease-and-desist order without adequately explaining why that relief was just and proper,\u201d the panel ruled. \u201cSufficient explanation was particularly necessary because the district court concluded, based on the same record, that other, closely related relief was not just and proper. We therefore vacate in part the district court\u2019s injunction.\u201d\nSourcing Journal reached out to Amazon.\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list titled Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer in a latest program talked about the effect of inflation on US consumers and discussed how it\u2019s impacting the Haves and the Have Nots. Cramer said while everyone is feeling the \u201cpinch of inflation,\u201d the Have Nots are feeling a \u201check of a lot more\u201d than the Haves.\u00a0 Cramer said that the difference between these two classes of consumers is very important for investment portfolios. He complained that many retailers don\u2019t even know their consumers and that\u2019s why they have a totally different reading of the current economic situation and its effects on consumers. Cramer criticized those who aren\u2019t careful about the differences between consumers and use \u201cthe consumer\u201d as a blanket term.\nCramer talked about several retail companies and how they are directly feeling the effects of inflation as consumers cut back on spending. The CNBC host said that Americans are making tough choices because of rising prices but we usually don\u2019t talk about it.\nJim Cramer said that many strategists demand several rate cuts because \u201cthey want stocks higher.\u201d\n\u201cI want higher stock prices too but if we get multiple rate cuts and inflation comes roaring back, it\u2019s the Have Nots that will get hurt.\u201d\nJim Cramer said that while many people won\u2019t be happy to see a strong jobs report (because that decreases the chances of rate cuts), they should keep in mind the tough situation the Federal Reserve is in.\n\u201cJay Powell isn\u2019t worried about those of us with big portfolios. He\u2019s worried about the tens of millions of people with almost nothing in the bank.\u201d\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired recently and picked 10 stocks he\u2019s bullish about and recommending investors to buy or hold. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\nIn a recent program, Jim Cramer said that he thinks Amazon.com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0has a \u201clot of room to go higher.\u201d Cramer is bullish on Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0advertising business. He also praised the company\u2019s AWS business and said Amazon.com Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is \u201cback with a great growth number.\u201d\nAWS is indeed growing rapidly. AWS operating margins crossed 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon\u2019s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack \u2013 infrastructure with NVIDIA\u2019s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list of Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.

        "Text": "Amazon is reviewing claims that the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI is scraping content \u2014 including from prominent news sites \u2014 without approval.\nAmazon spokesperson Samantha Mayowa confirmed Friday that the tech giant was assessing information it received from the news outlet WIRED, which published an investigation earlier this month that said Perplexity appeared to scrape content from websites that had prohibited access from such practices. Perplexity uses servers by Amazon Web Services, otherwise known as AWS.\nAmazon\u2019s \u201cterms of service prohibit abusive and illegal activities and our customers are responsible for complying with those terms,\u201d Mayowa said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe routinely receive reports of alleged abuse from a variety of sources and engage our customers to understand those reports.\u201d\nPerplexity spokesperson Sara Platnick said Friday that the company had determined that Perplexity-controlled services are not crawling websites in any way that violates AWS terms of service.\nThe San Francisco-based AI search startup has been a darling of prominent tech investors, including heavy hitters such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Forbes later said it found similar \u201cknock-off\u201d stories lifted from other publications.\nSeparately, The Associated Press found another Perplexity product invented fake quotes from real people.\nSrinivas said in an AP interview earlier this month that his company \u201cnever ripped off content from anybody. Our engine is not training on anyone else\u2019s content,\u201d in part because the company is simply aggregating what other companies\u2019 AI systems generate.\nBut, he added, \u201cIt was accurately pointed out by Forbes that they preferred a more prominent highlighting of the source.\u201d He said sources are now highlighted more prominently.\n___\nAP reporters Matt O'Brien and Sarah Parvini contributed to this report.\n"

It will come after a four-day sales event hosted by Walmart, which said Monday it plans to offer its \u201clargest deals\u201d ever between July 8 and July 11.\nAmazon's discounts are open to Prime members who pay $14.99 per month, or $139 per year, for access to deals and other perks, such as free shipping.\nThe company doesn't disclose how much revenue it pulls in from such events. But it has been hosting more of them in recent years to attract consumers dealing with rising credit costs and high \u2014 but easing \u2014 inflation.\nAmazon held an October event for Prime members in the last two years to kick off the holiday shopping season. In March, the company \u2014 which has faced more competition from low-cost retailers Shein and Temu \u2014 held its first-ever spring sales event for all shoppers.\nAmazon said Prime members in two dozen countries will participate in July's discount event, which will also mark the start of the back-to-school shopping season for the company. Historically, Prime discounts have attracted shoppers to items offered on Amazon\u2019s site.\nThe company says Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s Prime song, a bonus track from her forthcoming album \u201cMEGAN,\u201d will be available for fans listening only on Amazon Music. It also said it would offer early deals on items from the rapper's new tour merchandise collection.\n"

        "Text": "E-commerce giant Amazon is facing a class action lawsuit in the UK for the alleged misuse of retailer data and manipulation of its Buy Box feature to benefit its commercial operation.\nThe \u00a31bn damages claim, the largest collective action ever launched by UK retailers, has been initiated by the British Independent Retailers Association (BIRA) at the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) in London.\nThe lawsuit accuses Amazon of illegally using data from UK retailers and manipulating its Buy Box to prioritise its own products since October 2015. This has reportedly boosted its revenues and profits at the expense of the retailers.\nThe e-commerce retailer can allegedly use this data to decide if it should introduce a new product segment depending on its earnings and sales potential, how to set the price and the target consumers.\nThe lawsuit claims that the retailers, many of whom are small businesses, were unaware that Amazon was exploiting their data to its benefit, despite paying a non-negotiable 30% commission on every product sold on the platform.\nBIRA is represented by international legal solutions provider Willkie Farr & Gallagher (UK).\nIts legal team, led by Willkie Farr partners Boris Bronfentrinker, Elaine Whiteford and Michelle Clark, will submit more than 1,150 pages of documentation outlining their case against Amazon.\nThe team is supported by barristers Sarah Ford KC and Jason Pobjoy.\nIn 2022, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an investigation into Amazon for allegedly abusing its dominant position and unfairly benefiting its own retail business. Amazon's access to sensitive third-party retailer data was a key concern for the CMA, as it could influence product and pricing decisions.\nBIRA CEO Andrew Goodacre said: \u201cThe British public has a strong relationship with its local, independent retailers and ensuring they are not put out of business by Amazon\u2019s illegal actions is a key driving force behind this collective action.\n\u201cThe filing of the claim today is the first step towards retailers obtaining compensation for what Amazon has done. I am confident that the CAT will authorise the claim to go forward, and I look forward to the opportunity to present the case on behalf of UK retailers. This is a watershed moment for UK retailers, but especially for small independent retailers in this country.\u201d\nIn May 2023 a Reuters report revealed that a US Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against Amazon regarding its Prime membership programme will continue after a Seattle judge rejected Amazon\u2019s attempt to dismiss the case.\n\"Amazon faces \u00a31bn class action lawsuit over data misuse \" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Text": "New innovative tools and features provide business customers with a convenient, intuitive, and personalized buying experience\nThrough Amazon Business, multinational enterprises including Fortune 100, FTSE 100, and DAX-40 can maximize value for their company to help navigate challenges and stay on track for long-term growth\nThese technologies were highlighted at Amazon Business Exchange\u2014a single-day event for European industry leaders to discover new innovations and successful strategies to grow their business\nSEATTLE, June 20, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Business (NASDAQ: AMZN), the company\u2019s online business-to-business procurement store, today announced a number of new technology features including the Amazon Business App Center, System for Cross-domain Identity Management, and Integrated Quoting. Amazon Business also made a number of updates to its Budget Management and Guided Buying solutions. These technologies are designed to help large business customers, including multinational enterprises, universities, government agencies, education organizations, and healthcare networks, simplify and modernize the way they shop for business supplies.\n\"Amazon Business wants to change how companies shop for supplies through our unmatched selection, deep discounts, and smart capabilities,\" said Shelley Salomon, worldwide vice president of Amazon Business. \"We don't just react to the biggest challenges our customers have shared with us; we get ahead of them with new technologies so our customers can use their resources to navigate the unexpected and continue expanding their business.\"\nRecent research conducted by Amazon Business revealed that U.S. procurement teams are struggling to drive efficiencies within their organization, with close to 49% of respondents reporting complexity of systems and multi-step processes as the main contributors to this problem. As a result, 95% of procurement leaders acknowledge that there\u2019s a need to optimize their procurement functions. Specifically, respondents feel that business buying is cumbersome, convoluted, and time-consuming. Instead of a convenient, intuitive, and personalized experience, teams are spending too much time performing tasks related to processing orders and leaders see improved procurement tools as the solution for this challenge.\nTo help address this challenge, Amazon Business has introduced and upgraded several tools available to business buyers in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, including:\nAmazon Business App Center is a new one-stop shop where business customers can discover, quickly set-up, and connect their Amazon Business account with more than 25 third-party applications from around the world. Solutions in the App Center include integrated shopping, accounting management, expense management, inventory management, rewards and recognition, and business analytics. The App Center helps save leaders time and money through a single point of discovery as well as eliminating or reducing the need to develop a custom solution for their organization.\nSystem for Cross-domain Identity Management is a new feature that automatically syncs users and group data from their organization\u2019s identity provider with their Amazon Business account. This feature helps administrators spend less time on maintaining and updating their Amazon Business account.\nBudget Management streamlines the process of setting and reviewing time-bound budgets across an organization. Now, business customers can set spend thresholds and make budget amounts visible to buyers to get ahead of overspending. Amazon Business also launched new ways for leaders to actively manage their budgets including real-time tracking and usage reports, notifications when a budget is about to expire, pre-purchase approvals, and an option to create one purchase order (PO) instead of multiple, manual orders. These updates empower procurement buyers to make informed purchasing decisions for their organization while reducing the amount of time leaders spend auditing their purchases.\nGuided Buying makes it easier for leaders to manage employee spending by steering buyers to purchase decisions that align with their organization\u2019s preferences and goals. Through a new toolbar, account administrators can now instantly prefer products with sustainability certifications in the Climate Pledge Friendly program with a single click. Leaders can also restrict, block, and require an approval for certain product categories with an eligible Business Prime plan. Through easy-to-follow visuals, Guided Buying helps procurement leaders save time educating their employees on what items they should or should not purchase.\nIntegrated Quoting is a new feature that helps business customers generate custom quotes for Amazon Business bulk orders as well as other suppliers via third-party e-sourcing and e-procurement platforms. Integrated Quoting is ideal for business customers purchasing more than 1,000 items or more than $10,000 in total value. After requesting a bid, the feature centralizes an organization\u2019s Request for Quote (RFQ) activity making it even easier for leaders to identify cost savings and select the most competitive bid.\nAmazon Business makes business buying simpler by offering the same easy-to-use experience customers know and love from Amazon. Since launching in the U.S. in 2015, Amazon Business has empowered businesses of all sizes through unmatched selection, deep discounts, and smart capabilities. Today, Amazon drives roughly $35B in annualized gross sales and has more than 6 million customers worldwide including 96 of the Fortune 100, 66 of the FTSE 100, and 37 of the DAX-40 companies. Working closely with customers to understand their business buying challenges, Amazon Business continues to develop new technologies that make it easy for organizations and administrators to define, meet, and proactively measure progress toward their purchasing budgets and goals. Amazon Business is now a strategic partner to businesses in 10 countries including Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\"As a purchasing manager for a large public school district, I know all too well that teachers don\u2019t have extra time during the day to buy the supplies they need. Amazon Business makes the buying process easy as teachers are already familiar with the Amazon shopping experience,\" said Greg Long, purchasing manager at Seminole County Public Schools. \"One of our favorite Amazon Business features is Budget Management. It gives teachers visibility into our budget so they know how much they have to spend, making it easier to stay within our annual budget.\"\nVisit the Amazon Business website to learn more.\nAbout Amazon Business\nAmazon Business helps millions of customers worldwide \u2014 from small businesses, schools, hospitals, nonprofits, and government agencies to large enterprises with global operations \u2014 reshape their procurement with cost and time savings, greater productivity, and insightful purchasing analytics. Procurement and business leaders enjoy convenient shipping options on hundreds of millions of supplies across categories like office, IT, janitorial, food service, and medical supplies.

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has become an e-commerce and cloud computing powerhouse over the past several years -- and this has translated into a track record of revenue and profit growth. Even in tough times, like in the recent high-interest-rate environment, Amazon prevailed, revamping its cost structure and going on to recover and grow.\nOf course, the stock price has dipped at certain points, but overall, if you had invested in Amazon a while back and stuck with this dynamic player, you would have scored a win. Let's take a look at how much you would have now if you'd invested $10,000 in Amazon a decade ago.\nIf you'd bought $10,000 worth of Amazon stock 10 years ago, today your investment would be worth more than $114,690. With that, Amazon proves it's made a great long-term holding. But now the question is whether that's still the case.\nCould this top technology and consumer stock have further to go? The answer is yes, for three reasons. Amazon continues to lead in the high-growth industries of e-commerce and cloud computing, so it should benefit from this in the coming years.\nOn top of this, Amazon has put its focus on investing in artificial intelligence (AI), a technology that's helping the company in two ways. Amazon uses AI to gain efficiency across its own businesses, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) sells AI products and services to customers. Since AWS is the world's biggest cloud provider, it's in the perfect position to connect with customers that are launching AI projects.\nImportantly, AI demand is also helping Amazon to monetize its AI investment, with AWS already reaching a $100 billion annual revenue run rate.\nAll this suggests that Amazon has what it takes to generate earnings growth in the years to come, and that could translate into share price gains -- confirming Amazon's status as a great long-term investment well into the future.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

Sports content continues to attract a reliable and loyal audience at a time when traditional TV businesses are losing millions of subscribers to cord-cutting.\nThe WSJ report said that NBC would pay an average of $2.5 billion a year to the NBA under the arrangement and show around 100 games per season, with about half airing exclusively on Comcast's Peacock streaming service.\nAmazon's package would amount to $1.8 billion a year and will include regular-season and playoff games and a share of the conference finals, which will be split in a rotation among the media partners, the report said.\nDisney's payments will average about $2.6 billion annually, more than the $1.5 billion it paid under the current deal, and will continue to air the NBA Finals though it will get fewer games under the new deal, the WSJ reported.\nThe deal, as reported by WSJ, would leave out Warner Bros Discovery, whose Turner Sports network has shown NBA games for about four decades. Analysts have said that Warner Bros Discovery's heavy debt load could hamper its ability to compete for NBA's rights.\nThe Journal report said that Warner Bros Discovery can still match a rival package, while the NBA can create a new package for the company in the final stretch, but the options for the media company are limited.\nESPN and Comcast declined to comment, while the other companies and the NBA did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.\nIf finalized, ESPN's deal will enable the company to air the games on its direct-to-consumer streaming service, set to launch in 2025, WSJ said, adding that the deal will also include rights to WNBA telecasts.\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)\n"

The improving used vehicle market is another tailwind.\nNew Downgrades\nB&G Foods' (BGS) Sales Hurt by Soft Foodservice BusinessPer the Zacks analyst, B&G Foods is battling challenges in its foodservice business due to soft out-of-home traffic. Additionally, slow recovery of sales to retail customers led to lowered sales view.\nQuidelOrtho (QDEL) Plagued by Dependence on Diagnostic TestsPer the Zacks analyst, stiff competition and over dependence on diagnostic tests will likely hinder QuidelOrtho's top-line growth. However, strong product portfolio raises optimism\nSofter Comps Growth Hurt Cracker Barrel's (CBRL) ProspectsPer the Zacks analyst, Cracker Barrel's prospects are hurt due to a decline in guest traffic, on the back of ongoing inflationary pressures and macroeconomic risks, thus resulting in softer comps.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "As we approach the midpoint of the year, the retail battleground is heating up with three major players, Target Corporation TGT, Walmart Inc. WMT and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, all rolling out substantial sales events this July. Each of these retail giants is employing unique strategies to capture consumer attention and drive sales during this crucial shopping period. Let\u2019s dive into the specifics of what each has to offer and analyze their potential impact on consumer spending and market share.\nTarget is poised to capture significant consumer interest with the return of its biggest sales event of the season, Target Circle Week.

        "Title": "Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other hedge fund-approved stocks.\nInvesting, broadly speaking, narrows down to two strategies. These see an investor decide whether to buy a stock for the short term and make quick profits or hold it for years to patiently wait for the returns to accrue. One of the most successful investor of our times, Warren Buffett (see his latest portfolio), is an ardent follower of the latter approach, and his wealth bears testament to his success.\nOf course, deciding to pick the right stocks to sit on for years isn't easy or else everyone would be rich by now. However, there are ways in which one can gain an edge over others. One such way is to see what the professionals are doing and then emulate their strategy. At Insider Monkey, we get right at the heart of investing by picking out the top stocks that hedge funds are investing in. Why hedge fund stock picks? Well, these professionals, who almost often charge an arm and a leg for their services, conduct extensive due diligence to pick out the right set of stocks. After all, no one would invest with a hedge fund if the fund was simply picking stocks by flipping a coin.\nYet, while due diligence is great and necessary to protect investors, investing, at the end of the day, is all about returns. By the looks of it, the funds do seem to know what they're doing. Last year, the top ten hedge fund stock picks ended up outperforming the S&P benchmark stock index by 48.9 percentage points. In other words, while the index returned 26.1% in 2023, the top ten stocks returned 75.1% through price gains. This trend is also present in the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2023 as these posted 53.2% in gains to outperform the S&P by 27 percentage points. Unsurprisingly, year to May 29th, the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2024 led the S&P's 11% and posted 20.2% in gains.\nUnfortunately, though, data shows that as of 2021 end, 14% of the stock market was made of active funds while 16% was accounted for by passive funds. Compared to passive funds accounting for 8% of the market a decade ago with 20% belonging to active funds, it's clear that the broader public believes that shifting to passive is a safer investment approach. After all, while everyone wants to make money, no one wants to lose it either.\nBut what if one could make their own investing decisions and gain an inside track to investing by figuring out what stocks most hedge funds have invested in? Well, at Insider Monkey we regularly compile data from more than 900 hedge funds to see where the smart money is headed. This is how we know that the top hedge fund stocks outperformed the benchmark index last year, and it's also a strategy that's helped us beat the market over the last 10 years. Compared to the SPY's 235.6% in returns between 2014 and May 2024, the 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 463.7%.\nBut wait. At this point, you could argue that since hedge fund SEC filings come with a 45 day lag, perhaps they aren't that important.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is an interesting stock. This is because while its fortunes are because of the highly lucrative and fast growing eCommerce market, the firm has used this growth to establish a commanding position in the enterprise computing market too. This means that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) can balance its eCommerce and enterprise computing businesses, and use AI to the benefit of both. The firm's dominant market share in eCommerce insulates it from new entrants or competitors to provide it with a stable moat. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s AWS platform designs its own chips and has integrated AI into customer offerings too, in order to adequately compete with offerings from Microsoft. Keeping an eye high growth industries, the firm's satellite internet subsidiary Kuiper which plans to launch satellites soon can also provide it an entry into an attractive cash flow generating market currently dominated by SpaceX's Starlink.\nIthaka Group mentioned Amazon.com, Inc.

Here is what the firm said:\nFounded in 1994, Amazon has evolved from its early roots as an online bookstore to become one of the world\u2019s largest eCommerce retailers. At the end of 2022 Amazon stood poised to capture ~40% of all US e-commerce sales, representing five times more share than the next closest competitor. In addition to eCommerce, Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) has become the market leader in outsourced cloud infrastructure. Further, Amazon Advertising is garnering significant share in digital advertising, particularly product placement ads, thanks to consumers beginning their product searches on Amazon\u2019s site. Amazon\u2019s stock appreciated on the back of stabilization of the company\u2019s cloud computing segment and increased confidence the company would be able to contain expenses and push operating margins above prior peaks in the near-to-medium term.\nOverall AMZN ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the best hedge fund-approved stocks to buy.

Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nThe Federal Reserve now expects just one rate cut in this year, and the market\u2019s reaction to this development has been calmer-than-expected, showing investors are now paying little to no attention to what the Fed does and instead have their eyes focused on AI, which continues to push the markets higher. Tech companies, small and large, are continuing to roll out AI-focused products and solutions, while funds are pouring billions into AI. \u00a0SoftBank has recently committed another $5 billion in AI investments for 5 companies ($1 billion each). A Wall Street Journal report cited SoftBank\u2019s CFO, who said the bank\u2019s chief Masayoshi Son was taking a \u201cbreak from quarterly earnings meetings so he could focus on AI.\u201d\nIn this backdrop it\u2019s important to stay ahead of the curve and see what\u2019s happening in the AI space.\nIn this article we will take a look at some of the biggest AI stock ratings updates and stories which can\u2019t be missed. We focused on AI stocks that are popular among the smart money investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nchristian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\nMorgan Stanley recently published a list of stocks that are poised to be \u201cwinners\u201d by providing convenience to consumers in the current environment where spending is slowing. Morgan Stanley\u2019s Michael J. Wilson believes allowing consumers to \u201csave time and make their life easier is a valuable product.\u201d Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0is part of Morgan Stanley\u2019s list.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was also on investors\u2019 radar as the company was holding Re:Inforce conference where it addressed key topics like generative AI, risks, compliance, data production, and much more.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon\u2019s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack \u2013 infrastructure with NVIDIA\u2019s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week.

        "Text": "Amazon.com Services has been fined \u00a35.9m by California's Labor Commissioner's Office for violating the state's warehouse quotas law at two distribution centres.\nThe distribution warehouses are located in Moreno Valley in Riverside County, and Redlands in San Bernardino County.\nThe law, effective from 1 January 2022, mandates that warehouse employers must inform employees in writing about any work quotas, including tasks per hour and potential disciplinary actions for non-compliance.\nThe initial inspection by the Labor Commissioner's Office began on 22 September 2022.\nThe investigation uncovered 59,017 violations at the Amazon warehouses from 20 October 2023 to 9 March 2024.\nPenalties were levied under Labor Code 2699(f), which stipulates a \u00a3100 fine for each infringement.\nThe Warehouse Worker Resource Center, a non-profit organisation aiming to enhance warehouse industry conditions in Southern California, supported the Labor Commissioner.\nAmazon was found to have failed to provide the required written notice of quotas. The company contended that a quota system was unnecessary due to its peer-to-peer evaluation system.\nHowever, the law defines a quota as a work pace that, if not maintained, results in disciplinary action.\nIt also restricts quotas that hinder compliance with meal or rest breaks, bathroom facility use or occupational health and safety laws.\nA quota is deemed illegal if it is not disclosed to workers or if it prevents employees from exercising their legal rights.\nLabor Commissioner Lilia Garc\u00eda-Brower said: \u201cThe peer-to-peer system that Amazon was using in these two warehouses is exactly the kind of system that the warehouse quotas law was put in place to prevent. Undisclosed quotas expose workers to increased pressure to work faster and can lead to higher injury rates and other violations by forcing workers to skip breaks.\u201d\nAmazon has also collaborated with Staples Canada to facilitate label-free, box-free returns for Amazon customers at all Staples retail locations.\nThe partnership allows Amazon items to be returned at Staples' 298 stores across the country - a convenient option that reduces the need for additional shipping boxes.\nThe national initiative marks Amazon's first such programme in Canada, emphasising the company's dedication to seamless customer return experiences.\nCustomers can return eligible items to Staples Canada in the original manufacturer's packaging.\nAmazon also recently faced a proposed class action lawsuit for allegedly monopolising the retail market for audiobooks.\n\"Amazon fined for California\u2019s warehouse quotas law breach \" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

It said its contract for providing crews, maintenance and insurance has been extended until 2030 and that it will begin operating the initial aircraft in the first quarter of 2025.\nAll eight aircraft are expected to be operational in Amazon\u2019s domestic parcel network by the third quarter of 2025, increasing Sun Country\u2019s freighter fleet to 20 aircraft.\u00a0In addition to providing the aircraft, Amazon pays for many flight expenses, including fuel and is responsible for loading and unloading.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is reallocating the eight 737-800 freighters after agreeing last month to terminate its transport partnership with Atlas Air, which also lost flying business from 16 Boeing 767-300 freighters Amazon is transferring to ABX Air.\nAmazon directly controls the eight 737-800s, which are leased from AerCap.\n\u201cAmazon is an extremely important customer to Sun Country and strong execution on our current cargo services positioned us well to grow our business. We look forward to continuing to provide services to Amazon into the 2030s,\u201d said Sun Country CEO Jude Bricker in the announcement.\nSun Country\u2019s cargo revenue in 2023 increased 10.4% year over year to $100 million even though the rest of the air cargo industry, including express air carriers, experienced downturns in aircraft utilization and revenue. The airline benefitted from Amazon gaining share in a declining domestic parcel market, where iit overtook FedEx and UPS last year in total deliveries.\u00a0First quarter cargo revenue at Sun Country increased 2.5%, to $24 million, from the same period a year ago.\nSun Country, which entered the cargo space to diversify revenue in a highly competitive passenger market, and Amazon have the right to extend the amended contract through 2037. Sun Country\u2019s stock price jumped 10% to $11.32 per share in early trading on Thursday.\nAmazon relies on partner carriers to operate its network because it isn\u2019t a pure airline with its own operating authority.

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "One case study involving a large multinational grocery company showed a $10 million Thursday Night Football campaign delivered $63 million in additional sales across non-Amazon retailers, such as Walmart, Target, Kroger, and other retailers.\nSEATTLE, June 17, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In partnership with Amazon, Stackline, the leading AI-enabled retail intelligence and activation platform, has launched a leading-edge Multi-Retailer Attribution solution. This new offering redefines how brands measure the sales impact of their advertising across multiple retailers \u2013 online and brick-and-mortar \u2013 addressing long-standing challenges in the industry.\nThe digital advertising landscape has grown increasingly complex, with brands demanding more precise data to allocate and optimize their marketing budgets. Historically, retailer attribution models have focused on a single retailer's performance. Brand leaders have not been privy to the impact of their media spend on other retailers or channels.\nThis consumer behavior results in incomplete ROI calculations, as purchases are influenced by Amazon ads, but the final transaction happens on other retailers' physical stores or websites. Historically, if a consumer engaged with an ad on Amazon but purchased from Walmart, Target, or Kroger, the brand was unable to measure the full impact of that campaign across retailers.\nStackline Multi-Retailer Attribution combines proprietary audience technology and Amazon Marketing Cloud to allow brands to finally quantify all consumer purchases driven by their Amazon advertising investments across all major retailers. This innovative approach captures a comprehensive view by measuring consumer purchases across retailers and channels at the individual products level \u2013 and then connecting that behavior back to shoppers who engaged with your Amazon paid search, DSP, or other media campaigns.\nUsing this technology, a prominent multinational grocery client surfaced remarkable success with their Thursday Night Football advertising campaign. The client aired commercials across four of their leading brands throughout the football season, investing nearly $10 million in dynamic and engaging ads.\nThe commercials generated ad-attributed sales that extended far beyond Amazon.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon AMZN is leaving no stone unturned to expand its grocery retail footprint in the United States on the back of brick-and-mortar concept.In this regard, the company recently inaugurated its second Amazon Fresh store in New Jersey.The new 35,500-square-foot store offers prepared foods, international condiments and grocery items from more than 75 local brands and Amazon private brands.Customers who visit this store can also use Amazon Dash smart carts, palm-scanning Amazon One technology and Alexa kiosks, making grocery shopping more convenient for shoppers.The latest move not only strengthens Amazon Fresh business but also boosts the company\u2019s physical retail footprint.\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\nIn addition to opening a new store in New Jersey, Amazon is set to open another Amazon Fresh store in Virginia.The company is also set to launch a smaller Whole Foods Market concept in Manhattan called Whole Foods Market Daily Shop. These quick-shop stores, ranging from 7,000 to 14,000 square feet, will offer grab-and-go meals, snacks, weekly essentials, seasonal produce, prepared foods, bread, alcohol, supplements and local specialties.Moreover, the company\u2019s smart shopping cart, called Amazon Dash Cart, powered by advanced computer vision technology, is a plus. It provides personalized shopping experiences with an on-cart screen featuring maps and navigation and helps customers skip checkout lines. Dash Cart also tracks customers' savings and spending in real-time, making it a preferred choice for customers.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company also launched a Prime grocery benefit, offering $9.99 monthly delivery for orders under $40 from Whole Foods or Amazon Fresh. This offering is expected to help customers satisfy their grocery needs and potentially change how people split their orders over time. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThe growing grocery retail efforts will help Amazon fend off competitors like Walmart WMT, Costco COST and Target TGT, which are making concerted efforts to expand their grocery business.Walmart is replacing price stickers with electronic shelf labels in grocery stores, allowing employees to update prices every ten seconds. The labels also feature product descriptions with barcodes that can provide additional information, such as product sourcing, gluten-free status, or keto-friendly options, using mobile devices.Meanwhile, Costco\u2019s growing strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth have been the key factors in driving its grocery business.Target, on the other hand, plans to bolster its grocery business further with the introduction of its generative AI technology, Store Companion. The chatbot tool, currently in pilot testing at 400 locations, will answer process and procedure-related questions of store employees.\nAmazon\u2019s shares have gained 20.3% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector\u2019s growth of 15.1%. The company is benefiting from its strengthening grocery business, solid Prime momentum, strong adoption rate of AWS, deepening focus on generative AI and its robust smart home security devices portfolio. It is also gaining from a strong global presence, solid momentum among small and medium businesses and growing capabilities in pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving.These factors are expected to continue driving the overall financial performance of the company in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $638.24 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.04%.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $4.58 per share, indicating a 57.9% rise from the year-ago figure.

        "Title": "Amazon says it'll spend $230 million on generative AI startups",
        "Author": "  Kyle Wiggers ",
        "Text": "Amazon says that it will commit up to $230 million to startups building generative AI-powered applications.\nThe investment, roughly $80 million of which will fund Amazon's second AWS Generative AI Accelerator program, aims to position AWS as an attractive cloud infrastructure choice for startups developing generative AI models to power their products, apps and services. Much of the new tranche -- including the entire portion set aside for the accelerator program -- comes in the form of compute credits for AWS infrastructure, meaning that it can't be transferred to other cloud service providers like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.\nTo sweeten the pot, Amazon is pledging that startups in this year's Generative AI Accelerator cohort will gain access to experts and tech from Nvidia, the program's presenting partner. They will also be invited to join the Nvidia Inception program, which provides companies opportunities to connect with potential investors and additional consulting resources.\nThe Generative AI Accelerator program has also grown substantially. Last year's cohort, which had 21 startups, received only up to $300,000 in AWS compute credits, amounting to around a combined $6.3 million investment.\n\"With this new effort, we will help startups launch and scale world-class businesses, providing the building blocks they need to unleash new AI applications that will impact all facets of how the world learns, connects, and does business,\" Matt Wood, VP of AI products at AWS, said in a statement.\nAmazon's growing spending on generative AI tech, which includes efforts like its $100 million AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, free credits for startups using major AI models and its Project Olympus model, comes as the company looks to catch up to tech giant rivals in the blooming -- and increasingly competitive -- generative AI space. While Amazon claims that its various generative AI businesses have reached \"multiple billions\" in run rate, the company is widely perceived as having missed the boat on generative AI.\nAWS originally planned to unveil its own generative AI model akin to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT code-named Bedrock -- which eventually became Amazon\u2019s Bedrock model hosting service -- at its annual conference in November 2022, according to The Information. But major bugs forced the organization to postpone the launch. (Amazon PR disputes this.)\nAmazon's Alexa division has been beset with challenges as well, thanks to technical setbacks and political infighting, as reported by Fortune's Sharon Goldman this week. Nine months after a splashy press demo of a \"next-gen\" Alexa, the new Alexa is reportedly far from ready for prime time -- the result of insufficient training data, inadequate access to training hardware and other roadblocks.\nAmazon also passed on early opportunities to back two leading AI startups, Cohere and Anthropic. The company later tried to invest in Cohere, but was rejected -- and had to settle for a co-investment (albeit a\u00a0large one, totaling $4 billion) in Anthropic with chief rival Google.\nBesides the recent departure of Howard Wright, AWS' head of startups, who managed startup relationships at the org, a hurdle in Amazon's way is growing scrutiny from regulators over Big Tech's investments in AI startups.\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission recently opened an inquiry on Microsoft's backing of OpenAI, as well as Google and Amazon's investments in Anthropic. European policymakers have signaled they're skeptical of such deals as well.\n"

        "Text": "US retailer Amazon's same-day delivery site in Sacramento, California, has secured zero carbon certification from the International Living Future Institute (ILFI), a third-party certified standard for lower-carbon buildings.\nThe facility, known as SCA5, is the first fulfilment centre or logistics site in North America to receive such recognition from ILFI.\nOpened in 2022, the facility is strategically located to fulfil deliveries as early as five hours after purchase.\nAmazon's SCA5 incorporates sustainable features such as lower-carbon concrete, recycled asphalt and a fully electrified HVAC [heating, ventilation and air conditioning] system.\nIts design includes a white roof to minimise heat absorption and smart irrigation systems to conserve water.\nThe retailer is installing solar panels which will generate up to 80% of the building's annual electricity consumption.\nAmazon chief sustainability officer Kara Hurst said: \"At Amazon, we are laser-focused on reaching our Climate Pledge commitment by 2040 \u2014 and our buildings are a big piece of this puzzle.\n\u201cThis facility is not only delivering for our customers within hours of their order, but was also built to reduce its environmental impact. We are challenging ourselves to think big and design Amazon\u2019s buildings in a way that helps lead the industry toward decarbonisation.\"\nTo secure certification, SCA5 had to meet stringent requirements over 12 months, including energy efficiency performance targets and being powered by 100% renewable energy.\nThe certification also mandates carbon neutralisation through additional climate solution financing in the voluntary carbon market.\nInternational Living Future Institute CEO Lindsay Baker said: \"This project sets a new high bar for construction projects in its class around the world. Committed companies like Amazon can drive the decarbonisation of the building industry and show other companies how to act now to reduce supply chain carbon emissions.\"\nAmazon recently replaced 95% of plastic air pillows with paper filler in its North American delivery packaging.\n\"Amazon SCA5 same-day delivery site gains ILFI zero carbon certification\" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Text": "Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - June 7, 2024) - First Hydrogen Corp. (TSXV: FHYD) (OTC: FHYDF) (FSE: FIT)\u00a0(\"FIRST HYDROGEN\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the company has reached a milestone as its hydrogen-powered-fuel-cell vehicle (FCEV) has completed a successful trial with Amazon (see news release May 6, 2024). The trial took place in London, UK, with the FCEV accumulating 535 km (332 miles), delivering 3,462 packages with 1,547 stops. Amazon confirmed the FCEV performed well during the trial; the FCEV was used in 8-10 hour shifts that included frequent stops. As a result of trials to date, improvements in design and predictive behaviour (AI) will be implemented to maximize payload and performance. Building on the success of the real-world trials and showcasing our hydrogen-as-a-service model (HASS), through partnerships, the Company will expand its trials to Europe and North America.\nTelematics data was downloaded and analyzed daily by Amazon's Data Science team to evaluate FCEV performance in various conditions. The delivery cycle with frequent start-stops and the influence of driver behaviour on energy efficiency and recovery provides data analysts with real-world metrics. Based on data, the projected range of the Company's FCEV under these conditions is 397 km (247 miles). First Hydrogen's engineers believe the range can be improved to greater than 450 km (280 miles) with further improvements before needing to refuel.\nThe human influence (driver) provided essential factors to the data, as drivers run over curbs, shift to Park before the vehicle comes to a full stop, do not slow down when driving over speed bumps, potholes or bumpy roads and some drive aggressively. The data recorded during the trial provided both First Hydrogen and Amazon engineers analytics to compare hydrogen-powered fuel cells versus battery electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles. First Hydrogen engineers are able to use the data to implement additional developments:\nPredictive softwareUsed to manage energy to optimize power split and system efficiency, analyze customer drive cycles to provide best routes. The Company's AI algorithm will incorporate data such as delivery stops, traffic information, weather conditions and drivers to improve vehicle efficiency and predefine delivery routes.\nPedal controller tuningDuring short and dynamic drop-off drives, driving style plays a role in the overall hydrogen consumption. The FCV driving program can be set to different settings to optimize efficiency for highway, city driving, parcel delivery, etc. The FCEV encourages regenerative braking and allows gentle acceleration.\nDesign a new operation modeAncillary power consumption during vehicle drop-off stops contributes to higher total energy consumption. The FCEV will implement a new operating mode lowering ancillary power and automatically switching the vehicle off after the FCEV has stopped for a number of minutes to reduce energy consumption.\nAbout First Hydrogen Corp. (FirstHydrogen.com)First Hydrogen Corp. is a Vancouver, Montreal and London UK-based company focused on zero-emission vehicles, green hydrogen production and distribution. The Company has designed and built hydrogen-fuel- cell-powered light commercial vehicles (\"FCEV\") in partnership with AVL Powertrain and Ballard Power Systems Inc. The FCEV has a range of 630+ kilometres. These vehicles are being trialled with fleet operators in the United Kingdom.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs AMZN Worth Investing In?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.58.\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon.

        "Author": "  Will Ashworth ",
        "Text": "Downtown Josh Brown, the CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, appeared on CNBC\u2019s Halftime Show on June 4. Brown admitted that he doubled his stake in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock.\n\u201cAmazon is right now selling at 18 times enterprise value to EBITDA,\u201d Brown said while appearing on the show. \u201cThe three-year median is more like 22, the five-year median is 25, and the 10-year median is 30. This is the cheapest you have been able to buy Amazon stock in quite some time.\u201d\nAccording to Brown, not only is its stock cheap, but it will lead the AI revolution. He certainly makes an interesting argument for this, including reminding investors that the employee head count reduction to remedy overtiring during the pandemic has righted its operating expenses relative to its revenues and growth.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nHe\u2019s doubled down. You should, too. Here\u2019s why.\nIf you bought AMZN stock five years ago, you barely doubled your money. If you bought AMZN stock at the end of 2022, you would have also doubled your money, only 43 months faster. That speaks to the turnaround Brown alluded to in his CNBC commentary.\nI\u2019ve written about Amazon five times in 2024. In all four previous articles, I was very bullish about its business. I don\u2019t intend to change my stripes. Josh Brown\u2019s comments only cement my belief that its best days are still ahead.\nAs I see it, it\u2019s got additional revenue streams that have barely scratched the surface.\nIn my May article, I pointed out that CEO Andy Jassy boldly moved to replace the head of AWS, its highly profitable cloud business. The new CEO, Matt Garman, has been with AWS for a long time. Jassy trusts Garman will accelerate the company\u2019s push into AI.\nThat\u2019s just one area where Amazon can skyrocket. As Brown suggested, it\u2019s got plenty of levers to pull.\nI\u2019m glad Brown mentioned Amazon has the third-largest advertising platform in the world, a distinction it secured in just the past couple of years.\nIn October 2023, I suggested that its advertising business could become more important than Amazon Prime. Today, the membership is over 230 million worldwide, with about three-quarters of them in the U.S. A decade ago, it had about one-tenth of what it does today.\nLo-and-behold, in May, I wrote that Amazon Prime now contributes to the ad business after the company started introducing targeted ads into Prime Video. If you don\u2019t want to watch the ads, you can pay $2.99 monthly to avoid them. Between these monthly fees and the ads, Prime Video is expected to generate $3 billion annually in new revenue.\nConsidering all the benefits the company gains from its Prime membership, including the fact that members spend more than double what nonmember spends on Amazon products and services.\nOn its own, the Amazon ad business could be a large public company.\nThe fantastic thing about Brown\u2019s EV/EBITDA numbers is that it has many more revenue generators today than it had 10 years ago, yet the multiple is 40% lower than in 2014.\nAnother value metric: Amazon\u2019s earnings per share growth over the next 3-5 years is projected to be 23% annually. Based on a P/E of 50, its PEG ratio is 2.2, 21% lower than its 5-year average.\nBrown rightly points out that Amazon stock has been underperforming for several years.\nI don\u2019t know if that has anything to do with investors still associating it with low-margin e-commerce sales, but its operating margin of 10.7% in Q1 2024 was the highest in its history. Further, its operating cash flow in the trailing 12 months ended March 31 was $99.1 billion, 82% higher than a year earlier.\nIt is printing money. It\u2019s an excellent buy at these prices.\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Author": "  FRANK WILKES LESNEFSKY, The Times-Tribune, Scranton, Pa. ",
        "Text": "OLYPHANT \u2014 Amazon is expanding its presence in the Midvalley.\nThe e-commerce giant plans to open a 1-million-square-foot warehouse at 1300 Corporate Way in Olyphant later this year, just a few miles from its existing 1-million-square-foot warehouse in the Valley View Business Park in Jessup, which shipped its first order in September 2021.\nThe new facility is slated to launch in time for the holiday season, and Amazon anticipates hiring several hundred people to staff it, Amazon spokeswoman Smitha Rao said in an email.\nHourly pay for Amazon employees across its customer fulfillment and transportation network currently ranges from $17 to $28 per hour, with the average pay for customer fulfillment and operations roles being $20.50-plus an hour \u2014 a more than 50% increase over five years, Rao said. She touted the new facility as providing career advancement opportunities; anytime access to earned pay; health, vision and dental insurance from the first day on the job; a 401(k) plan with a company match; and up to 20 weeks of paid pregnancy/parental leave for birth parents with six weeks for eligible supporting parents, among other offerings.\nKnown as an \u201cinbound crossdock,\u201d the facility stores large orders of the types of inventory that Amazon expects to quickly sell, Rao said, explaining it holds inventory for fulfillment centers.\n\u201cThink of it as a fulfillment center for fulfillment centers,\u201d she said.\nInbound crossdocks help to ensure Amazon is able to place in-demand inventory near customers, Rao said.\nBy comparison, the Jessup site is a fulfillment center specializing in larger items, Rao said.\nTo date, Amazon has facilities throughout Pennsylvania, including around Northeast Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Erie and Altoona, totaling more than 25,000 employees and a $21.6 billion investment into the state since 2010, Rao said.\n\u201cWe look forward to continuing to be a part of the community and being a good neighbor,\u201d she said.\nThe upcoming warehouse is the most recent development in a surge of warehousing and industry to target the Midvalley and Upvalley, with officials often pointing to the region\u2019s close proximity to major interstates as a key selling point.\nOnline pet-product supplier Chewy.com opened a 700,000-square-foot warehouse in the Valley View Business Park in Archbald in 2020; Canpack Group's massive Olyphant aluminum can production facility at 1400 E. Lackawanna Ave. became fully operational in 2022; pet food firm Blue Buffalo opened a 750,000-square-foot warehouse along Route 247 across from Alberigi Drive in Jessup in recent years; the upcoming Triboro Industrial Park around Route 247, Marshwood Road and the Casey Highway in Olyphant advertises more than 4.5 million square feet across four warehouses; and developers plan to build additional sprawling warehouses on mine-scarred land in Archbald, Mayfield and Carbondale Twp. along Meredith Street and the Casey Highway. A developer also bought nearly 90 acres in Jessup and Archbald earlier this year for 765,000 square feet of industrial facilities.\nThis likely won't be Amazon's last warehouse in Northeast Pennsylvania, said Penn's Northeast President and CEO John Augustine. Penn's Northeast is a collective aiming to promote new investments, jobs and business opportunities by promoting Northeast Pennsylvania.\n\"That location has not typically seen the amount of warehouse-distribution activity like the Hazleton area has,\" Augustine said, calling it a relatively new frontier in recent years.\nAugustine believes Lackawanna County's closer proximity to the New England market contributes to the development. The region is one day's drive from a third of the United States population and half of Canada's, he said.\nOlyphant Council President Jimmy Baldan said he\u2019s proud the borough was able to attract a Fortune 500 company like Amazon.\n\u201cWith a company coming in like this, I\u2019m so happy that they\u2019re going to have so many jobs \u2014 good-paying jobs \u2014 that keep our young in the valley here,\u201d Baldan said.\nTo attract developers, municipalities often grant 10-year tax breaks through the state\u2019s Local Economic Revitalization Tax Assistance Act. LERTAs are intended to incentivize development on deteriorated land by lowering the property taxes a developer has to pay on improvements to the property.\nOlyphant previously approved a 10-year LERTA where Amazon will only pay 5% of property taxes on improvements in year one, increasing by 5% annually through the 10th year. When the LERTA ends, Amazon will pay 100% of its property taxes.\nHowever, because Olyphant supplies its own electricity, the warehouse \u201creally gives our electric company, Olyphant Electric Company, a great boost,\u201d Baldan said.\nLocated near the exit of the Amazon warehouse at 1454 E. Lackawanna Ave., Armenti's Pizzeria owner Joe Hetsko said in an email he has been eagerly anticipating Amazon's opening since taking over the restaurant in April. Armenti's opened in April 2011, he said.\n\"We\u2019ve already have seen an uptick in business over the past few weeks and given our proximity to their location, I expect to see an increase as the Amazon team members are headed in and out of work,\" he said.\nAmazon workers need housing and places to eat and shop, coinciding with Olyphant\u2019s efforts to revitalize its downtown, Baldan said.\n\u201cI see prosperity for Olyphant,\u201d he said.\n"

        "Author": "  Daniel Wiessner ",
        "Text": "By Daniel Wiessner\n(Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday tossed out a judge's order that required Amazon.com to refrain from firing union supporters amid a nationwide organizing campaign at its warehouses.\nA three-judge panel of the Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the judge who issued the order last year at the request of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) failed to explain why such a sweeping mandate was necessary.\nThe labor board sought the order after Amazon in 2020 fired Gerald Bryson, a union organizer at a warehouse in Staten Island, for making profane comments to a coworker during a protest over an alleged lack of safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe warehouse, known as JFK8, in 2022 became the first Amazon facility to unionize. Amazon workers at two other New York warehouses and one in Alabama have since voted against unionizing.\nU.S. District Judge Diane Gujarati in Brooklyn ruled that Bryson's firing violated his rights under U.S. labor law and barred Amazon from terminating other union supporters. But the judge refused to order Amazon to reinstate Bryson, saying there was no evidence that his firing deterred other workers from unionizing.\nThe 2nd Circuit on Wednesday said the requirement that Amazon not fire other workers was unnecessary if there was no evidence that Bryson's firing had a broader impact.\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An NLRB spokeswoman declined to comment.\nThe labor board had sought a court injunction against Amazon pending the outcome of a related administrative case over Bryson's firing.\nAmazon claims that it fired Bryson over his conduct at the protest and not because of his support for the union. A video of the protest showed Bryson calling a female coworker a \"crackhead\" and \"stupid,\" among other comments.\nSome Republican lawmakers criticized the Democrat-led NLRB for pursuing the case, citing Bryson's conduct.\nAn administrative judge in 2022 ordered Amazon to reinstate Bryson and the company appealed.\nThe five-member board last year remanded the case to the judge to apply a new legal standard the board had adopted for cases where employees engage in misconduct while exercising their rights to organize. The judge again ruled against Amazon in January.\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Alexia Garamfalvi and Bill Berkrot)\n"

        "Author": "  Maleha Afzal ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Brad Gerstner. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other tech stocks.\nOn December 1, 2023, Brad Gerstner, the CEO of Altimeter Capital, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he explained that tech stocks are expected to outperform non-tech stocks in 2024. Over the past 10 years, tech earnings have compounded at almost 16% and non-tech earnings have compounded at 6%. 2023 was a rebound year for the tech industry after a downturn in 2022 due to rising interest rates. Big Tech companies and their operational efficiencies have poised them for strong growth. While inflation and interest rates will determine what goes down, companies that have invested in augmented intelligence will experience secular growth. Gerstner thinks that the spread between 16% and 6% will be a recurring trend in 2024.\nOn June 11, Brad Gerstner made another appearance on CNBC and\u00a0addressed the speculation surrounding the software industry. Gerstner suggested that despite headwinds, the software industry is still valuable as companies and startups are still making deals. Gerstner believes there are three main reasons for the downward trajectory of the software industry. He thinks that CEOs and CTOs are cautious when it comes to making investments in software. Executives want a clearer picture of the AI boom before making risky investments. Moreover, interest rates are higher than expectations, due to delayed rate cuts and compressing multiples. Lastly, general uncertainty about the future has been detrimental to the growth of the software industry. Gerstner pointed out that since the software industry is trading at 20% below its ten-year average, this may be the best time to allocate stakes in software companies. You can also take a look at the best Robinhood stocks under $20.\nGerstner thinks data and databases are extremely vital to AI applications. He thinks that companies using data to power AI are far ahead of companies simply automating services. Big Tech companies have data at the forefront of all their artificial intelligence applications. You can also read our piece on the stocks hedge funds are crazy about right now.\nBrad Gerstner is bullish on tech, and particularly software and AI. In Q1 2024, he initiated 6 new positions and also raised his stakes in 2 stocks, ending the quarter with a portfolio of $6.5 billion in 13F securities. With that, let's discuss his top tech stock picks.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nWe scanned Altimeter Capital's Q1 portfolio and picked growth stocks from the fund\u2019s top 13F holdings. Additionally, we\u2019ve also added overall hedge fund sentiment, as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNote: All pricing data is as of June 28.\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nAltimeter Capital's Stake Value: $271,887,676\u00a0\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks seventh on our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to Brad Gerstner. Gerstner increased his position in the stock by 21% in the first quarter of 2021. Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue expanded by 17.2% in Q1 2024, up from 13.2% in Q4 2023. Amazon claims the growth in generative AI has fueled demand for AWS, as customers are excited to try out new features to enhance their experience. Over the next 2 decades, the company anticipates developing Generative AI products from scratch and on the cloud. Overall, capital expenditures by the company amounted to $48.4 billion in 2023 and $14 billion in Q1 2024. For 2024, the company plans to invest $10 billion to establish two data centers in Mississippi. This is the single largest investment made in the state and will create over 1,000 jobs. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also intends to invest over $5.3 billion in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and more than $5 billion in Mexico over the next few years. The investment is all0cated to launch new infrastructure regions and provide better choices for end users.\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the most popular stocks among investors, with 302 hedge fund holders at the close of Q1 2024, up from 293 positions in Q4 2023. Total stakes amounted to $60.37 billion. Based on median price targets from 65 analysts, the stock has an upside of 11%, from its current price of $197.85. Analysts hold a consensus Buy opinion on AMZN and the stock has surged 32% year-to-date.\nGerstner likes Amazon because of the company\u2019s inclination to efficiency and meaningful expenditure on software. On February 2, Brad Gerstner appeared in an interview on CNBC, where he shed light on his bullish stance on AMZN. He emphasized the role of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in uplifting the stock. He believes that Amazon\u2019s dominant position in retail will benefit from AI as the company would be able to focus on targeted ads. Here are some comments from the interview:\n\"I give a tremendous amount of credit to Andy Jassy and the team there they're the market leader in cloud. We talk about them as coming from behind. They have a dominant retail business which is going to benefit from AI, from better targeting, better targeting of ads, and merchandise, and I think Jassy will drive efficiency in that business. Aws is the market leader I was concerned and some others were whether or not Microsoft's early lead and their relationship with OpenAI would force them to leave Amazon and go to Azure to take advantage of the benefits of Openai we didn't see that we saw almost no customer churn.\"\nOverall AMZN ranks 7th on our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to Brad Gerstner. You can visit 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Brad Gerstner to see the other tech stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

With that in mind, the ROCE of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Amazon.com, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.13 = US$47b \u00f7 (US$531b - US$153b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nTherefore, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 13%. That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 11% generated by the Multiline Retail industry.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nIn the above chart we have measured Amazon.com's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Amazon.com  for free.\nThe trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has employed 230% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 13%. 13% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Amazon.com has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.\nIn the end, Amazon.com has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So even though the stock might be more \"expensive\" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.\nIf you're still interested in Amazon.com it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation for AMZN  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.\nWhile Amazon.com may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0Israel Englander\u00a0is one of the most notable hedge fund managers in America. He founded Millennium Management back in 1989. Today, the fund\u2019s portfolio is worth over $234 billion. Englander nabbed the top spot in Bloomberg\u2019s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2023, with a whopping $2.8 billion in net earnings including gains from personal investments and fees. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Izzy Englander\u2019s Millennium Management earned $600 million from commodities investments last year. However, in a separate report, the publication said despite installing a new chief of its commodities and making big changes, Millennium\u2019s commodities business is lagging behind Citadel (of billionaire Ken Griffin) which made a whopping $8 billion from commodities in 2022. Bloomberg said, citing sources, that part of the reason why Millennium is struggling to post big gains is billionaire Englander\u2019s imposition of \u201ctight guardrails\u201d to limit losses. \u00a0To make money in the commodities business, experts say, you have to take risks and give some freedom to traders. But Englander likes to be in control. \u00a0A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices. Yet Englander owns 100% of the firm.\nThe report said, citing a person who works at the fund, that this major concentration is \u201cnot a good idea.\u201d\nThe FT report said Englander\u2019s fund was up 8.3% in 2023 through October, while it returned 12.5% in 2022,\u00a0 13.6% in 2021 and an impressive 25.9% in 2020.\nFor this article, we scanned Millennium Management\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund\u2019s top 10 holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management\nBillionaire Israel Englander\u2019s Stake Value:\u00a0$1,779,205,187\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\nHowever, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) skeptics believe the stock has run too much as its valuation is high. For value-conscious investors the market is indeed teeming with other opportunities. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) replaced MSFT to take the spot of the most popular stock among the over 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. A total of 302 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon\u2019s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack \u2013 infrastructure with NVIDIA\u2019s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list of Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. You can visit Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024 to see other stocks in the list. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Zuckerberg's Quiet Retail Takeover: Facebook Marketplace Has 4x Customers More Than Amazon",
        "Author": "  Adrian Volenik ",
        "Text": "For some, it\u2019s surprising; for others, not so much. Facebook Marketplace is now a genuine contender to eBay, Amazon, Craigslist, and other online marketplaces and e-commerce sites. It has been for quite some time.\nAccording to Fortune, Marketplace had more than 15 times more monthly active users (MAUs) than Craigslist in 2017 \u2014 800 million versus 55 million. According to a report from Capital One Shopping, that rose to 1.2 billion today. On the other hand, the e-commerce giant Amazon had 310 million monthly users in 2023, and eBay had 132 million active buyers worldwide. Regarding active users, Zuckerberg\u2019s Marketplace undoubtedly overshadows them as it has experienced rapid growth and now has tremendous reach.\nDon't Miss:\nA startup that turns videos into games gets backing from Mark Cuban and opens a round for regular investors at $250.\nExecutives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can coinvest in at $1.15 per share.\nLaunched in 2016, it has become a key player in the online marketplace industry, offering a user-friendly platform integrated into the widely-used Facebook app. This integration has provided convenience and accessibility since its inception, making it easier for users to buy and sell items within their social network. The Marketplace also benefited plenty from Facebook\u2019s advanced algorithm and data analytics, which resulted in more targeted advertisements and personalized user experiences.\nHowever, perhaps the most important advantage is that it\u2019s associated with a huge brand: Facebook. Although the name has been connected to many controversies over the years, it still conveys a trust factor in many people\u2019s eyes.\nWhat started as a simple way for neighbors to sell their unwanted items has ballooned into an e-commerce giant in recent years. But is there any money in it for its parent company, Meta?\nTrending: A groundbreaking energy company plugs into the $400 billion EV industry and is seeking investors.\nMeta generates revenue from Facebook Marketplace primarily through advertising and transaction fees. Since 2018, businesses and individual sellers have paid to promote their listings, which increases visibility and reach among potential buyers. These ads appear within the Marketplace interface, much like regular Facebook ads, and can be targeted using Facebook's sophisticated advertising algorithms.\nMeta also charges fees on certain types of transactions. For instance, when a sale is made through Marketplace\u2019s shipping option, Meta collects a 10% or $0.80 per listing for items sold.\nThere\u2019s yet to be an exact figure for how much revenue this generates for Meta. However, we know that Meta\u2019s advertising revenue totaled $134.9 billion in 2023, with a net income of $39 billion. Even if the company isn\u2019t exactly raking in billions of dollars from this side of the business, it is providing a lot of valuable data for targeted advertising and keeping users coming back to the Facebook website.\nScams on Facebook Marketplace are an unfortunate reality that buyers and sellers need to watch out for \u2014 from fake listings and payment scams to phishing and nondelivery scams.\nAs the BBB reported in 2022, some scams include nonexisting big-ticket items like electronics, iPhones, or even cars and RVs where the supposed seller asks the buyer to first wire the money or send funds via Zelle, CashApp, Venmo, or a similar service. The seller and the third-party service are a con, and the item doesn\u2019t exist. The buyer sends the whole amount, part of it that serves as a deposit or inputs their bank details into a fake website.\nIf you have ever tried selling something on this platform, or any other, for that matter, you know precisely how rife they are with scammers of all kinds.\nDespite challenges like scams, Facebook Marketplace continues to thrive, providing Meta with significant revenue opportunities and valuable user data, solidifying its position as a major player in the e-commerce landscape.\nKeep Reading:\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare?\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Zuckerberg's Quiet Retail Takeover: Facebook Marketplace Has 4x Customers More Than Amazon originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Author": "  Josephine Nesbit ",
        "Text": "If you frequently shop online, you\u2019ve probably heard of the e-commerce site called Temu. The Chinese-owned marketplace isn\u2019t exactly known for its quality, but you may be able to find some genuine items that rival Amazon prices.\nCheck Out: Don\u2019t Waste Your Money on These 5 Unreliable Appliance Brands\nRead Next: How To Get $340 Per Year Cash Back on Gas and Other Things You Already Buy\nAccording to ZDNET, Temu is the number one shopping app in Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play store. The store offers almost everything you can think of, including clothing, bags, appliances, furniture, power tools and much more. Temu is a legitimate website, but some shoppers have said that the items they\u2019ve ordered look different on the website or were lower quality than expected.\nAmazon may soon be using supply-chain operations by directly shipping some off-brand items from China to the U.S., according to an Amazon presentation viewed by The Wall Street Journal. But right now, you may be able to find a much better deal by shopping through Temu.\nHere are the best deals on legit items that are cheaper on Temu than on Amazon.\nBamboo sleepers aren\u2019t cheap. Even on Amazon, this highly-rated Kyte zipper closure bamboo footies cost between $35 and $40 each. Temu sells a variety of similar bamboo sleepers for around $10 each, like this popular Miozing infant bamboo fiber sleeper with an all-over bear print.\nIn a video, YouTuber Filosophy purchased newborn bamboo sleepers from Temu and said the quality is comparable to that of more expensive brands you can find on Amazon.\nJudging by the online photo alone, Temu and Amazon sell the same exact four-pack of fake potted plants. On Temu, the plants sell for $6.83 and for $9.99 on Amazon (originally priced at $14.99). However, YouTuber Oh!MGlashes reviewed both products and said Temu\u2019s product was significantly smaller than Amazon\u2019s. If you don\u2019t mind the size difference, then Temu may be the better option.\nIt\u2019s never too early to get a jump start on back-to-school shopping. Temu sells a variety of school and office supplies, including this pack of four zipper transparent pencil cases for $6.98. Amazon sells the same pack of cases for almost double the price at around $11.99. Reviews on Temu said the bags were better than expected, and you can use them for school supplies, makeup, sewing items or as a small travel bag.\nBrushes are a frequently purchased item on Temu, and this natural bamboo hair brush is only $0.78 on Temu. The closest match on Amazon is $7.97. In a video review, YouTuber Jordan Budgets said the Temu brush is much smaller, but the one from Temu is well-made. Unless you have thicker hair, the Temu brush will work just as well as what you\u2019d find on Amazon.\nPhone cases are another popular item on Temu; most cost under $5. This clear iPhone case is only $1.28 on Temu and has thousands of shopper reviews. Amazon also sells a variety of phone cases, but a similar case sells for $14.99 (originally priced at $18.99). Temu reviewers said the phone case was sturdy, fit the phone well and looked exactly as advertised.\nTemu and Amazon both sell a 4-in-1 universal jar opener. However, the item is listed on Temu for $1.99 and on Amazon for $9.99 (originally $19.98). Temu shoppers say this item works just how it\u2019s supposed to and has become one of the most used items in the kitchen.\nTemu sells a very similar multifunction vegetable chopper for $11.86 compared to the $19.99 (originally $29.99 ) veggie chopper on Amazon. YouTuber Oh!MGlashes purchased both items and tried both out on camera. She said the Temu version worked, but you need to push it a little bit harder to get the same results.\nStill looking for the perfect Stanley dupe? Temu sells a 40-ounce insulated travel mug with a handle, a leak-proof lid, a straw, and a stopper for $8.08. YouTuber Filosophy says this is the perfect affordable dupe and is nearly identical to the much more expensive Stanley tumbler. Similar items can be found on Amazon, such as this O\u2019Jay insulated tumbler for $16.99 (originally $34.99).\nMore From GOBankingRates\n20 Best Cities Where You Can Buy a House for Under $100K\n9 Best Items To Buy at BJ's Wholesale Club Now for the Second Half of 2024 To Save Big Money\n5 Genius Things People With Healthy Savings Do\n5 Myths About Debt That Nobody Should Believe in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 8 Legit Items That Are Cheaper On Temu Than Amazon\n"

        "Title": "Amazon study reveals most European employees favour on-the-job skills training or apprenticeships over university degrees for a successful career start",
        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "The study coincides with Amazon celebrating the ten-year anniversary of its Career Choice training programme and the announcement of \u20ac40 million in further investment in skills training for Amazon employees across Europe.\nLUXEMBOURG, June 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--More than half of European workers (54%) believe that on-the-job-skills training or apprenticeships are more valuable for preparing people for work today than traditional university degrees, a new European career insights and workplace trends study commissioned by Amazon has found. In fact, the study found that just under three quarters (73%) of workers feel there needs to be a wider range of apprenticeship or internship opportunities available to young people.\nThe Amazon Future of Work & Career Development European study, conducted by Ipsos, also found that a majority of European employees* (89%) think it\u2019s important to learn a new skill to improve or change their career path, even more so than receiving a promotion (73%). Alongside factors such as pay/salary (94%) and office/worksite location or flexible/hybrid or remote working (93%), 91% of adults say on the job training or career development training is essential or important when looking for a new job or role, and that training programmes offered by a potential employer are more important than company culture (78%). One potential reason is that many workers in the study said it would make them feel motivated (39%), encouraged (32%), valued (31%) or supported (30%) to work for a company that provides access to career development training. Additionally, almost one in five workers in Europe (19%) admit they couldn\u2019t afford to pay for training.\nAmazon has long adapted to the ever-changing career and education landscape, investing more than \u20ac100 million in training programmes in Europe since it launched its Career Choice programme in the region in 2014. The programme provides 95% of pre-paid tuition, up to \u20ac8,000 over four years, for nationally recognised courses from more than 85 schools throughout Europe. It offers various training opportunities in a range of popular, in-demand job fields, from tech and sustainability to business administration and logistics, for Amazon\u2019s hourly and salaried workers across the region.\nTo mark the ten-year anniversary of Career Choice in Europe, Amazon plans to invest \u20ac40 million in 2024 and to add more than 25 new programmes across five countries in Europe this year to support current and future job needs for the thousands of employees who participate in Career Choice. Currently, Amazon employees in Europe have access to over a hundred different programmes to help them maximise their potential within the company or outside of Amazon. Some of the new courses added in 2024 include Cloud Support, Cyber Security, Information Security, Web and Graphic Design, Mechatronics, Procurement Logistics, and Big Data, Virtualisation, and Machine Learning.\nSince its launch ten years ago, more than 40,000 Amazon employees across Europe** have participated in the programme. While some employees leave Amazon to pursue other career opportunities with their newly acquired skills and certifications from Career Choice, thousands have stayed and transitioned into new roles. The popularity of the programme continues to increase, with about one in ten of all eligible employees in Europe participating in Career Choice in 2023. Popular areas of study vary from technology and sustainability, to mechanical and industrial systems, transportation and logistics, and administration and business studies.\n\"I attribute a lot of my growth at Amazon to Career Choice,\" said Mo Abdullahi, Senior Operations Manager and Career Choice participant number four in the UK from 2014. \"It gave me an opportunity to learn more about the role that I wanted and helped me with obtaining the qualifications that I needed. I'm still super surprised of my journey and growth through Amazon. If I look back ten years ago and starting as a temporary worker, I certainly wouldn't have assumed that I would be at the level I am right now and with the responsibility I have now. It\u2019s been an incredible journey.\"\nWhen it comes to jobs in the future, the study shows that training will need to play a key role in alleviating worker concerns, as 32% of European workers are worried they won\u2019t have the training and skills to be relevant in their job in the coming years. In fact, two-thirds of European workers (67%) believe that people in the workforce today will need to continue to retrain and update their skills to continue working in the future. However, only 15% of employees say they have access to training to help them change their career path, and over one in five (22%) employees say they don\u2019t have any access to training with their current employer.\n\"The latest research and the growth of our Career Choice programme over the past ten years clearly demonstrates the strong desire for workers across the Europe to develop their careers through relevant and accessible skills training programmes,\" said Robert Marhan, Global Operations Vice President of People Experience & Technology (PXT). \"Amazon is proud to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Career Choice skills training programme in Europe and to expand the course options available, so that thousands of employees across Europe can advance their skills and take on new career opportunities both at Amazon and beyond.\"\nThe Career Choice programme is currently available to Amazon employees in Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, the U.S., and the UK. It has a rigorous selection process for third-party partner educators, choosing partners that are focused on helping employees through their education programmes, assisting them with job placements, and overall offering education that leads to career success.\nTo learn more about the Career Choice programme, visit Amazon Career Choice https://www.aboutamazon.eu/news/tag/working-at-amazon/career-choice\nSources:\n*The research was carried out by Ipsos UK on behalf of Amazon. Ipsos UK interviewed a representative quota sample of 16,482 adults using its online omnibus, and within that a sample of 9,686 employees. Fieldwork was carried out in 8 markets across Europe, including Spain, Germany, UK, France, Italy, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland. The sample achieved is representative of the population aged 16-75 in all markets except Czech Republic and Slovakia, where the participants were aged 16-65. Interlocking quotas were set on Age within Gender, and on Region and Working status. The data has been weighted to the known offline population proportions for interlocking cells of gender within age and working status, as well as region and education to reflect the adult population of each market. A country average weight was also applied. Fieldwork was carried out between the 26th April and 27th May 2024.

We are excited to continue to entertain India with the great local originals and exclusive content available across our Prime Video and miniTV services in India,\u201d an Amazon spokesperson was quoted by the Hindu Businessline as saying.\nSince early 2023, talks have been on for Amazon to purchase the Times Internet-owned MX Player.\nAround July 2023, the company called off the agreement, but in recent months, negotiations picked back up.\nThe deal values MX Player at less than $100m (Rs8.34bn), a fall from its previous $500m valuation in 2019.\nThe acquisition comes in the wake of a joint venture announcement between Walt Disney and Reliance Industries, aiming to create one of India's largest TV and digital streaming platforms.\nAmazon's interest in MX Player reflects the company's strategy to expand its streaming offerings in India, a key market for future growth.\nAmazon currently operates Prime Video, a subscription-based service, and miniTV, a free ad-supported streaming service launched in May 2021.\nIn July 2023, Amazon introduced a standalone Android app for miniTV, reporting an average of 45 minutes per session spent by viewers in December 2023.\nThrough miniTV, Amazon aims to bolster its digital advertising revenues in India.\nThe acquisition of MX Player, with its reach in tier 2 and tier 3 cities, aligns with Amazon's efforts to penetrate deeper into the Indian rural market.\nMX Player was purchased by Times Internet for Rs10bn in 2018.\n\"Amazon to acquire assets from India\u2019s MX Player \" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

But are they sacrificing cost for convenience? A recent breakdown published by CNET showed that delivery doesn\u2019t cost as much as you might think. And when you factor in costs that are variable and harder to measure, including the price of gas and impulse purchases you might be tempted to make while you\u2019re browsing the aisles, grocery delivery may actually cost less.\nThe CNET shopper compared the prices of 39 popular grocery items in a variety of categories. Whenever possible, they selected the cheaper option, which eliminated organic foods and pricey specialty items.\nThe shopper compared prices on these items at FreshDirect, Amazon Fresh, and Stop & Shop in the Northeast as the in-store location. It\u2019s important to note that Stop & Shop is a mid-range grocery store in the Northeast. It\u2019s not as inexpensive as Lidl, Aldi, or Walmart, but also not as pricey as Whole Foods or Gristede\u2019s. Also keep in mind that these prices are from the Northeast, so other regions might have lower in-store prices.\nWhen you don\u2019t count the tip or membership fee associated with online shopping, the three options came in very similar. In fact, you might be surprised to see that online shopping costs less without fees or tips.\nIt cost $196.64 to complete the shopping list at Stop & Shop, $182.27 through FreshDirect and $183.76 through Amazon Fresh. \u00a0But if you had a $20 tip to each of the delivery services, (a little more than 10% of the total order price) FreshDirect costs $202.27 and Amazon Fresh costs $203.76, putting both between $6 and $8 more.\nAmazon Fresh and FreshDirect both have delivery or membership fees associated with shopping. The cost for Amazon Prime membership, with comes with free grocery delivery, is roughly $15 a month. SNAP beneficiaries and students may qualify for a lower cost membership. If you subscribe to Amazon Prime for all the other benefits, including streaming and fast, free delivery on other items, you may not want to factor this into your grocery costs. If you only use your Prime membership for grocery delivery and you shop every two weeks, it\u2019s $7.50 per trip for delivery.\nFreshDirect charges a flat rate of $6 per delivery or you can subscribe to a delivery plan for $6.50 per month, adding just $3.25 to each delivery if you shop every two weeks.\nThese delivery costs put the price of FreshDirect up to $205.52 and the price for Amazon Fresh up to $211.26.\nYou can expect to pay between $5 and $15 more for grocery delivery compared to shopping in a mid-priced store, depending on how much you choose to tip and what delivery service you use.\nIf you\u2019re inclined to make impulse purchases in a grocery store rather than sticking to your list, that price difference could be as small as one bag of family-size potato chips.\nLearn More: 6 Expensive Costco Items That Are Definitely Worth the Cost\nGrocery delivery doesn\u2019t just save time.

        "Text": "Amazon.com's plan to launch a discount shopping section would appeal to mainland Chinese suppliers with pricing flexibility, but competing with Temu and Shein in selling low-priced merchandise will not be easy, according to analysts.\nThe US e-commerce giant told Chinese merchants in an invite-only meeting on Wednesday that this new online budget marketplace will feature non-branded fashion items, household goods and daily necessities, which will ship directly to consumers from warehouses on the mainland in nine to 11 days.\nThat plan, first reported by online tech publication The Information, has already made a splash within China's cross-border e-commerce community, where heated discussions centred around joining this marketplace and related Amazon policies. This programme, however, is only open to select sellers.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\"The initial feedback from Chinese merchants has been quite positive even though Amazon has yet to officially launch the new programme,\" said Wang Xin, executive chairwoman of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association.\nSelect mainland Chinese merchants have been invited by Amazon.com to joint its new discount-shopping marketplace. Photo: Reuters alt=Select mainland Chinese merchants have been invited by Amazon.com to joint its new discount-shopping marketplace. Photo: Reuters>\nAmazon's new discount marketplace resembles the budget e-commerce model of platforms like Temu, which work closely with Chinese suppliers in marketing and shipping dirt-cheap goods directly to global consumers.\nMerchants under Amazon's new programme can set product prices by themselves, which deviates from the Temu model, according to Wang. She said this is likely to appeal to mainland cross-border merchants and exporters - especially those who have worked with Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop - with the manufacturing capabilities, cash flow, talent and supply chain to make a difference for Amazon.\nThe US company's planned foray into the discount-shopping market segment shows a renewed effort to broaden its \"Made in China, sold on Amazon\" community, as many mainland suppliers struggle to boost their profits amid fierce competition between discount-shopping platforms.\n\"By leaving pricing in the hands of sellers, Amazon has offered a crucial way for them to maintain profitability,\" Wang said.\nAmazon.com's discount-shopping initiative is expected to attract suppliers who have worked with rival platforms Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1stT on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has said in a fresh note that major tech giants are now running in a \u201crace\u201d to capture the $4 trillion AI market, calling GPUs the new \u201coil\u201d or \u201cgold\u201d in the technology sector. Ives said that the AI \u201cparty\u201d is just getting started and the clock is showing \u201c9p.m. in a party going till 4 a.m. with the rest of the tech world now joining.\u201d Ives thinks spending on GPUs and data centers is the \u201conly game in town.\u201d Ives thinks the \u201cfirst wave\u201d of AI benefited major technology giants leading the AI race, with the second, third and fourth \u201cderivatives\u201d beginning to show trickle-down effects on other companies.\nIn a separate investing event, Ives recently predicted that the AI-led bull run can last for another two to three years, saying in a year from now investors will be looking at $3 trillion to $4 trillion market caps for major tech companies.\n\u201cThe tech bull market is just starting,\u201d Ives reportedly said.\nIn his latest note Ives highlighted several stocks which he believes can benefit from the AI revolution. In this article we take a detailed look at these stocks and discuss their AI-related growth catalysts and see whether or not they are sound long-term investments. With each stock we have mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nAlexander Supertramp / Shutterstock.com\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0doesn\u2019t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled \u201cchatbot recommendations\u201d as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0strength in the application layer of AI.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is experiencing a surge in profitability, reflected in significantly higher retail profit margins. Strategic cost reductions in headcount and fulfillment have materialized into financial gains. While the unexpected pandemic-driven demand surge necessitated a rapid expansion of fulfillment infrastructure, this initially impacted operating profits. However, current unit sales growth has effectively reached equilibrium with fulfillment capacity. This balance is leading to positive adjustments to both earnings and intrinsic value estimates. Should the economic climate continue to improve, we believe Amazon\u2019s investment potential aligns with its projected 15-20% intrinsic value growth trajectory.\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 12 Best AI Stocks Leading the \u2018Big Tech Race\u2019 to $4 Trillion According to a Famous Wall Street Analyst. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Meghan Hall ",
        "Text": "Amazon\u2018s practices around data and algorithms may have Prime-d it for legal trouble\u2014again.\nThe British Independent Retailers Association (BIRA) brought the \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion) claim against the e-commerce giant Thursday, alleging that it illegally misused British retailers\u2019 data to furnish its own profits. BIRA filed the action with the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) in London.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nSenators Admonish Amazon for 'Evasive' Response to DSP Program Inquiry\nWhat the Teamsters Team-up Means for the Amazon Labor Union\nAmazon Joins Worker Safety Program. But Is It Enough?\nAccording to BIRA, Amazon has used \u201cdata that is non-public and belongs solely and specifically to the retailers\u201d selling on its UK marketplace to help the company determine which new product areas it should enter to turn more profits. That, the organization contends, is based on information like earnings and sales potential, how to out-price existing offerings and more.\nBIRA says that once Amazon has used retailers\u2019 proprietary data to add products into its sprawling assortment it then uses the Buy Box function to promote its own offerings to consumers at lower prices than existing listings.\nThe Buy Box is coveted real estate on Amazon, because it\u2019s where the vast majority of sales come from. Amazon\u2019s algorithms select one seller\u2019s listing for a product to promote above the others, based on a variety of considerations.\n\u201cBy misusing their proprietary data to bring to market rival products that are sold cheaper, Amazon is effectively pushing many of the UK\u2019s independent retailers out of the market,\u201d the organization said. \u201cThe consequences of Amazon\u2019s abusive conduct has been to inflate its profits and harm the UK retail sector, especially the smaller independent retailers who are struggling at a time of difficult economic circumstances.\u201d\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the company believes the claims outlined are untrue.\n\u201cWe have not seen this complaint, but based on the reporting so far we are confident that it is baseless and that this will be exposed in the legal process,\u201d the spokesperson told Sourcing Journal in a statement. \u201cOver 100,000 small and medium sized businesses in the UK sell on Amazon\u2019s store, more than half of all physical product sales on our UK store are from independent selling partners and the fact is that we only succeed when the businesses we work with succeed.\u201d\nBIRA\u2019s allegations are far from the first. In 2022, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an investigation into the company, stating that it had taken advantage of its position in the market by favoring its own services over third-party sellers on the marketplace. Amazon made an agreement with the CMA to freeze the probe. The company did the same with the European Commission when pressed.\nSimilarly, the U.S.\u2019s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought a lawsuit against Amazon, backed by 17 state attorneys, general, alleging that the company \u201cuses a set of interlocking anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power\u201d and squanches the hopes of other sellers trying to earn profit on the marketplace side of the business.\nGovernments and retailers aren\u2019t the only ones scrutinizing Bezos\u2019 baby. In February, U.S. consumers brought a class-action lawsuit against Amazon, alleging that it exercises too much control over the Buy Box, \u201cnudge or trick [consumers] into purchasing higher-priced offers despite the availability of lower-priced offers for the same product with equal or better estimated delivery times.\u201d\nAccording to BIRA, the collective action claim is the largest to be filed under the UK\u2019s Competition Act of 1998.\nA collective action functions similarly to a class action in the United States, but the main difference is that, in a collective action, afflicted parties have to opt in to participating; in a class action, parties have to opt out if they do not want to be included. BIRA estimates that about 35,000 retailers in the UK could be eligible to participate in this particular action.\nMany of those retailers are small businesses, it claims. No matter the size of the retailer, though, Amazon charges a 30 percent commission on products sold through the site, BIRA said.\nAlready, that docks the profit retailers can turn on the marketplace, which may seem like a necessary evil to retailers who would miss out on making sales if they migrated off of Amazon, said Andrew Goodacre, BIRA\u2019s chief executive.\n\u201cOne might ask, why would an independent retailer use Amazon if it is so damaging to their business? In reality, we have seen a significant shift in consumer buying behavior and, if small business[es] want to sell online, Amazon is the dominant marketplace in the UK,\u201d Goodacre said.\nThe claim could be retribution for what the retailers allege is scheme-heavy conduct from the Prime purveyor. Goodacre said he hopes that, through this action\u2014which will need to be authorized to proceed by the CAT\u2014retailers can reclaim the damages they deserve.\n\u201cThe British public has a strong relationship with its local, independent retailers, and ensuring they are not put out business by Amazon\u2019s illegal actions is a key driving force behind this collective action. The filing of the claim today is the first step toward retailers obtaining compensation for what Amazon has done,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI am confident that the CAT will authorize the claim to go forward, and I look forward to the opportunity to present the case on behalf of UK retailers. This is a watershed moment for UK retailers, but especially for small independent retailers in this country.\u201d\n"

Amazon will pay Adept a licensing fee to use some of its technology, which helps automate business functions. An Amazon spokesperson declined to disclose terms of the non-exclusive deal.\nAmazon is investing towards training an ambitious large language model, Reuters has reported, hoping it could rival top models from Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Alphabet. The new additions from Adept signal the tech giant's ambition to work on AI agents tools, an area major labs are focusing on.\nReuters reported earlier this month that Amazon is racing to update its Alexa voice assistant to fully integrate generative AI, which can respond almost instantaneously with full sentences to complicated prompts or queries.\nThe Amazon spokesperson said the Adept employees have already joined the company and about 20 Adept workers remain at the startup. Adept didn't respond to a request for comment.\nAt Amazon, Luan and a number of others will report to Rohit Prasad, who oversees artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Others will join the team developing devices and other services, according to an internal memo viewed by Reuters.\nPrasad, the former head of Alexa, who now reports directly to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, brought in researchers working on Alexa AI and the Amazon science team to work on training models, uniting AI efforts across the company with dedicated resources.\nPrasad said in the memo that the hires \"will significantly help us on our quest to achieving AGI.\"\nAdept also held discussions with other tech companies including Meta, which decided not to pursue a tie-up or partnership, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Meta declined to comment.\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger in San Francisco and Krystal Hu in New York; Additional reporting by Max Cherney in San Franisco; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri, Sayantani Ghosh, Ken Li and Cynthia Osterman)\n"

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "NEW YORK, June 12, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, the Global Cyber Alliance and Amazon announced the launch of CyberFlex, a website that helps 18- to 25-year-olds avoid scams and cybercrimes. CyberFlex contains targeted information including free tools, interactive guides, and text alerts to prevent, mitigate, report, and recover from scams and other cyber risks. CyberFlex aims to raise awareness, shift attitudes about online risks, and provide easy steps to help young adults protect themselves and share their stories.\nDeveloped with insights from a globally diverse group of young advisors, CyberFlex\u2019s themes, content, and messaging are designed specifically for 18- to 25-year-olds and will be delivered on the platforms they use. Like-minded organizations are invited to support, promote, and use CyberFlex.\n\"We assume \u2018digital natives\u2019 can avoid scams and risks online, but data shows the opposite. Instead, they are a growing target for cybercriminals. CyberFlex engages them where they live online and provides valuable resources to build a more trustworthy Internet,\" said Brian Cute, GCA's Chief Operating Officer.\n\"Scammers that attempt to impersonate trusted brands put consumers of all ages at risk,\" said Scott Knapp, Director of Worldwide Buyer Risk Prevention at Amazon. \"Amazon is committed to protecting consumers from impersonation scams and is proud to continue our collaboration with the Global Cyber Alliance to provide resources that help young adults identify, avoid, and report scams. Scammers use convincing tactics to reel people in, which is why education around scam avoidance is critical to keeping consumers safe.\"\nA Global, Collaborative Effort\nCyberFlex builds on a GCA and Amazon collaboration to foster consumer education addressing scams among young Internet users globally.\nWe conducted surveys, focus groups, and independent research on habits, risk perception, and awareness, knowledge, and personal experience with scams. We found that despite young adults\u2019 online experience, they are highly susceptible to impersonation, investment, cryptocurrency scams, and other threats. The data highlighted and validated that young adults are overconfident, confused by scams, do not report incidents, and have growing privacy concerns.\nGCA and Amazon will host webinars on June 18 and 26 with end users and industry partners, and a Japanese version of CyberFlex will launch later this year. Organizations interested in helping are urged to contact GCA.\nAbout GCA\nThe Global Cyber Alliance (GCA) is an international nonprofit dedicated to building communities to deploy tools, services, and programs that provide cybersecurity at global scale. We achieve this in three ways: working with communities; engaging infrastructure owners and operators; and driving strategic mobilizations for collective action on cybersecurity.\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240612277110/en/\nContacts\nMarina Calvo Leyvamleyva@globalcyberalliance.org\n"

        "Title": "Beyond Market Price: Uncovering Amazon.com Inc's Intrinsic Value",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-06-10, Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $80.32. It's currently trading at a price of $184.3. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -129.46%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$3.64\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.45%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n21.45\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n9.12\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n80.32\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $54.92. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -235.58%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Perhaps no two tech-oriented, consumer product companies are ingrained in U.S. consumers' everyday lives as much as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\nAmazon is the leader of e-commerce, controlling a nearly 38% market share in the U.S. It's next closest competitor is Walmart, which has a less than 7% market share.\nApple, meanwhile, is estimated to hold a more than 59% market share in the smartphone market in the U.S.; Samsung is a distant second at 23%.\nWhile both companies have dominant market positions in the U.S. in their respective fields, the question is which stock is the better buy at the moment?\nAmazon has been solidly outperforming Apple on the revenue growth front the past few quarters. The e-commerce giant has been able to grow its revenue by double digits each of the past four quarters, including by 13% last quarter to $143.3 billion.\nApple, on the other hand, has been struggling with growth. The company has only seen its revenue increase once in the past four quarters, a scant 2% gain in its December quarter. Last quarter, meanwhile, revenue fell 4% to $90.8 billion. The company has been hampered by struggling iPhone sales in China and a lengthening replacement cycle.\nBoth companies are looking toward artificial intelligence (AI) to help spur growth.\nWhile not growing as quickly as its two main cloud computing competitors, Amazon's Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment is still showing solid revenue growth, up 17% last quarter. The company plans to increase capital expenditures to expand its data center operations in order to meet the increasing demand for generative AI. The company believes this upfront investment will lead to strong free cash flow and better operating margins down the road.\nThe company is also helping customers build out their own AI solutions through its Bedrock and SageMaker platforms. With BedRock, the company is providing foundational large language models (LLMs) from both itself and AI start-ups, while SageMaker helps customers create their own AI models.\nApple, meanwhile, has just jumped into the AI race with a number of AI features that will be powered by its Apple Intelligence solution. Apple Intelligence will be incorporated into its latest operating systems and be able to be used within its own and third-party apps while maintaining user privacy. It will also be added to its voice assistant, Siri, to help with various tasks such as finding a specific photo or hotel booking information.\nThe big hope for Apple is that the new AI features will help spur a hardware upgrade cycle, as later versions of its devices are generally needed to run these AI-related functions. The company has seen upgrade cycles start to lengthen, so these new features and future AI capabilities could spur people to more quickly upgrade their smartphones and computers.\nApple stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 33, lower than Amazon's forward P/E of over 40.\nHowever, Amazon has been growing its revenue at a much faster clip than Apple, which has struggled to grow its revenue over the past 12 months. Amazon has also been seeing more earnings growth, as the company leverages fixed costs to grow its bottom line.\nBoth companies have solid balance sheets. Amazon carries about $8 billion in net cash, while Apple has a whopping $68.6 billion in net cash on its balance sheet. Apple's large cash position and prolific free cash flow give it a lot of flexibility to buy back shares, and the company recently announced an additional $110 billion share repurchase program.\nAmazon and Apple have proven to be two of the most successful companies in the world, and both should be long-term winners for investors. If I had to choose only one, I'd pick Amazon at this time given its higher growth. The company has also shown a willingness to spend a lot of cash in order to win in the past, and combined with the potential of AI, I think this will be a winning strategy.\nHowever, considering the potential of a hardware upgrade cycle due to AI, a cheaper valuation, and a boatload of cash, I wouldn't just toss Apple aside. Fortunately, investors can own both of these solid stocks if they choose.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $775,568!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>NVIDIA shares have truly emerged as the poster child for the market's AI enthusiasm. It is the chipmaker's AI leverage that has made the stock of the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world recently. The stock has lost some altitude lately, on creeping worries about the sustainability of the AI momentum and broader Tech spending trends.\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of Amazon.com have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+28.7% vs. +19.8%). The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive.Strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company\u2019s cloud dominance.

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "AWS's secure and scalable infrastructure unlocks new Agents, Generative AI Capabilities in the Zeta Marketing Platform\nNEW YORK & CANNES, France, June 19, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Zeta Global (NYSE: ZETA), the AI-Powered Marketing Cloud, today announced, at A\u2019Maison: The House of Amazon @ Cannes Lions 2024, an advancement in generative AI functionality within its Zeta Marketing Platform (ZMP) by utilizing Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service to build and scale generative AI applications with foundation models from Amazon Web Services (AWS). Zeta Creative AI Agents can combine insight and image generation within the Zeta Opportunity Engine (ZOE) to provide better outputs within the Zeta Marketing Platform.\nThe introduction of these features, coupled with Zeta\u2019s Creative AI Agents, which automate omnichannel content production, signifies a new era of control and customization. This solution combines onboarding, analysis, image generation, optimization, and customer Agent workflows to enable marketers to discover and curate audiences that they can utilize immediately. This also allows for next-generation marketer-created workflows that integrate AI-powered agents and AI. Both are designed to discover the customer journey targeted by CDP (Customer Data Platform), ESP (Email Service Provider), and DSP (Demand Side Platform), decorating it for marketers with intelligent insights.\nThis continual improvement of ZOE reflects Zeta\u2019s deep commitment to utilizing practical AI that guides marketers through customer discovery and analytics, powered by the Zeta Marketing Platform. A year after ZOE\u2019s launch, nearly 500 marketers are utilizing ZOE daily, to power campaigns with the efficiency of AI. Unlike AI tools focused on single-use cases, Zeta embeds multi-purpose LLMs, including Anthropic\u2019s Claude, across its entire platform. AWS scalability assists Zeta in increased response times and pre-processing and post-processing for agents, allowing Zeta to deliver correct and consistent responses.\n\"This collaboration enhances and extends our longstanding partnership with AWS to the forefront of the AI revolution,\" said David A. Steinberg, Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO of Zeta Global. \"Amazon Bedrock provides a best-in-class foundation for us to accelerate the development and roll-out of our Generative AI Intelligent Agent studio to deliver transformative business improvement to our customers.\"\n\"We are excited about Zeta Global\u2019s innovative use of creative Agents via Amazon Bedrock,\" said Jon Williams, Global Head of Agency Business Development for AWS. \"Zeta\u2019s generative AI platform will enable customers with highly customized personalization workflows for use cases across the customer lifecycle, from onboarding to engagement optimization.\"\nZeta utilizes Amazon Bedrock to develop proprietary AI models compliant with enterprise policies. Zeta\u2019s work with AWS began with the ZOE, which Zeta launched in 2023. Building on AWS, Zeta has worked to help give marketers answers to their most critical business questions and create AI-powered intelligent strategies. Now, customer insights are further amplified with a Multi-Model Agent Building Framework using Amazon Bedrock, which allows Zeta to leverage Stable Diffusion XL through Amazon Bedrock's Titan Image Generator model, and Anthropic Claude 3 integration, which provides the Agents with safe, accurate, and secure responses. This can be used to maximize value and ROI for Zeta\u2019s customers, helping them speed innovation beyond the mechanics of just improving workflows.\nThese tools can empower businesses across the marketing spectrum from audience insights to dynamic campaign orchestration to illuminating performance drivers. The Creative AI Agents are now in beta with general availability planned for Q3 2024.
