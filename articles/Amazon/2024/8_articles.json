        "Text": "Amazon's (AMZN) stock fell more than 8% Friday after the retail and cloud giant offered a current quarter forecast on Thursday that fell short of expectations on both the top and bottom lines.\nThe disappointing returns were amplified by a weak July jobs report, which sent the tech world and the broader market deep into the red.\nFor the third quarter, Amazon guided sales to a range of $154 billion-$158.5 billion compared to analyst forecasts for $158.43 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Its operating income in the third quarter is set to fall within a range of $11.5 billion-$15 billion. Wall Street had expected operating income to come in closer to $15.2 billion.\nThe report wrapped a wave of Big Tech results that have flashed warnings that investors have limited patience for massive AI spending. Any weakness in the core business has heightened the scrutiny on Wall Street.\nEven as Amazon brought home earnings per share (EPS) of $1.26, beating estimates of $1.04 and nearly doubling profits from the same period last year, investors focused instead on the report's weaknesses.\nAmazon generated revenue of $148 billion, a touch below the $148.8 billion that analysts expected, but even the slight miss failed to impress.\nThe company's booming advertising segment, which has routinely grown by double-digit percentages, continued to show strength, but that segment too came in just below expectations, registering $12.8 billion in revenue versus the $13 billion expected.\nA bright spot of the report came from its cloud business, Amazon Web Services. AWS raked in $26.3 billion in revenue compared to the $26 billion expected and well above the $22.1 billion during the same time last year.\nAmazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told reporters on a call after earnings that AWS is poised to generate more than $105 billion annually.\nLike several of its peers, Amazon is investing heavily in infrastructure to support the rapid deployment of new AI technologies and cloud services.\nOlsavsky said the company has spent just over $30 billion in the first half of the year on capital expenditures, owing to the growing need for AWS services, including demand for generative AI tools. Amazon expects those investments to increase for the second half of the year, he said.\nOn the ecommerce front, the everything store has drawn increasing competition from the likes of Temu and Shein, companies that specialize in low-cost goods that rely on a direct-from-factory supply chain. Amazon is reported to be developing a discount digital storefront of its own to directly compete for fashion and lifestyle spending.\n\u201cWe are seeing cautious consumers,\" Olsavsky said. \"They are looking for deals.\u201d\n\"Amazon\u2019s topline growth came in short on softer consumer spending in a quarter sandwiched between two major sales events \u2014 the Big Spring Sale in March and Prime Day in July,\" said eMarketer principal analyst Sky Canaves in a statement.\n\"Amazon will have to position its offerings and promotions to take advantage of these trends, such as with the reported plans to launch a Temu-like discount section in time for the holidays this year,\" Canaves said.\nAmazon's report arrived days after its cloud rival and AI competitor Microsoft (MSFT) beat expectations on the top and bottom lines but missed on cloud revenue, sending shares lower. Prior to that disappointment, Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) posted lower-than-expected YouTube ad revenue, which also sent investors running.\nMeta (META), on the other hand, earned the applause of Wall Street, delivering better-than-expected results for revenue and profit, even as executives warned they anticipate \"significant\" capital expenditures in 2025. Shares gained more than 4% Thursday.\nApple (AAPL) reported earnings alongside Amazon after the closing bell, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines despite a year-over-year decline in iPhone sales.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 18 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nGrowth investors have been piling into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past few months as a variety of factors, including rapid technological advancements, soaring investment, and widespread adoption across sectors drive interest towards the AI business. Some important metrics illustrate this phenomenon. The global AI market was valued at approximately $142.3 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 36%, reaching nearly $2 trillion by 2030. In 2024 alone, the AI market is expected to expand by around 40%, a pace that far outstrips the broader technology sector and the overall global economy, which is predicted to grow at a more modest 2.7%.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThis explosive growth is driven by the increasing integration of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing. Investment in AI is surging, with companies recognizing its potential to revolutionize business operations and deliver significant returns. According to PwC, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with North America and China accounting for nearly 70% of this value. In 2024, corporate investment in AI is expected to surpass $500 billion, driven by companies seeking to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate their product offerings.\nIndustry experts are increasingly bullish on the long-term prospects for AI stocks. According to a survey by Gartner, 80% of executives believe that AI will be a critical business driver by 2025, with 75% already piloting or implementing AI solutions. McKinsey estimates that AI could deliver up to $6.1 trillion in annual value across industries, primarily through automation and optimization. This growing confidence in AI capabilities is reflected in the stock market, where AI-focused companies have consistently outperformed their peers. For instance, AI-driven companies have seen their stock prices surge by over 50% in 2023 alone, a trend expected to continue as demand for AI solutions grows.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nThese AI-focused firms are also investing in AI startups as they seek to diversify their businesses. NVIDIA, Apple, and Microsoft are all reportedly considering a huge investment in OpenAI, a California-based AI firms whose claim to fame is the launch of ChatGPT back in late 2022. If the rumors are true, the latest round of funding would take the valuation of the startup to $100 billion. For some additional context, this value is higher than the combined GDPs of 110 nations, the highest for any venture capital backed firm in the US since Facebook's IPO, and the most valuable private firm in the US after Musk-owned SpaceX.\nThis high valuation also follows an emerging trend in the startup universe. Research into the domain by Coatue Management reveals that up until June 2024 year-to-date, there were a total of 200 AI-related deals in the venture capital world, compared to just 7,000 for non-AI firms. The average valuation in these deals for AI startups was around $1 billion. On the non-AI side, this value was only $200 million. The average funding round for AI firms fetched over $120 million, while this figure for non-AI companies was around $20 million. The numbers highlight that AI firms, on average, are valued at five times more than their non-AI peers and raise six times more in funding.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Latest reports reveal that the US government has signed a deal with Anthropic, a US-based AI startup backed by Amazon, for research, testing and evaluation of their artificial intelligence model. Under the terms of the deal, an institute associated with the government would receive access to the AI model before and after the public release. Anthropic is one of the leading developers of a large language model (LLM), the cutting edge tech that forms the basis for the popularity of ChatGPT by OpenAI.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the most followed stocks on Wall Street. Wells Fargo has an Overweight rating on the shares with a price target of $225. In a recent investor note, the advisory underlined that heavy upfront costs related to satellite launches, commencing in the second half of 2024, would reduce operating income forecasts for Amazon from 2025 through 2027, even as the launches present an attractive longer term opportunity.\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Brent Thill, Jefferies tech research analyst, recently said while talking to CNBC that we are seeing a rotation inside the tech industry where semiconductor and internet companies are performing well while software companies are underperforming.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Big Data Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other big data stocks.\nThe global big data market is on a rapid growth trajectory, projected to reach $103 billion by 2027, more than doubling its size from 2018. This explosive growth is driven by the increasing reliance on data to inform business decisions, optimize operations, and unlock new revenue streams. According to Statista, the software segment, in particular, is poised to dominate, accounting for 45% of the market by 2027. Big data, characterized by its massive volume, high velocity, and wide variety, presents both opportunities and challenges. Traditional data processing tools struggle to handle the scale and complexity of modern data sets, which have been expanding rapidly due to the surge in mobile data traffic, cloud computing, and the integration of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). These factors have contributed to the rise of big data as a critical asset for businesses across industries. As the data landscape evolves, advanced analytics tools such as predictive analytics and data mining have become essential for extracting valuable insights from vast datasets.\nThe rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a surge in connected devices, generating enormous amounts of data that necessitate advanced big data solutions for effective processing and analysis. Cloud computing enhances the big data market by offering scalable and cost-efficient storage and processing capabilities, enabling businesses to handle large data volumes with ease. Technological advancements in big data are continually enhancing the management and analysis of vast datasets, making these processes more accessible and practical. This progress supports the growing trend of data-driven decision-making, where companies increasingly rely on data insights to make informed choices, optimize operations, and secure a competitive edge. Additionally, big data analytics helps organizations uncover hidden patterns and customer trends, fostering innovation and allowing for the development of products and services that adapt to evolving market demands, underscoring the vital role of big data in today\u2019s competitive landscape.\nInvestment in big data technologies is also driven by stringent data privacy and security regulations. Compliance with laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S. is becoming mandatory for businesses. These regulations require robust data handling practices, pushing companies to implement advanced big data solutions that ensure data privacy and security. Enhanced measures such as secure storage and data privacy protocols build trust with consumers and stakeholders. Moreover, the need for effective data governance frameworks is accelerating the adoption of sophisticated big data technologies. These solutions facilitate comprehensive data management, including tracking data lineage, maintaining data integrity, and conducting regular audits. Emphasis is placed on integrating encryption, anonymization, and real-time monitoring tools to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. Continuous investment in big data technologies is crucial for businesses to meet evolving compliance requirements, thereby driving the market\u2019s growth.\nAccording to a report by Verified Market Reserach, North America is projected to remain a leader in the big data market, driven by key industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In the financial sector, Big Data analytics plays a crucial role for banks, investment firms, and insurance companies by providing deeper insights into customer behavior, detecting fraudulent activities, and evaluating risk. By analyzing extensive data sets, including transaction histories, market trends, and customer demographics, financial institutions can uncover patterns and anomalies that aid in making informed decisions and managing risks. Predictive analytics models further enhance market trend forecasts, optimize investment strategies, and improve portfolio management, contributing to greater profitability and competitive edge in the financial sector.\nIn healthcare, Big Data analytics significantly improves patient care, reduces costs, and advances medical research. Healthcare providers use Big Data to analyze electronic health records (EHRs), medical imaging, and genomic data to tailor treatment plans, diagnose diseases with greater precision, and predict patient outcomes. Population health analytics also helps healthcare organizations identify high-risk groups, allocate resources more effectively, and implement preventive measures. Additionally, the integration of big data into healthcare systems supports real-time monitoring of patient health metrics, allowing for timely interventions and better overall outcomes. Pharmaceutical companies benefit from big data by accelerating drug discovery, refining clinical trials, and creating personalized medicines, driving innovation and progress in medical science.\nWith such a robust outlook for the big data market, investors are keenly eyeing companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. In this article, we will explore the best big data stocks to buy now, focusing on companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on the immense growth opportunities within this dynamic sector.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Based on its dominance in multiple industry verticals, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) might be in a league of its own. Thanks to unbelievable growth and a share price that has skyrocketed 9,280% in the past 20 years, this giant tech enterprise currently carries a market cap of $1.75 trillion. That's higher than the gross domestic product (GDP) of all but 11 countries.\nMany investors probably wonder if adequate returns are still in the cards going forward. Is it too late to buy Amazon stock?\nSince Amazon raked in a whopping $604 billion in net sales in the past 12 months, you might question how much more growth this business can achieve as we look to the future. After all, it becomes more and more difficult to increase revenue on an already massive sales base.\nAccording to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Amazon is projected to increase revenue at a compound annual rate of 10.8% between 2023 and 2026. It's always a smart idea to take these forecasts with a grain of salt, but this is an encouraging outlook, no doubt.\nIt's not hard to believe that meaningful growth will continue. Amazon has numerous secular tailwinds that are helping propel it forward.\nThe first trend is the rise of online shopping, an area Amazon truly dominates. According to Statista, 38% of all e-commerce spending in the U.S. happens on Amazon.com. And given that 84% of retail spending in the U.S. still happens in person, Amazon should see steady growth for a long time.\nWith Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's leading cloud computing platform that commands 31% of global market share, Amazon benefits from the shift in IT spending from on-site to off-premises. This industry is also slated to register tremendous growth. Coupled with Amazon's immense artificial intelligence (AI)-related investments meant to bolster AWS, this segment is poised for outsized success.\nInvestors can't ignore the changing media landscape. The internet has paved the way for streaming entertainment to take over, and Amazon Prime Video is a leading service. According to Nielsen data, it's only behind Alphabet's YouTube and Netflix in terms of daily TV viewing time in the U.S.\nAn under-the-radar, but booming, area of Amazon is digital advertising, which saw revenue soar 20% in the latest quarter to $12.8 billion. Thanks to billions of motivated buyers visiting Amazon.com monthly, the business can display valuable ads.\nThese powerful secular trends still have long expansion runways over the next decade and beyond. Amazon is positioned to take advantage of them all.\nFrom the start of 2024 to July 2, the date Amazon's stock hit a peak, shares were up 32%. But it's been a different story since then. The stock currently trades 17% off its all-time high.\nThe setup for prospective investors is quite favorable. Shares go for a price-to-sales ratio of 2.9. This represents a discount to the trailing five- and 10-year average valuation multiples.\nBesides the potential for strong revenue growth, Amazon is also poised to see huge profit increases. Management has focused intensely on cutting costs, and so far, it's working. The company generated $14.7 billion of operating income in the second quarter, up 91% year over year.\nBetween 2023 and 2026, consensus analyst estimates call for earnings per share to rise at a compound annual rate of 36.8%. This means it's not too late to buy shares. In fact, there is still potential to earn adequate returns from owning Amazon.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) recent performance, when its stock has declined 2.1% over the past month. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Amazon.com's  ROE today.\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n Check out our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n19% = US$44b \u00f7 US$236b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.19.\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\nTo begin with, Amazon.com seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 21%. This probably goes some way in explaining Amazon.com's moderate 14% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.\nWe then performed a comparison between Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 14% in the same 5-year period.\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for AMZN? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. \nAmazon.com doesn't pay any regular dividends, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Amazon.com's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, the latest analyst forecasts show that the company will continue to see an expansion in its earnings. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe AI industry has been experiencing explosive growth, making it a highly attractive sector for potential investors. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the global generative AI market was valued at approximately $40 billion in 2022, just before the launch of ChatGPT, and is now expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of more than 40% to reach over $1.3 trillion in size within the next decade. This growth is fueled by the rapid adoption of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing, where AI is being leveraged to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and create new revenue streams. For instance, in healthcare, AI-driven diagnostics and personalized medicine are revolutionizing patient care, leading to more accurate and timely treatments. The finance sector is also reaping the benefits of AI through advanced algorithms for fraud detection, risk management, and personalized banking services.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThe AI market is not just expanding in terms of applications but also geographically. North America has been a dominant force in AI development, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon leading the charge. However, Asia-Pacific, particularly China, is rapidly catching up, driven by significant investments and a robust government push toward AI adoption. The Chinese government has an ambitious AI plan aimed to make the country a global leader in AI by 2030, with projections that the AI industry of China could reach $150 billion in size by then. This geographical diversification is crucial for investors looking to tap into different markets and reduce their risk exposure.\nInvestors should also consider the substantial investments being made in AI startups, which are critical drivers of innovation. According to CB Insights, AI startups raised over $66 billion in funding in 2022, marking a record year despite broader economic uncertainties. This trend is expected to continue as more venture capital firms and corporate investors recognize the potential of AI to disrupt traditional industries. Furthermore, the integration of AI with other emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and quantum computing, is likely to create new opportunities and markets, further driving growth.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Latest reports indicate that the company has signed a deal to purchase Perceive Corporation from California-based technology firm Xperi. Perceive is the developer of Ergo, an AI processor that focuses on delivering edge inference solutions. The move is part of a wider plan by Amazon to invest in AI chips, like competitors Google and Apple. The deal is worth around $80 million and includes specific clauses that prevent Xperi and Perceive from engaging in certain business activities for three years after the purchase. Under the terms of the deal, employees from the newly purchased firm would join the ecommerce giant after the sale goes through.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) might be a bit behind other tech giants when it comes to incorporating AI into products, but Wall Street still considers it a top idea in the growth space. For example, investment advisory Seaport Research has a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $200. In a recent investor note, the advisory underlined that while second quarter results and guidance were somewhat mixed for the company, the steady ecommerce growth, cloud leadership and advertising momentum were driving optimism around the shares.\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  James Brumley, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "You already know that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the stock market's most rewarding tickers this century. Although shares stumbled a bit during the dot-com meltdown following its 1997 initial public offering (IPO), they're now up more than 220,000% from their IPO price.\nBut how many shares would you own today if you had purchased only one share then? After all, it's split several times since the company's May 1997 public offering.\nAmazon stock has undergone four stock splits since its IPO, for the record. The first of these was a 2-for-1 split in June of 1998. The next one -- a 3-for-1 split -- took shape less than a year later. The stock split yet again on a 2-for-1 basis in the latter half of 1999.\nThen, the company held off on stock splits for quite some time, choosing to let shares appreciate in step with Amazon's growth.\nHowever, once its price moved and stayed well above $3,000 beginning in late 2020,\u00a0the company couldn't hold out any longer. In an effort to make it more accessible to more investors, Amazon stock underwent a 20-for-1 split in June of 2022.\nAll told, one share of Amazon purchased right at its IPO would be 240 shares today. On a split-adjusted basis, its IPO price of $18.00 per share has been pared down to only $0.075. As of the most recent look, the stock's still trading at over $166 per share, for perspective.\nOf course, few investors were wise enough to step into this then-risky e-commerce outfit right at its IPO and then stick with it this whole time.\nA few folks have done so, however, testifying to the power of being patient with a position in a young company with lots of potential. There will be other Amazon-like growth companies in the future.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks under hedge funds' radar.\nIt is no surprise that companies in the United States and China are leading the rest of the world when it comes to artificial intelligence. Conservative estimates about the impact of AI on the global economy, made by market experts at professional services firm PwC, reveal that AI-related gains, equal to close to $11 trillion, will account for nearly 70% of total global economic impact by 2030. In China, AI is expected to contribute to a nearly 26% boost to the GDP within the next six years, while this figure in the US will likely be 15%. AI no doubt represents the biggest commercial investment opportunity in this fast-paced world economy.\nSmart companies are seizing on this opportunity. According to market research firm IDC, investments in AI infrastructure will cross $30 billion this year and are projected to grow to $47 billion by 2028. This represents approximately 30% of the total global spending in AI. One of the most prominent AI use cases is in the customer service world. In this area, global businesses have spent more than $16 billion in 2024 so far. The impact of these investments in AI will be significant down the road. AI is likely to contribute to a $15 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030, up 14% from current levels.\nLike other sectors of the economy, Wall Street is no stranger to AI. The debut of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked the beginning of the AI revolution in the world of finance. Since then, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), sales of software, hardware, and services for AI systems have climbed rapidly and will top $400 billion in 2027. Financial sector spending is likely to double to nearly $100 billion in 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 30% \u2014 the fastest of five major industries. Hedge funds, often the pioneers of cutting-edge technology, are embracing generative AI as well.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. As it prepares to integrate AI into Amazon Web Services (AWS), one of the biggest cloud computing operations in the world, the tech firm has continued to invest in other AI ventures, most notably the $4 billion investment in California-based startup Anthropic earlier this year. The latter is a rival of OpenAI of ChatGPT fame. Under the terms of the agreement, the startup will use AWS as the primary cloud provider as it uses Amazon chips to build, train, and deploy generative AI models. Authorities in the United Kingdom are reviewing this deal to determine if it violates business competition rules.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been a Wall Street darling for many years. The past few weeks are no exception. Citigroup recently reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $245, noting that the firm delivered a strong second quarter as AWS revenue growth was accelerating, faster shipping times were improving conversion rates, and overall cost-to-serve costs were declining. The advisory further added that as the company incorporated AI across services, it was on track to deliver continued growth and margin expansion such that the third quarter operating income guide could prove conservative.\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Affan Mir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other consumer discretionary stocks.\nMany experts and analysts are concerned about a slowdown in consumer spending. However, reports show that consumer behavior is changing rather than slowing down. According to a report by Colliers Retail Market Intelligence, retail foot traffic rose by 4.4% in June, indicating strong consumer activity despite flat overall sales.\nWhile furniture and home improvement stores saw declines due to reduced monumental purchases and a sluggish housing market, grocery stores, and apparel retailers performed better. Grocery sales grew by 1.7%, with a nearly 5% increase in foot traffic, as consumers managed their budgets despite cutting costs. Apparel sales also increased by 3.8%, driven by early back-to-school shopping and wardrobe updates, leading to an 8.3% rise in foot traffic.\nIn July, consumer spending saw a modest increase compared to June, with gains across 10 of 12 retail categories, as reported by the CNBC/National Retail Federation (NRF) Retail Monitor. Retail sales, excluding autos and gas, rose by 0.7% month-over-month, slightly up from June's 0.5%, but the year-over-year growth slowed to 0.9%, down from 3.4% in June.\nCore retail, which excludes restaurants, saw a 1% monthly increase. Significant sector performances included a 3.4% rise in gas station sales and a 2.1% increase in restaurant spending month-over-month. Conversely, the healthcare, personal care, and garden supplies sectors experienced slight declines.\nJune and July data together indicate that consumer spending remains resilient, supported by strong household finances and a strong job market. While some sectors, particularly furniture and home improvement, are struggling due to reduced consumer confidence and a slow housing market, other categories are performing well.\nThe data suggests that consumers are still willing to spend, especially on essential and seasonal items, though they may be more cautious with larger purchases. Despite some areas of decline, the overall retail environment appears stable, with consumers continuing to spend where they find value, which indicates a cautiously optimistic outlook for the remainder of 2024.\nIn the July meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the Fed's ongoing focus on achieving maximum employment and stable prices. He noted significant progress in the economy, with inflation dropping from 7% to 2.5% and a balanced labor market with low unemployment at 4.1%. The Fed chose to keep interest rates steady within the 5.25% to 5.5% range and continue to reduce its securities holdings to maintain a restrictive stance, which is aimed at aligning demand with supply and reducing inflationary pressures.\nPowell mentioned that while inflation has eased, the Fed is not yet ready to lower rates and requires more consistent positive data before making such a move, possibly as early as September. According to the CME Fed Watch Tool, all the experts are expecting cuts in September. 50.5% of the experts predict a 25 basis points (bps) reduction in the interest rates while 49.5% expect a 50 bps cut.\nRate cuts generally have a positive effect on consumer spending. When interest rates are lowered, borrowing becomes cheaper, which could lead to increased consumer borrowing and spending. This increased affordability can boost consumer confidence and promote spending on discretionary items. That's a good set up for discretionary stocks, and with that, let's look at the 10 best consumer discretionary stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify over 50 large-cap consumer discretionary stocks then narrowed our list to 10 stocks that were most widely held by institutional investors as of Q1, and listed the stocks in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

In the second quarter, the company reported a 10% increase in consolidated revenue compared to the previous year, driven by growth across all its business segments.\nThe key driver of its profitability is Amazon Web Services (AWS), which leads the global cloud infrastructure market with a 32% share, according to Solganick, an independent investment banking and M&A advisory firm.

        "Title": "Amazon Offers Attractive Growth at a Reasonable Price",
        "Author": "  Blue Chip Portfolios ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has delivered exceptional results for long-term shareholders. The stock delivered a total return of roughly 993% over the past 10 years, while the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of roughly 231% over the same period. However, the e-commerce giant's shares have underperformed the benchmark index over the past five years, delivering a total return of roughly 84% while the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of around 97%.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nThe stock has underperformed as the company has continued to prioritize deploying capital into long-term growth opportunities as opposed to focusing on returning capital to shareholders. Moreover, it has encountered challenges related to increasing competition in both its online retail and Amazon Web Services business segments. China-based Temu and Shein have emerged as key competitors in the online retail business, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google have strengthened their cloud offerings to become more competitive with AWS.\nDespite these challenges, Amazon has continued to deliver solid growth and margin improvement. While the stock trades at an above-market forward price-earnings ratio of 35 based on consensus full-year 2024 earnings, I believe the stock is undervalued given the company's significant earnings growth potential.\nWith a market cap nearly $ 2 trillion, Amazon is currently the fifth-largest company by market cap in the U.S., trailing only Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Alphabet.\nIn terms of revenue for U.S.-based companies, Amazon's nearly $600 billion in annual revenue for 2023 trails only Walmart (NYSE:WMT). However, despite the company's massive size, it remains a growth story. In particular, the company has substantial earnings growth potential as margins are likely to significantly improve as its business mix continues to shift toward AWS.\nAs of the second quarter, AWS accounted for roughly 18% of total sales and 64% of operating profit. This is due to the fact that AWS, which has operating margins of about 35%, is a much higher-margin business than the retail division. During the second quarter, AWS sales increased 19% on a year-over-year basis, while the company's North America and International segments' sales increased by 9% and 7%. Thus, over time Amazon is likely to experience significant margin expansion simply due to a more favorable business mix. While the AWS business is already generating more than $100 billion in annual revenue, it has a very long runway as an estimated 85% of global IT spending remains on-premises. Furthermore, artificial intelligence has emerged as a key tailwind for the cloud business and revenue growth has started to accelerate. On the second-quarter call, CEO Andy Jassy discussed the impact the company is already starting to see from AI:\n\"Our AI business continues to grow dramatically with a multi-billion dollar revenue run rate despite it being such early days, but we can see in our results and conversations with customers that our unique approach and offerings are resonating with customers.\"\nAnother key element to Amazon's growth story is its advertising business. Advertising revenue for 2023 came in at around $47 billion, up from $12.50 billion in 2019. During the second quarter of 2024, advertising revenue increased 20% on a year-over-year basis and accounted for approximately $12.80 billion in total revenue.\nThe company lumps advertising revenue into its North America and International segments. However, to get a sense of how important advertising revenue is to these segments, it is important to note that quarterly advertising revenue of $12.80 billion significantly exceeded total operating profit of $5.30 billion for Amazon's North America and International segments combined.\nWhile Amazon does not provide an operating margin breakout for its advertising business, it is safe to say this is a very high-margin business as competitors such as Google and Meta (NASDAQ:META) have operating margins of around 30% and 38% respectively. As advertising revenue growth continues to outpace growth in Amazon's retail business, I expect further margin expansion in both the North America and International business segments.\nFinally, other key drivers for Amazon include continued international expansion and margin improvement in its core retail business. Currently, the company derives nearly 70% of total revenue from the U.S., which suggests it has a significant international growth runway. Additionally, Amazon likely has significant margin expansion opportunity in its core retail business as much of the operating profit in both the North American and International segments is currently coming from advertising, suggesting there is significant room for margin expansion in the core business over time as sales grow while much of the fixed investment needed to support the business has already been made.\nAmazon currently trades near 35 times 2024 consensus earnings per share and 29 times fiscal 2025 consensus earnings per share. Comparably, the S&P 500 is trading at 22.20 times 2024 consensus earnings. While Amazon is trading at a significant premium to the broader market, the company has much better growth prospects.\nCurrently, consensus estimates call for Amazon to report earnings per share growth of 62% for 2024, 24% for 2025, 29% for 2026 and 20% for 2027. Comparably, the S&P 500 is expected to grow 2024 and 2025 earnings by 11% and 14.70%. Moreover, in addition to growing earnings rapidly over the next few years, Amazon also has strong long-term growth potential due to increasing global adoption of cloud computing, a secular shift toward online retail and international expansion opportunities.\nThus, on a relative basis, I view Amazon as a more attractive investment than the broader market as I believe the stock is likely to be driven higher by strong earnings growth. Moreover, the stock is attractive relative to its own historical valuation norms. Despite a number of recent positive developments, including accelerating AWS growth and overall margin improvement for the company, the stock is trading toward the low end of its recent historical valuation range based on both a price-earnings ratio and price-to-cash from operations basis.\nIn my view, the key risk to the Amazon bull case is regulatory risk. In September 2023, the U.S. government and 17 states filed a landmark lawsuit claiming that Amazon is an illegal monopoly. The company tried to get the case dismissed, but a U.S. judge recently set a trial date for October 2026. While the outcome is uncertain, I do not believe the government is likely to succeed as Amazon faces significant competition across all of its key businesses. The AWS business competes with stalwarts such as Microsoft and Google, while the company's retail business competes with players such as Walmart, Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Target (NYSE:TGT), Temu, Shein and many others.\nAnother key risk is increasing competition. In particular, the threat posed to AWS by Microsoft's Azure is something that Amazon bulls should monitor closely. While Azure has been gaining market share, AWS market share losses appear limited as it is estimated to have 31% market share, down from 32% a year ago. Azure's market share is estimated to have grown to roughly 26%, up from an estimated 14% in 2017. Thus, Azure appears to be gaining market share from smaller players, which suggests AWS remains a highly competitive offering. I would view any significant decline in AWS market share along with slowing revenue growth to be a cause for concern. However, this is not currently the case as AWS market share appears stable and revenue growth is accelerating.\nAnother competitive threat which has weighted on Amazon shares is the rise of Temu and Shien, which offer lower prices in exchange for longer delivery times. In response, Amazon recently announced plans to launch a new discount service which will offer goods directly from China warehouses. Overall, I view the threat from Temu and Shien as only a marginal concern given Amazon's massive scale advantage.\nAmazon shares have delivered exceptional results for long-term shareholders. However, the stock has underperformed the broader market over the past five years. Despite its massive size, the company is likely to grow earnings per share at a rate well above the broader market over the next few years.\nDespite the company's strong near-term and long-term growth prospects, driven by increased demand for cloud computing and growing advertising revenue, the stock trades at just 29 times full-year 2025 earnings.\nI believe the stock is attractively valued at current levels and represents a solid growth at a reasonable price investment opportunity.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Technology Stocks to Buy for Long Term.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other technology stocks.\nThe technology industry is one of the key drivers of the global economy. According to MGI research, the global technology industry was valued at $8.51 trillion in 2022 and is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.75% to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. In the United States alone the information technology industry drives more than one-third of the national economy.\nOne of the latest trends in the tech industry has been the increasing investments in artificial intelligence by both tech giants and start-up companies. According to a July 3 report by Reuters, the US venture capital funding surged to $55.6 billion during the second quarter of 2024. The funding surged more than 47% on a quarterly basis and was mainly driven by significant investments in artificial intelligence companies including $6 billion raised by Elon Musk\u2019s xAI.\nHowever, over the past few months, the technology sector has seen a major sell-off due to what analysts call an \u201cAI bubble\u201d. The sell-off initiated with investors raising concerns over return on investment regarding the premium they have been paying as capital expenditure on artificial intelligence. On August 5, CNBC reported that the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d US tech companies lost a combined $1 trillion market value at the start of the trading day. As a result, NASDAQ was down 3%, marking the index\u2019s steepest three-week slide in two years.\nWe recently covered the AI tech bubble in detail in 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst. Here\u2019s a glimpse of the article:\n\u201cIn the past few weeks, a major selloff in the technology sector, mostly over concerns about return on investments amid ballooning capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), has hit the stock market, sending valuations crashing and igniting fears of an AI bubble at the marketplace that might be about to burst. However, Stacy Rasgon, who has covered semiconductor stocks, one of the most prominent sectors in the AI world, for over fifteen years, has advised investors to stay the course, terming fears of a bubble as overblown. Rasgon claims that even though chances of an air pocket, used to refer to stock plunges, are 100%, he is confident the time for them is not now. He pointed to the very real and massive AI data center build as an example, predicting it would go on for a few years, helping push AI stocks higher.\u201d\nMichael Landsberg, Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth CIO appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the AI bubble. He believes that the AI bubble hasn\u2019t popped yet and what we saw recently was a reset of the market, where the market resets out-of-sync factors, and does not mean that the analysts are not positive about AI. He further added that a lot of AI companies have had a great past six months and are growing their earnings. He believes that ultimately earnings drive any stock and as far as AI stocks are concerned their earnings are growing and will continue to grow, thereby increasing the price.\nMoreover, Steve Eisman, Neuberger Berman Senior Portfolio Manager appeared on another CNBC interview termed the recent events as a \u201cPsychological Rotation\u201d. He mentioned that this was not a fundamental rotation, which could have been troublesome, rather it is a psychological rotation that will not hold for long. He further mentioned that Artificial intelligence is here to stay for years and he still sees massive growth opportunities for companies investing in AI.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of 10 best technology stocks to buy for the long term we used the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners. We searched for technology stocks and sorted them based on their market capitalization. From these stocks, we selected technology stocks that have been in business for 20 years or more and are expected to stay in business for several decades. Once we had the consolidated list, we ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\u00a0\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) started as an online bookstore. Today it has grown to become a $1.85 trillion company and is recognized as one of the largest online retailers, has operations in cloud computing, and digital streaming, and is also investing heavily in artificial intelligence.\nAMZN is the best technology stock to buy for the long term, we say this because it was held by 308 hedge funds in Q2 2024, with total stakes worth $65.85 billion. Fisher Asset Management is the top shareholder of the company, with a position worth $8.46 billion.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported a significant increase in revenue and operating income during its latest quarter. Its top line reached $148 billion after increasing 11% year-over-year. Revenue growth was driven by a strong performance in its AWS division, which grew 18.8% to reach $26.3 billion.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) enjoys the benefit of repeat spending from its subscription-based services, thereby providing it with significant operating income. During Q2 2024, its operating income soared 91% year-over-year to reach 14.7 billion, out of which $9.3 billion came from its AWS operations.\nThe stock did take a hit with the market indexes falling in 2022, however, since then it has continued to improve and the stock hit all-time highs this year. Management\u2019s effort to significantly improve inventory management has resulted in the company making record-free cash flow. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) free cash flow was up 572% year-over-year and was recorded to be more than $52.9 billion during the quarter. This strong cash generation can be profitable for both the company as it can invest in its AI development and for investors as they will get increased returns.\nOver the past decade, the company has grown its revenue and net income by 22% and 73% indicating robust financials and long term growth opportunities from its recurring revenues.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best technology stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe AI industry continues to be highly dynamic, with significant growth anticipated across various sectors in 2024. The expansion of generative AI, which saw exponential growth in 2023, is expected to continue this year, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value as businesses move from pilot projects to broader implementation. This shift suggests that 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI as companies aim to leverage capabilities more fully to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate across different industries. The market for generative AI is forecasted to grow rapidly, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 60%, reaching a valuation of around $37 billion by 2028. This growth is fueled by the widespread adoption of AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThe AI revolution is already transforming operations across the world by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and enhancing predictive capabilities. The healthcare sector, for example, is poised for substantial advancements due to AI, with the market expected to grow to around $188 billion by 2030, driven by innovations in genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. Edge computing is another area likely to see significant development in 2024, as it becomes increasingly critical for enabling AI applications that require real-time data processing. The move towards edge computing, where data is processed closer to the source, is expected to reduce latency and improve the performance of AI systems, particularly in sectors like autonomous vehicles, IoT, and industrial automation.\nThis trend underscores the growing importance of a robust semiconductor supply chain, especially as global trade tensions and geopolitical events continue to impact the availability of critical components like chips. Experts also emphasize the growing importance of ethical considerations and responsible AI. As AI technologies become more deeply embedded in various aspects of society, concerns around privacy, bias, and security are likely to intensify, prompting calls for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. The rapid growth will also bring challenges related to talent acquisition, supply chain management, and the need for responsible AI practices. As such, the industry is likely to be marked by both tremendous opportunities and complex challenges in the near term.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

        "Text": "It might be hard to imagine, but Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) began only 30 years ago as an online bookseller. Now the site sells a wide range of goods. The business has grown quickly and includes the popular Amazon Prime subscription service, electronic devices, and Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nThe shares have also generated a lot of wealth for investors. Investors who bought shares a decade ago, and held them, would have seen an increase of almost 1,000%.\nAmazon had its initial public offering (IPO) in 1997, when its sales were about $148 million for the year. The figure grew to nearly $575 billion last year.\nBut you didn't have to buy the shares at the IPO price to make a lot of money. Over the last decade, Amazon's shares have appreciated 945%. That easily bested the S&P 500's 227% total return.\nEven starting with a relatively small $1,000 just 10 years ago, you would now have about $10,500. Placing the same amount in the S&P 500 would've resulted in about $3,300.\nAmazon's stock will likely have a hard time reproducing those kinds of returns over the next 10 years, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth buying.\nAmazon shares have a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 39, much higher than the S&P 500's 27 multiple. That suggests the market has high expectations for Amazon's growth.\nCloud computing business AWS remains the company's main profit generator. The unit's sales grew 18.6% to $26.3 billion in the most recent quarter, and operating income went from $5.4 billion to $9.3 billion. It also has the highest operating margin, 36.5%, among the company's three segments. Prospects look good given business's demand for data, and the artificial intelligence push could give the business a further boost.\nHowever, with the relatively high valuation, you may want to employ dollar-cost averaging to purchase shares over time. That way, you invest small sums at regular intervals, and you won't have to worry about timing the market.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon's robust financial performance showcases significant growth in net income and comprehensive income.\nTechnological advancements and international expansion present both opportunities and challenges.\nLegal proceedings and intense competition underline potential threats to Amazon's market position.\nAmazon's commitment to innovation and customer service remains a key strength.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), the global e-commerce and cloud computing giant, released its 10-Q filing on August 2, 2024, revealing a comprehensive view of its financial health and strategic positioning. The filing indicates a robust financial performance, with net income nearly doubling from $6,750 million in Q2 2023 to $13,485 million in Q2 2024. This growth is also reflected in the six-month comparison, with net income rising from $9,922 million to $23,916 million. Comprehensive income followed a similar trend, although it faced a slight decrease in other comprehensive income due to foreign currency translation adjustments. These financials set the stage for a detailed SWOT analysis, providing investors with insights into Amazon's strategic direction and market dynamics.\nFinancial Resilience and Market Leadership: Amazon's financial performance is a testament to its resilience and market leadership. The company's net income surge from $6,750 million to $13,485 million in the second quarter of 2024, coupled with a comprehensive income increase to $22,963 million for the first half of the year, underscores its strong profitability and operational efficiency. This financial strength enables Amazon to invest in new technologies, market expansion, and customer service enhancements, further solidifying its position as a leading online retailer and cloud service provider.\nInnovative Technology and Infrastructure: Amazon's commitment to innovation is evident in its technology and infrastructure investments. The company's focus on research and development has led to the creation of cutting-edge products and services, such as AWS, which continues to dominate the cloud computing space. Amazon's technological advancements not only drive internal efficiencies but also provide a competitive edge in attracting and retaining customers through improved offerings and user experiences.\nDependency on Third-Party Sellers: While Amazon's marketplace model has been a significant growth driver, it also presents a weakness. The reliance on third-party sellers exposes the company to risks associated with seller misconduct, such as counterfeit goods and fraudulent activities. These issues can damage Amazon's reputation and lead to legal challenges, as indicated by the various legal proceedings mentioned in the filing. Managing this dependency and ensuring a trustworthy platform is crucial for maintaining customer confidence and brand integrity.\nInternational Expansion Challenges: Amazon's aggressive international expansion strategy, while a source of growth, also introduces complexities and risks. The company faces intense competition, regulatory hurdles, and cultural differences in new markets, which can hinder profitability and operational effectiveness. As Amazon continues to navigate these challenges, it must adapt its business model to local market conditions and regulatory environments to ensure sustained success abroad.\nGlobal Market Penetration: Amazon's international sales, which constitute a significant portion of its revenue, present an opportunity for further market penetration. By leveraging its brand and technological prowess, Amazon can expand its presence in emerging markets, where e-commerce adoption is still growing. Tailoring its offerings to local preferences and investing in regional infrastructure can drive increased market share and revenue growth in these high-potential areas.\nTechnological Advancements: The continuous evolution of technology offers Amazon opportunities to enhance its service offerings and customer experience. Innovations in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and logistics can improve operational efficiencies, reduce costs, and create new revenue streams. By staying at the forefront of technological advancements, Amazon can maintain its competitive advantage and attract a broader customer base.\nIntense Competition: Amazon operates in highly competitive markets, facing rivals with substantial resources and established market positions. As competitors innovate and adapt, Amazon must continuously invest in its platform, technology, and marketing to retain its market share. The intense competition also puts pressure on pricing and margins, which can impact Amazon's profitability and growth prospects.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks: Amazon's diverse operations expose it to various regulatory and legal risks. The filing highlights ongoing legal proceedings that could result in significant financial penalties and reputational harm. Additionally, changes in tax laws, data privacy regulations, and antitrust scrutiny can affect Amazon's business practices and financial performance. Proactively managing these risks and engaging with policymakers is essential for Amazon's long-term success.\nIn conclusion, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) demonstrates a strong financial foundation and a commitment to innovation that positions it well for future growth. However, the company must navigate the complexities of international expansion, manage its reliance on third-party sellers, and address the competitive and regulatory landscape. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, Amazon can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats, ensuring its continued leadership in the e-commerce and cloud computing sectors.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$200 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$168. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Amazon.com's current trading price of US$168 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Amazon.com\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n Check out our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nAccording to our price multiple model, where we compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. We\u2019ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there\u2019s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock\u2019s ratio of 39.65x is currently well-above the industry average of 16.19x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Amazon.com\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 99% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Amazon.com. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? AMZN\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question \u2013 should I sell? If you believe AMZN should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on AMZN for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for AMZN, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nIn light of this, if you'd like to do more analysis on the company, it's vital to be informed of the risks involved.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nIn recent months, the AI industry has been presenting explosive opportunities in the development and deployment of AI infrastructure. Companies that provide AI chips, cloud services, and data storage solutions are poised to benefit from the growing demand for AI capabilities. For example, NVIDIA, a leading provider of AI chips, has seen the shares rally by 160% in 2024, driven by the increasing need for powerful processing capabilities in AI applications. Similarly, cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are seeing a surge in demand for their AI and machine learning services, making them attractive options for investors.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nHowever, in this buzz around the new tech, investors should also stop and consider some of the risks and challenges associated with AI. Regulatory scrutiny on AI firms is intensifying, particularly around issues of data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the ethical use of AI. Governments worldwide are beginning to implement regulations that could impact how AI technologies are developed and deployed. For instance, the European Union has proposed an AI Act that seeks to create a regulatory framework that addresses the risks associated with AI while promoting innovation. This regulatory environment could lead to increased compliance costs and slower adoption rates in certain sectors, posing a potential risk for investors.\nAnother critical consideration for investors is the talent shortage in the AI industry. The demand for skilled AI professionals far outstrips supply, leading to fierce competition among companies for top talent. This talent gap could slow down the development and deployment of AI technologies, particularly in smaller companies that may not have the resources to compete with tech giants like Google and Microsoft for talent. Despite these challenges, the overall outlook for the AI industry remains highly positive.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Investor concerns around the stock have been mounting in the past few weeks, mainly due to weaker-than-expected revenue growth projections and continued high spending, mostly on AI and cloud infrastructure. The forward guidance on revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates in the latest quarter despite a 12% rise in total sales and higher-than-expected profits for the second quarter. This has led to concerns about slower growth in the coming quarters. The significant capital expenditures, in part on the development of AI capabilities, have also raised worries about the impact on short-term profitability.\nPerhaps these are some of the reasons why Wells Fargo recently lowered the price target on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock to $225 from $232 and kept an Overweight rating. In an investor note, the advisory noted that heavy upfront costs related to satellite launches, commencing in the second half of 2024, reduce operating income forecasts for Amazon from 2025 through 2027. The note further detailed that Kuiper presented an attractive opportunity longer term for Amazon, but also unclear synergy with core operations.\nOverall, AMZN ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Jeannine Mancini ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) just hit its 30th anniversary, a huge milestone for a company that started as an online bookstore and became a global tech giant. Jeff Bezos's belief that most big companies only last around 30 years makes this anniversary even more interesting.\nDon't Miss:\nHere\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\nThis startup\u2019s stem cell research aims to reduce reliance on animal testing \u2014 Sees 55% uptick in YTD sales and only costs $3 per share for early investors.\nBack in 2018, during a company meeting, Bezos reportedly mentioned, \"If you look at large companies, their life spans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years.\" In that same meeting, he said, \"I predict one day Amazon will fail. Amazon will go bankrupt.\"\nSee Also: Don\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\nBezos, who founded Amazon in 1994, has often discussed how businesses have a natural life cycle. He's pointed out that as companies grow, they face big challenges \u2013 like market changes and new technology \u2013 that could eventually bring them down. But Bezos isn't just being negative. He's used this idea to shape Amazon's strategy and keep the company moving forward.\nTrending: Amid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nOne of the key ideas Bezos has championed at Amazon is his \"Day One\" mindset. This approach is all about staying nimble and keeping the energy of a startup, no matter how big Amazon gets. Bezos wrote in a 2017 letter to shareholders, \"Day Two is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by an excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day One.\"\nAs CEO, Bezos stressed the importance of being obsessed with customers and thinking long-term. His 2020 letter to shareholders said, \"If you want to be successful in business (in life, actually), you have to create more than you consume.\"\nTrending: Don\u2019t miss the real AI boom \u2013 here\u2019s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\nThe idea that big companies only last about 30 years isn't just an assumption Bezos made \u2013 it's backed up by data. For example, the average time a company stays in the S&P 500 index has dropped from 33 years in 1964 to just 24 years in 2016. This is mostly because of rapid technological changes and constantly emerging competitors.\nWhile many companies fail to survive past a few decades, some survive much longer. Hertz, for instance, was founded in 1918 and lasted over 100 years before it filed for bankruptcy in 2020. On the other hand, companies like Wells Fargo, Boeing, and Ford have been around for over a century, proving that while it's tough, it's not impossible to stick around.\nTrending: Can you guess which type of investments Morgan Stanley says will reach $2.7 trillion by 2027? It even offers up to 20% APY potential to accredited investors up to $300 back in bonus for new users.\nAs Amazon neared its 30-year mark, Bezos made headlines for selling many of his Amazon shares. In February 2024, he sold 50 million shares worth $8.5 billion, followed by another sale worth $5 billion in July 2024. These sales are part of Bezos's broader strategy to fund his other ventures, including space exploration through Blue Origin and various philanthropic efforts.\nOver the past three decades, Amazon's journey has been marked by big achievements and challenges. The company has grown into one of the world's largest retailers, with a market valuation exceeding $2 trillion. Its success can be attributed to Bezos's visionary leadership and his ability to anticipate market trends and adapt accordingly.\nRead Next:\nWhen today\u2019s AI startups go public, most of the rapid growth will be behind them \u2014 here\u2019s how not to get left out.\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAMAZON.COM (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Jeff Bezos Said 'I Predict One Day Amazon Will Fail' And Claims Large Companies Only Last '30-Plus Years' \u2013 Guess How Old Amazon Is? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Author": "  Bob Karr ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AdTech stocks.\nIt goes without saying that the advertisement technology industry happens to be an exciting and ever-evolving sector, as digital advertising continues to dominate the market trends and remains at the forefront when it comes to strategic marketing. According to industry data by Allied Market Research, the global AdTech market was pegged at $748.2 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $2.9 trillion by 2031. This demonstrates a CAGR of ~14.7% from 2022 to 2031.\nThis growth comes off the back of growing digital and internet penetration, increased usage of advanced technology like AI and machine learning, improved prospects for the gaming industry, and growth in social media apps including Facebook, WhatsApp, and others. Some of the top trends dominating the AdTech industry include higher usage of connected TV (CTV) advertising, in-app advertising, and interactive ads.\nThe AdTech market has been bifurcated into solution, advertising type, size of an enterprise, platform, etc. The AdTech industry includes a wide range of companies and products, such as demand-side platforms (DSPs), supply-side platforms (SSPs), ad exchanges, data management platforms (DMPs), and more. Experts are of the view that the global supply-side platform (SSP) market size should touch ~$117.32 billion by 2033. This means that the industry should compound at ~13.3% from 2023 to 2033. This growth is expected to stem from technological advancements, higher consumer demand, and supportive government policies.\nIn the same vein, the demand side platform software market size should touch US$120.1 billion by 2033 on the heels of an improved trend of programmatic advertising and, the need for better targeting along with measurement capabilities for online ads. While the AdTech industry seems promising, inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI) makes it even more appealing.\nGlobal AdTech industry continues to prepare for the complete deprecation of third-party cookies by Google, which makes up ~65% of the web browser market share. This transition seems to be a critical step for enabling user privacy and data security. Artificial Intelligence, because of its capability to process vast amounts of data, should play a crucial role.\nResearch suggests that ~54% of businesses believe that AI offers advertising cost savings and efficiencies and ~30% of marketing professionals decided to earmark more than 40% of their marketing budget to campaigns that are AI-executed. The advent of smart speakers, voice search, and podcasting can help advertisers in creating fresh avenues to connect with target audiences with the help of audio and voice technology.\nWhile advertisers can exploit the opportunities available in the AdTech industry, they need to be wary about challenges such as Ad fraud. These frauds are caused mainly because of bot traffic, domain spoofing, or ad stacking. Some other challenges include inventory quality, ad creativity, and brand safety.\nAI and ML are revolutionizing digital advertising by enabling advertisers to assess vast amounts of data in real time. As a result, the advertisers can make data-driven decisions for optimizing ad campaigns. Advertisers now use algorithmic advertising, personalization, and performance metrics to maximize ROI.\nAI algorithms help in automating media buying, making sure that ads reach the target audience. Personalized ads can be delivered using AI-powered recommendation engines and these engines enable real-time tracking, which can help make quick adjustments to fuel success.\nThe global AdTech industry is expected to compound in the mid-teens range over the next decade. Given that it's still early in its growth story, now is the time to look at some of the best AdTech stocks.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the holdings of SmartETFs Advertising & Marketing Technology ETF and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. For the purposes, we sifted through Insider Monkey\u2019s hedge fund data for 1Q 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading online retailer and one of the highest-grossing e-commerce aggregators. The company\u2019s focus areas include e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and AI.\nThe stock of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) came under pressure after the internet giant missed analysts\u2019 expectations on revenues. The company\u2019s revenues fell short by $760 million. This was mainly because of the subdued growth of North American and international retail segments. This slowness in growth offset the accelerating growth of its Amazon Web Services cloud platform.\nHowever, it seems that the knee-jerk reaction that broader markets saw has impacted the shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company has given a healthy outlook, with operating income expected to come in the range of $11.5 billion and $15 billion in 3Q 2024. Even at the mid-point,\u00a0the company should be able to see an 18% YoY improvement. This compares to the analysts\u2019 expectations of ~6.1% earnings growth in 3Q 2024 for S&P 500 companies.\nSecondly, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expected to benefit from the opportunities in cloud computing. The company\u2019s management is of the view that most of its customers have ended their cost management initiatives. These initiatives had earlier led to a slowdown in AWS sales growth. With these initiatives coming to an end, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s cutting-edge AI developments should help AWS grow its lead in cloud computing.\nThe company\u2019s CEO said that the generative AI boom has been prompting more companies to upgrade their cloud services. AWS tends to have much higher operating margins as compared to the company\u2019s e-commerce marketplaces.\nAnalysts at TD Securities increased their price objective on shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) from $225.00 to $245.00 on 10th July. A total of 302 hedge funds tracked by the Insider Monkey database held stakes in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), up from 293 in the preceding quarter.\nDiamond Hill Capital, an investment management company, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter and mentioned\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best AdTech stocks to buy. You can visit 8 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0to see the other AdTech stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering strong returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Institutions' substantial holdings in Amazon.com implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n47% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders\n 11% of Amazon.com is held by insiders\nA look at the shareholders of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 63% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nAnd last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$1.8t in market cap. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 33%.\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of Amazon.com, beginning with the chart below.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Amazon.com. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amazon.com's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Amazon.com. Our data suggests that Jeffrey Bezos, who is also the company's Top Key Executive, holds the most number of shares at 8.8%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock, investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.1% by the third-largest shareholder.\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Amazon.com, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$1.8t, and insiders have US$190b worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would be pleased to see the board is investing alongside them. You may wish to access this free chart showing recent trading by insiders.\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 27% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow, for free.\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.\nThe CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has \u201cchanged.\u201d\n\u201cFrom what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.\u201d\nIn this program, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies\u2019 fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Mizuho analyst James Lee reiterated his Outperform rating on the stock and gave a $240 price target. \u00a0The survey shows that spending on AWS is expected to rise about 22% year over year in 2024, up from the previous estimate of 20%, as generative AI projects are seen at an \u201cinflection point\u201d with external models about six months away from commercial deployment.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0doesn\u2019t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) operates the world\u2019s leading e-commerce marketplace and the largest public cloud platform and has a burgeoning advertising business. We expect to see sustained margin improvement as Amazon\u2019s retail regionalization efforts are bearing fruit and as its advertising business continues to scale ahead of peers. We believe the profitability ramp is still in the early innings as the company turns its attention to improving costs. One area will be inbound shipping, where faster delivery times through reduced freight, miles and packaging can reduce waste. We also see generative AI tailwinds and infrastructure modernization driving re-acceleration in growth at AWS, further enhancing Amazon\u2019s free cash flow compounding potential. In addition, following our early 2024 ESG engagements with Amazon (after multiyear engagements) we were positively inclined to see continued improvements in labor relations (health and safety metrics, benefits and wages), as well as in environmental stewardship (climate targets, reducing packaging materials, electric delivery trucks) and innovation (commitments to responsible AI and data privacy). One of the newly announced initiatives on the retail side is consolidating deliveries into fewer boxes, which reduces packaging.\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) is experimenting with removing customer ratings from its product search results page, a test that the retailer says could make it easier for shoppers to scan its vast selection of products.\nThe \"limited test\" affects only a small set of products, the company told Fortune on Thursday, and only affects the search results page, with star ratings and review count totals still available on individual product pages.\nSome Amazon customers and sellers recently noticed changes to the Amazon website and mobile app that strip away the star rating and review count of the products that appear in search results. In one example on LinkedIn, an Amazon seller posted the product listing results for a search for \"water flosser.\" Previously, the resulting feed of products in the search results would each include a line of information, from left to right, that included a numerical rating from 0 to 5, the same rating displayed in the form of five shaded-in stars, as well as the number of total ratings for a given product.\nIn the new experience, all of that rating and review information has been removed from the overall results page, and shoppers need to click through to each listing's product page to view this information.\nAmazon is known among its rivals as an online retailer that is constantly testing new features and tweaking formats inside its shopping experience. But the recent change to the search results page has drawn attention because of the impact it could have to shoppers, independent sellers, and big brands alike.\nAmazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti confirmed to Fortune that the change is indeed a test, rather than the result of a software bug. She did not offer any information about the results of the testing so far, or about how long the company plans to conduct the tests.\n\"We're conducting a limited test on a small set of products to refine which product information, including reviews and other attributes, show in search results to make the results more compact so customers can quickly and easily browse a range of product options.\"\nBoschetti also stressed that all of the product details, including ratings and reviews, will continue to show up on individual product pages.\nOn the surface, it's fair to wonder how much screen space and customer browsing time Amazon is actually saving by eliminating this one line of information. With customers increasingly using smartphones to browse and buy on the web, companies have optimized the mobile versions of their sites and apps for smaller screens.\nRatings and reviews have long served as one of Amazon's biggest differentiators and advantages, but also a source of exasperation. As Amazon has courted millions of merchants across to the globe to begin selling through its marketplace, some have tried to game the reviews system through tactics ranging from paying shoppers for 5-star reviews to merging a new product onto an existing product's listing so the new merchandise looks like its carrying a high rating.\nA few years back, Amazon introduced one-tap ratings that made it easier for \"verified buyers\" to provide feedback on a product without crafting a written review. At least part of the idea behind the initiative was that it might make it harder, or more expensive, for fake reviews to significantly impact a product's overall rating.\nMore recently, Amazon has added AI-powered review summaries to product pages to give shoppers a snapshot of customer feedback without having to wade through individual reviews.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0\u00a015 Best Stocks to Buy According to Hosking Partners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other best stocks to buy according to Hosking Partners.\nHosking Partners was established in 2013 by Jeremy Hosking as an independent partnership that offers a single global equity strategy. The firm appeals to investors seeking long-term returns and innovative thinking employing a capital cycle approach to investing. It has a diverse set of stocks in its portfolio that belong to a variety of industries consisting of AI, shipping, and financial services, among others. Jeremy Hosking earned an MA from the University of Cambridge, after which he served Marathon Asset Management 26 years as a founding partner and lead portfolio manager. There he contributed to developing the capital cycle approach to investment.\nIn its recent blog about shipping, Hosking Partners believes that understanding the cycles in different classes of shipping and global trends is essential for successful investment in the industry. Currently, Shipping (covering the container, dry bulk, product tanker and LNG sub-sectors) represents 1.25% of the portfolio. Global trade has declined as a percentage of GDP since 2010 caused by deglobalization, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical instability from the Russia-Ukraine war. This trend, coupled with the energy transition, is expected to constrain future supply and increase commodity price volatility, benefiting shipping by enabling cross-border trade.\nFurthermore, shipping is a significant emitter of CO2, accounting for about 3% of global emissions. Environmental regulations aim to reduce emissions, but uncertainty over future fuel technology deters investment in new ships, leading to a tighter supply. The industry\u2019s efficiency, measured by emissions per tonne-km, remains high compared to other transport modes. The shipping industry is at a pivotal juncture, with significant transformations driven by AI, the energy transition, and ESG considerations.\nAnother industry that Hosking Partners talks about is copper mining. Copper is often seen as a barometer for economic health and is crucial for the energy transition, including electric vehicles, power grids, and wind turbines. Wall Street banks are optimistic about copper prices, forecasting significant gains. Citi analysts suggest that prices could surge to over $15,000 per ton in the next 2-3 years if a strong economic recovery occurs, while their base case projects a rise to $12,000 per ton with modest demand growth through 2025 and 2026. Bank of America has also increased its 2024 copper price target to $9,321 from $8,625, citing tight mine supply and high demand driven by the energy transition as key factors.\nHowever, some experts are cautious. Colin Hamilton of BMO Capital Markets argues that commodity markets tend to self-correct, and if supply issues persist, demand may adjust, potentially leading to lower prices. Hamilton suggests that while high price targets might be temporarily achievable, adjustments in demand could follow. The market may see a modest surplus due to increased mined supply, which is projected to grow by 4-4.5%.\u00a0This is largely driven by new greenfield and brownfield projects. Despite the near-term surplus, long-term scarcity is anticipated as regulatory and political challenges in South America could impede the development of new mines.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Amazon\u2019s first-quarter revenue grew by 12.5% year-over-year, and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on Amazon with a price target of $240, following an analysis of the U.S. e-commerce market. The research indicates that Amazon is on track to surpass Walmart as the largest U.S. retailer by 2024, with long-term e-commerce penetration potentially exceeding 40%.\nThis stock is highly favored by customers due to its extensive diversification in AI and cloud computing, making its products and services top choices among cloud users. During Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q2 2024 earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the rapid growth of the company\u2019s AI business, driven by Amazon\u2019s belief that no single AI tool can dominate the market. As a result, Amazon offers a wide range of AI tools, ensuring that developers and consumers can find the best fit for their needs.\nThe company\u2019s impressive growth and rising investor interest are also fueled by the profitability of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. The increasing demand for AWS, particularly due to Amazon\u2019s investments in generative AI projects, led to an 18.8% year-over-year increase in AWS revenue in the second quarter.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc.

        "Title": "Prediction: This Will Be Amazon Stock's Next Move",
        "Author": "  Jon Quast, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Predicting the movements of any particular stock is challenging, but historically it's been easier with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock. A pattern emerged years ago showing a strong correlation between Amazon's price per share and its operating profit.\nIt might seem like calculating a business' profits is a straightforward process. But in reality, there are multiple ways of looking at things. There are widely used accounting methods that take everything into account. But some businesses make long-term strategical moves that reduce accounting profits right now. Adjusting for these kind of things can paint a more accurate picture of the company. This is why multiple profit metrics are relevant to investors.\nFor Amazon, the operating profit metric looks at what the business is earning before factoring in other things such as interest expenses and taxes. Over the last decade, when operating profit rises, Amazon stock goes up most of the time, and vice versa, as the chart below shows.\nIn recent weeks, Amazon stock has plunged about 20%, and I'm sure that investors want to know what will happen next. Well, I'd say the next big move for Amazon stock will be predicted by forecasting the next big move for its operating income. And here's what we can know about that right now.\nIn the first half of 2024, Amazon had operating income of nearly $30 billion. This is an incredible 141% increase from the same period of 2023. And it's worth noting that operating income over the last 12 months is at an all-time high.\nAs has long been the case, most of Amazon's operating profit comes from Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the second quarter of 2024, AWS had an operating profit of $10.5 billion, which was 84% of the company's total Q2 operating profit. Therefore, it stands to reason that if an investor can predict what will happen with Amazon's AWS, they can predict what will happen with its overall operating profit.\nOn that note, I want to start by considering the revenue potential here. Amazon's AWS is one of the top cloud computing platforms in the world. Research from firms Mordor Intelligence, MarketsandMarkets, Grand View Research, and Fortune Business Insights predict compound annual growth for the industry between 15% and 21% through 2028 and longer.\nThe point isn't which research firm gets it exactly right. The point is that virtually all experts expect double-digit industry growth for a long time, which is a tremendous tailwind for growth for Amazon's AWS.\nDrilling down into the details of Amazon's report, however, AWS growth may be about to slow down. It's not normally in the press release. But in official quarterly filings, the company provides its remaining performance obligations, much of which is related to AWS. This is essentially future revenue under contract. Big growth from one quarter to the next can signal revenue growth for AWS in the near future.\nAt the end of Q2, Amazon had commitments of $157 billion compared to commitments of $158 billion in the first quarter. For perspective, that's a drop of $1 billion compared with a $10 billion jump in the same period of last year. It's not a foolproof predictor, but it could signal slowing AWS growth in the near term even though it has a strong industry tailwind.\nTurning to profitability, Amazon's management said it expects its expenses for AWS to go up in the back half of 2024 compared to the first half, specifically due to ongoing investments in artificial intelligence (AI). AI applications require specific hardware that the company has been buying in recent quarters, and it's a cost that's still going up.\nThese investments could impact the profitability of Amazon's AWS in coming quarters. Considering all of these things together, it's possible that Amazon's operating income is plateauing for the time being.\nAssuming growth for Amazon's AWS slows and its AI-related expenses rise, I believe it's fair to assume that the company's operating profit growth stalls. It's important for investors to keep things in perspective -- operating profit is at an all-time high and it's an incredible amount of money at nearly $55 billion annually. But if the growth slows, I'd expect this to impact Amazon stock.\nOver the next year or so, I predict that Amazon stock will remain largely where it is today. Keep in mind that it's still up about 15% over the past year even after its 20% drop from highs. That's still a healthy recent gain that shareholders should be content with.\nI wouldn't expect hot near-term gains for Amazon stock. That said, remember that the long-term outlook for cloud computing is still quite good. So within the next few years, I'd expect AWS to heat back up, leading to new highs for Amazon stock. It may just be an exercise of patience for shareholders.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

In my opinion, Amazon's Cloud strength and operating income momentum are solid indicators to where the company's focus lies.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nThis analysis dives into Amazon's operating and financial status, strategic decisions and future opportunities and why it is poised to stay as a potential opportunity for value investors.\nThe company's first-quarter 2024 performance was well-received by the market, but the stock has shown quite a bit of volatility since then. At one point, it fluctuated very close to the $200 resistance level, but did not cross it. However, when Amazon released a mixed second-quarter earnings report on Aug. 1, shares dropped 7% in after-hours trading, which, in my opinion, was an overstated response from the market.\nThe e-commerce giant delivered mixed results, beating earnings per share expectations but falling short on the revenue front. The consensus for earnings was $1.02, while its actual earnings were $1.26, which was 24 cents higher than projections. However, with revenue of $147.98 billion, Amazon missed Wall Street's forecast by $780 million.\nWhat stood out from Amazon's earnings release, and what we will be focusing on in this discussion, was the strong acceleration of growth and the massive operating income improvements in the Cloud segment. While e-commerce in North America also performed well for, the force undoubtedly belongs to the Cloud segment that is now expected to generate over $40 billion of the run-rate operating income in the next year. I believe investors are underestimating the potential for operating income growth, which may support further increases to its valuation and indicates where Amazon's future focus is pointed.\nContrary to headlines, overall, the second quarter was a good one for Amazon. Total revenue was up by 10.12% year over year, bringing total revenue for the first half up by 11.29%. The combination of an additional $13.59 billion in revenue and improved efficiency enabled the company to generate $14.67 billion in operating income, translating to a 91.02% year-over-year increase ($6.99 billion). However, the total revenue declined as compared to the previous quarter by 3 percentage points, primarily due to a slowdown in the e-commerce segment.\nAmazon Web Services, however, witnessed an increasing rate of revenue growth, rising from 17.20% in the first quarter to 18.88% in the second quarter. This is primarily due to the company's decision to transition from on-premise infrastructure to cloud solutions, citing the increasing demand to implement artificial intelligence technologies. Cloud businesses overall have remained robust during the most recent quarter with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) posting healthy revenue growth, suggesting these companies know where the future lies and are not cutting back on digital transformation investments.\nOne of main takeaways from the earnings report that I believe we will see more and more of in the future is that there is sustained operating income growth across all of Amazon's operations, especially cloud. With a market share of more than 30%, the cloud segment delivered 19% year-over-year growth. This was mainly due to signing new services contracts with Databricks, ServiceNow and GE HealthCare, among others, which I believe will only increase in the future.\nThe most critical figure is the amount of operating income the AWS segment incrementally added to the results. In the second quarter, the segment contributed $9.30 billion to operating income, which is a whopping 74% increase year over year. In comparison, the Google Cloud segment posted $1.20 billion in operating income. That means AWS made 8 times more profit for Amazon over the same period.\nAWS is progressing toward becoming a $100 billion-plus annual revenue company with around $40 billion of recurring operating income. Importantly, 57% of its total operating income growth came from the AWS segment in the second quarter. As we are entering a new generation of technological growth focused on AI, Amazon looks poised to capitalize on it like it did with the cloud in the early 2010s.\nIt is not just Amazon driving cloud growth, however. The whole cloud market is experiencing exponential growth. Currently, projections form Precedence Research indicate the cloud computing market has the potential to reach $2.30 trillion, growing at a rate of 17% annually with 2023 as the base year.\nAdvertising is another segment that has been expanding rapidly for Amazon, generating over $2 billion in additional revenue year over year. As such, there is potential in video advertising within the Prime Video service.\nCurrently, Amazon shares trade at a price-earnings ratio of 45, making it the second most expensive large-cap tech company after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which trades at a price-earnings ratio of 56. However, from a long-term earnings per share growth perspective, Amazon arguably remains one of the best investments as it is projected to grow its earnings at an annual rate of 23% in the long term, mainly because of its cloud business.\nIn my opinion, Amazon justifiably trades at one of the highest earnings multiples due to its stronger-than-average projected earnings per share growth. This growth primarily hinges on cloud and despite a slight top-line miss in the second quarter by the company as a whole, the cloud growth story remains intact. AWS is positioned for significant growth and new contract wins. I see operating income margin expansion as a catalyst for the stock, along with continued AI spending.\nGrowth in the AI and cloud markets requires constant investment. Amazon is sitting on $71.18 billion in cash on hand, with an additional $17.91 billion in short-term investments. With $89.09 billion in liquidity and only $54.89 billion in long-term debt, the company has a strong balance sheet, allowing it to allocate capital as needed to expand its operations without concerns about debt obligations.\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, this is the 8th consecutive quarter where Amazon's cash from operations increased along with its free cash flow. Having surpassed $100 billion in cash from operations on a trailing 12-month basis, the company is still spending over $50 billion annually on capital expenditures and generating $54.98 billion in free cash flow. I believe this allows it to continue increasing the amount of cash from operations it makes, and even if they feel the need to increase capex during the AI boom to accelerate growth, it should ultimately correlate to higher growth in FCF. Hence, it would have no apparent problem putting in more cash to accelerate its cloud and AI dominance.\nDespite Amazon's dominance, there are still some risks to consider as an investor. The biggest risk, in my view, is a potential slowdown in the cloud business or operating margin contraction if the U.S. enters a recession. While the company's cloud business is growing rapidly, its reliance on this segment for operating income gains is increasing.\nAnother risk lies in the e-commerce segment, which it still heavily relies on. The business accounted for over 65% of total second-quarter revenue. A recession could lead to reduced consumer spending, impacting e-commerce sales. It is essential not to overlook the challenges in the retail segment while focusing on AWS's growth. Having said that, Amazon's massive e-commerce scale suggests it is well-positioned to weather weakness compared to smaller peers.\nMoreover, Amazon Prime membership gives the company a highly competitive advantage to keep its e-commerce dominance. As seen below, its fast and reliable shipping capabilities are considered the \"number one reason\" for Prime membership.\nThe Amazon Prime-driven competitive advantages extend into Prime video. Over the past year, its advertising business has generated over $50 billion in revenue, positioning the company incredibly well in the digital advertising market.\nAmazon offers a promising growth outlook for the third quarter. With impressive cloud results, especially with regard to the incremental operating income growth, the company looks set to capture the cloud market as it did with the e-commerce market a decade ago. The Cloud segment is on track to achieve $40 billion or more in annual recurring operating income over the next 12 months based on run-rate results and with the secured contract wins for AWS segment in the second quarter alone.\nFrom a broader perspective, both sales growth and the operating margin look very good and are likely to remain strong going forward. This suggests that earnings per share can continue its upward trajectory for fiscal 2025. I see a huge opportunity in Amazon for long-term investors as generative AI and machine learning will drive additional revenue across various business segments in the future. The company's financial metrics are moving in the right direction, and based on historical levels, this may be one of the best times to invest in the stock.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announce their quarterly results within days of each other. This helps investors compare how the rivals stack up against each other in the highly competitive cloud services market.\nWith all three companies providing quarterly updates over the last two weeks, we know how the \"cloud wars\" are going. To sum things up: Amazon leads, Microsoft disappoints, and Google surges.\nAmazon reported its Q2 results on Aug. 1, 2024. The company entered the quarter as the undisputed king of cloud services, with 31% of the market. It still sits on the throne.\nIn the second quarter, Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue jumped 19% year over year to $26.3 billion. The segment generated operating income of $9.3 billion, up from $5.4 billion in the prior-year period. Amazon touted several new customers for AWS in Q2, including Discover Financial Services, Eli Lilly, and artificial intelligence (AI) start-up Perplexity.\nMicrosoft's Azure platform trails behind AWS in second place, with a market share of 25% earlier this year. Azure has been gaining ground, though, especially since Microsoft began integrating GPT-4 into its cloud services offerings in 2023.\nThat trend continued in the latest quarter. Microsoft announced its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results on July 30, 2024. The tech giant reported Azure and other cloud services revenue soared 29% year over year (30% in constant currency).\nWhile this growth was strong, it disappointed Wall Street. Analysts were expecting between 30% and 31% constant-currency revenue growth.\nGoogle Cloud has been a distant third to AWS and Azure. In Q1, it held a market share of 11%. However, Google Cloud's growth has accelerated.\nAlphabet reported its Q2 results on July 23, 2024. Google Cloud revenue surged roughly 29% year over year to a record-high $10.3 billion, with Google Cloud Platform services growing even more. The unit generated nearly $1.2 billion in operating profit in Q2, its first quarter for profits to top $1 billion.\nThere's more to the story than Amazon leading, Microsoft disappointing, and Google surging. All three cloud titans had good news to report in their recent quarterly updates.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said in the company's Q2 earnings call that \"three macro trends\" continue to drive AWS growth. First, customers are once again focusing on new efforts after completing most of their cost optimization efforts. Second, Jassy said they're \"modernizing their infrastructure and moving on-premise infrastructure to the cloud.\" Third, customers are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI).\nMicrosoft CFO Amy Hood acknowledged that the company faces AI capacity constraints. However, she said in the recent quarterly call that Azure's growth should accelerate in the second half of 2024 as AI capacity expands. The slightly disappointing growth in Q2 could be a blip that's quickly forgotten.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai noted in his company's earnings call, \"We are the only cloud provider to offer grounding with Google Search.\" He added, \"Our AI-powered applications portfolio is helping us win new customers and drive upsell.\"\nThe Gemini large language models (LLMs) are key to this success. Pichai said that Gemini's support for 2 million tokens is \"the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to date\" and \"powers developer use cases that no other model can handle.\"\nWars typically result in one or more parties emerging as the victors and other parties ending up as the vanquished. However, I think with the cloud wars, there will be winners all around.\nAmazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet should all have tremendous growth opportunities for years to come with their cloud businesses. All three stocks are great picks for long-term investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sydney Lake ",
        "Text": "Many software engineers dream of working for one of the elite FAANG companies\u2014Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google. But interview processes are rigorous across the board, ensuring only the most qualified candidates are hired.\nAnd at Amazon, the bar is even higher\u2014literally. The e-commerce giant has had a unique hiring practice in place since the late 1990s called \u201cbar raisers,\u201d where an interviewer who typically sits on another team serves as an objective third-party adviser during the hiring process. There were a whopping 3,600 bar raisers at Amazon as of October 2019, but they had been removed from the interview process for entry-level software engineers in recent years during a pandemic hiring boom.\nBut Amazon is reinstating bar raisers into the interview process for entry-level software engineering jobs, called \u201cSDE-1 (L4)\u201d roles, according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly reviewing and improving our hiring practices to ensure we\u2019re hiring the best talent to innovate for our customers,\u201d Margaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, told Fortune.\nAmazon declined to say whether removing bar raisers from the SDE-1 roles had led to a drop in talent quality, as Business Insider reporting suggests. However, reinstating the bar-raiser program for these roles \u201cis addressing a direct business need and aims to enhance the quality of SDE-1 candidates hired,\u201d according to the memo obtained by Business Insider.\nThere are thousands of bar raisers at Amazon who volunteer their time contributing to the interview process. They undergo a rigorous training process, sitting in on dozens of interviews before officially entering the program. Bar raisers aren\u2019t paid extra for the work they contribute as part of the interview process.\n\u201cThese individuals, who are typically experienced employees from different departments, are trained to evaluate candidates not just for the immediate role but also for long-term potential and overall fit with Amazon's culture,\u201d Tearra Bourgeois, a former Amazon human resources business partner, told Fortune. \u201cThey bring an objective perspective and help mitigate biases that might occur when hiring managers are pressured to fill positions quickly.\u201d\nAmazon employees must be nominated by their manager, peers, or another bar raiser in order to be considered for the program. They can come from any part of the company, ranging in roles including product management, software development, human resources, and marketing. Aspiring bar raisers also have to complete an \u201cextensive training\u201d on Amazon\u2019s 16 Leadership Principles, which include \u201ccustomer obsession, ownership, think big, and frugality.\u201d\nBar raisers are charged with understanding the full picture of a candidate, Callahan said, and can help drive final hiring decisions. They\u2019re \u201cespecially important during the evaluation stage\u201d by driving the debrief discussion following an interview. A major part of their role is also to evaluate whether a candidate has the potential to grow in their role, Callahan said. Hence the name: The main purpose of a bar raiser is to keep the hiring bar high, she said.\n\u201cOne could speculate that Amazon brought [bar raisers] back based on data to continue and maintain this consistent, high-quality hiring standard and to reinforce the importance of cultural fit and long-term potential in their hiring decisions,\u201d Bourgeois said.\nWhile Amazon declined to share with Fortune the types of questions a bar raiser might ask during an interview process, they\u2019re in charge of evaluating the candidate\u2019s core competencies for the job they\u2019re applying for and whether they\u2019ll meet the desired performance outcomes.\nBar raisers typically ask questions to assess a candidate\u2019s long-term cultural fit and alignment with the company\u2019s leadership principles, Bourgeois said, which can include detailing a time when they\u2019ve had to make a difficult decision with limited information or how the candidate has \u201cdemonstrated customer obsession\u201d in previous roles, she said. Candidates are also asked questions such as \u201cImagine you are leading a project and the timeline is cut in half. How would you adjust your approach to ensure success?\u201d and \u201cDescribe a complex problem you have solved. What was your approach, and what were the results?\u201d\nAmazon bar raisers also ask fellow interviewers questions during the debrief following an interview.\n\u201cI've learned some key questions that get hiring managers to really think about the role and the decision,\u201d Annie Groeninger, a former software development manager, told Amazon for an article about the bar-raiser program. \u201cSome of my favorites to ask are, 'What does Amazon miss out on if we don't hire this person?' and 'What about this person makes you want to work with them?'\"\nGroeninger, who worked at Amazon for more than a decade, became a bar raiser after completing 800 interviews.\nWhile one might tend to believe software engineering interview questions and practices would be solely tech-focused, candidates are more frequently being asked and evaluated on behavioral questions.\n\u201cSimilar practices are becoming more common in tech companies, though they might go by different names. The tech industry is highly competitive, and companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft implement rigorous hiring processes to ensure they attract and retain top talent,\u201d said Bourgeois, who now serves as an HR business partner for AmTrust Financial Services. \u201cHowever, not all companies adopt this practice due to the resources and training required to implement and sustain this type of program effectively. Smaller companies or those in less competitive industries might not find it as feasible.\u201d\nOne of the main benefits of Amazon\u2019s bar-raiser program is balancing out a hiring team, Matt Collingwood, managing director of VIQU IT Recruitment, told Fortune.\n\u201cThe main benefit of a bar raiser is they can balance out a hiring team,\u201d said Collingwood, who has more than 27 years of experience in IT recruiting. \u201cWhen the hiring team [is] overly positive about a hire, a bar raiser could offer a more cautious or balanced view. This can contribute to a more stringent hiring process.\u201d\nHowever, it\u2019s important that bar raisers are trained rigorously, but also have an understanding of the individual team\u2019s culture and identity ahead of the interviewing process.\n\u201cA drawback of a bar raiser is that they may not understand the team culture they are looking to hire into,\u201d he said. \u201cThe individuals in that team will know what type of personality would fit best.\u201d\nBut Amazon\u2019s bar-raiser program is more about building a cohesive company culture\u2014and not just a team.\n\"The role of a bar raiser is unique because we will not be involved in the day-to-day interaction with the interviewee, so we're completely focused on making hiring decisions for Amazon, not for a specific team or role,\u201d Groeninger told Amazon. \u201cOur ability [is] to maintain a long-term vision rather than focus on an immediate hiring need.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  John Kingston ",
        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s earnings, released after the market close Thursday, were notable on several key points. Among them:\nWall Street\u2019s reaction was decidedly negative. At about 4:40 p.m. EDT, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock was down about 4.4%, to $175.94. It had been down 1.56% on the day to $184.07. The decrease occurred even though its earnings per share under GAAP measurements of $1.26 beat consensus forecasts by 23 cts/share, according to SeekingAlpha.\nThe negative stock market reaction was reported to be primarily driven by the company\u2019s guidance. Amazon said it expected net sales to be between $154 billion and $158.5 billion in the third quarter. But news reports said analysts had been forecasting third quarter net sales at $158.4 billion, citing Bloomberg data.\nOne piece of data not in the earnings but will likely be in the company\u2019s 10Q, yet to be filed, is a significant gain on its shares of electric vehicle maker Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), according to Tomi Kilgore of Marketwatch. Kilgore, in a commentary on Amazon\u2019s earnings, noted that Amazon owns more than 158 million shares of Rivian Automotive Inc. That stock at the end of the second quarter was $13.42, up 22.6% from where it closed at the end of the first quarter, $10.95. Kilogore noted that Amazon did disclose earlier this week that its investments in publicly traded companies were $2.525 billion at the end of the quarter. That was up from $2.117 billion at the end of the first quarter, and\u00a0 Rivian\u2019s increase in price has been a key contributor to the rise in that asset line, according to Kilgore.\nAmong the operating highlights cited by Amazon in its prepared earnings statement, the company said it \u201cdelivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever in the first half of the year.\u201d\nKey measurements showed significant growth compared to the prior year. Net product sales for Amazon were up 4.3%. Net service sales, which includes AWS, rose 4.7%. Operating income was up 91% and consolidated net income almost doubled, to $13.5 billion.\nIn North America, net sales exclusive of AWS rose to $90 billion from $82.5 billion. News reports said CFO Brian Olsavsky, in a conference call with reporters after the release of the earnings, said Amazon \u201cdid come in a little short on revenue growth in North America vs. our internal estimates.\u201d According to the reports, the CFO said consumers were ratcheting down what they were willing to pay and were buying cheaper products. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is really around ASP and lower ASP in products selected by customers,\u201d Olsavsky said, according to the products. \u201cThey are continuing to be cautious in their spending and trading down to lower (average selling price) products.\u201d\nAWS net sales jumped to $26.3 billion from $22.1 billion a year ago, and with operating expenses holding relatively steady, operating income climbed to $9.33 billion from $5.36 billion a year ago.\nIn the prepared statement that had few quotes from management in it, AWS and its adoption of AI stood out. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d Andy Jassy, president and CEO of Amazon said. \u201cAs companies continue to modernize their infrastructure and move to the cloud, while also leveraging new Generative AI opportunities, AWS continues to be customers\u2019 top choice as we have much broader functionality, superior security and operational performance, a larger partner ecosystem, and AI capabilities like SageMaker for model builders, Bedrock for those leveraging frontier models, Trainium for those where the cost of compute for training and inference matters, and Q for those wanting the most capable GenAI assistant for not just coding, but also software development and business integration.\u201d\nMore articles by John Kingston\nRyder, reporting sluggish earnings growth, sees \u2018trough\u2019 in freight market\nBacked by big companies and labor, Supply Chain Council debuts\nVictory for a 3PL again \u2014 TQL \u2014 in case involving broker liability\nThe post First look: Amazon stock slides after projections for 3Q revenue appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this online retailer have returned -4.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has lost 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $1.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +35.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.5%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +63.5%. This estimate has changed +2.9% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.84 indicates a change of +23.2% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $157.05 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $634.49 billion and $702.77 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +10.8% changes, respectively.\nAmazon reported revenues of $147.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.63 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.44%. The EPS surprise was +17.14%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Amazon axes a major fee for sellers ahead of the crucial holiday shopping rush",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Amazon angered many longtime sellers earlier this year by tacking on two new fees that merchants said complicated their business operations, even for the most sophisticated of them. The furor was so extreme that the Federal Trade Commission contacted sellers about the fees amid the agency's antitrust suit against the tech giant.\nBut on Thursday, Amazon announced the elimination of another fee ahead of the holiday shopping season that impacted hundreds of thousands of U.S. sellers. The so-called \"overage\" fee penalized sellers whose inventory in Amazon warehouses exceeded the limit set by the company, either because customer demand had slowed or for other reasons.\n\"The fee removal is in part due to Amazon\u2019s more effective capacity management features, and we are glad to be able to eliminate these fees and allow sellers to not worry about them as we head into peak,\" Amazon vice president Dharmesh Mehta wrote on LinkedIn, alluding to the busy holiday shopping season. \"We hope this will help more sellers ensure they have enough inventory ready for peak demand this holiday shopping season.\"\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the company will still set inventory capacity limits for sellers, but they will no longer be charged extra if sales are slow and their in-stock inventory exceeds their threshold. However, sellers will be unable to add to their inventory if their in-stock inventory plus in-transit restocks surpass their limit. The fee cancellation will be retroactive to July 1.\nThe holiday season will be crucial for Amazon and its sellers, who account for around 60% of total goods sold on the shopping platform and whose fees contributed $140 billion of revenue to the tech giant in 2023\u2014or nearly a quarter of its total net sales.\nAmazon's stock price dropped more than 10% over the past week after its third-quarter sales forecast fell below analyst estimates. Amazon's chief financial officer blamed the shortfall on consumers being distracted from shopping by a busy news cycle and warned that shoppers are cautious about spending and are therefore buying less-expensive brands when possible.\nIn recent years, Amazon's rising seller fees have caused widespread angst among merchants using its platform, with outrage reaching a crescendo following the addition of two new U.S. fees earlier this year. One new fee penalized sellers who had too little inventory in stock. Another, known as the \"inbound placement\" fee, penalized sellers who didn't ship their inventory to at least four different Amazon warehouses. Previously, sellers could ship inventory to one Amazon facility and the tech giant would then foot the bill of transferring it between warehouses in its network.\nLast week, during an earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy referred to the new fee as \"the incentive we've given sellers to send their items to multiple Amazon inbound facilities so they can save money.\" He said the resulting seller behavior of shipping inventory to more Amazon warehouses to avoid the fee is \"getting more traction than we'd even hoped.\"\nOn LinkedIn, one Amazon seller responded to a post about Jassy's comments with an image of a carrot and a stick, signaling a belief that the fee creates more of a reward and punishment dynamic than a mere incentive.\n\"A refresher may be in order ahead of the next earnings call,\" the seller quipped with a winking emoji, alluding to a difference of opinion with Jassy's definition.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  GlobalData ",
        "Text": "US e-commerce giant Amazon has unveiled an advanced AI model designed to refine its Just Walk Out checkout technology, offering more accurate and efficient shopping experiences.\nLaunched in 2018, Just Walk Out enables customers at physical stores to purchase items without the need for traditional checkouts.\nThe upgraded Just Walk Out AI technology is set to deliver quicker receipt generation for customers, addressing complex variables such as camera obstructions and varying lighting conditions.\nThe latest Just Walk Out multi-modal foundation model improves accuracy by leveraging the previous transformer-based machine learning models and applies them to physical stores.\nThe upgraded system works a lot faster than earlier iterations and is easier for retailers to install. Shoppers simply supply their payment information, credit card or mobile wallet upon entry to a store, then shop and leave.\nThe technology can now process sensor data in unison rather than sequentially and can assess multiple inputs such as cameras and weight sensors to accurately identify the items a shopper selects.\nThe AI system employs continuous self-learning and transformer technology - a neural network architecture that processes sensor data into outputs, such as receipts for checkout-free shopping.\nThis reduces the need for frequent model retraining, even in new shopping environments, as the system continuously adapts and learns.\nTo facilitate Just Walk Out's ongoing learning, the system is trained on a 3D map of the store, understanding the placement of fixtures and products.\nIt uses an image catalogue of store merchandise to visually identify items, allowing it to recognise shopper behaviour even when faced with store layout changes.\nThis technology is currently implemented in 170 third-party locations across the US, UK, Australia and Canada, including airports, stadiums and hospitals.\nAWS Applications Just Walk Out technology vice-president Jon Jenkins said: \u201cWe will launch more Just Walk Out stores in 2024 than any year prior, more than doubling the number of third-party stores with the technology this year. As we scale, the system will continue to learn from everyday shopping scenarios and raise the bar for accuracy and convenience, delivering the benefits of AI to retailers and customers around the world.\u201d\nIn July 2024 Amazon announced plans to expand its Just Walk Out technology to the O2, a premier live entertainment and retail venue in London, UK, by the end of the year.\n\"Amazon develops new AI model for Just Walk Out technology\" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Matt Day ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. has deployed a new secret weapon in its same-day delivery operation: a convoy of Kia Souls.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money\nBiden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction\nIn DNC, Chicago\u2019s Embattled Transit System Faces a High-Profile Test\nJohannesburg Mayor Quits Amid Infighting, Financial Woes\nGottheimer Calls for Rail Riders to Be Reimbursed for Delays\nThe boxy little vehicles, already zooming around metro areas such as Seattle and Dallas, are a recent addition to the company\u2019s six-year-old Delivery Service Partner initiative, which outsources the hiring and management of drivers to small contracting firms that typically lease Prime-branded trucks and vans.\nWhile van drivers mostly work full shifts hauling 200 or more packages, the Kia drivers are usually part-timers who might bring 50 items on a four- or five-hour shift, according to job postings and people familiar with the initiative.\nThe new service is designed to handle quick deliveries that the company currently delegates to its Amazon Flex gig economy service, say the people, who requested anonymity to discuss an internal matter. Broadening out beyond the depots and delivery firms currently piloting the program could give Amazon greater control over deliveries and reduce its reliance on Flex, which has been criticized for treating workers unfairly \u2014 a charge the company denies.\nChief Executive Officer Andy Jassy is determined to streamline and speed up Amazon\u2019s logistics network, which doubled in size during the pandemic. The company has shuttered warehouses even as it continues to build massive new ones, and is staging goods at facilities closer to customers. Today, Amazon says fewer employees handle each package, which in turn allows them to make shorter trips.\nOn a call with analysts earlier this month, Jassy said there were \u201ca number of opportunities to further reduce costs\u201d in logistics, including increasing the use of automation and robotics and expanding the number of same-day delivery sites.\nAmazon pitched its new service, the Same Day Delivery Program for Delivery Service Partners, at a conference for contract drivers last September, according to one of the people. The company has launched or plans to launch the service in Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Texas and Washington, according to the people and job postings. On a website for delivery contractors, Amazon says the program gives drivers more flexible working hours and routes \u201cusing smaller passenger vehicles or cargo vans.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re always testing new ways to support our Delivery Service Partners, and multiple shorter routes in a given day is something that they have requested,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said in an emailed statement. \u201cThis approach also supports our fast same-day orders that Prime customers love.\u201d\nThe Kia Soul drivers deliver packages from what Amazon calls \u201csub-same day\u201d warehouses, depots typically located closer to urban customers than the company\u2019s massive fulfillment centers. Amazon last year said it would double the count of such facilities in the coming years, part of a push to stay ahead of big US retail rivals and upstarts like Temu and Shein that can\u2019t typically match Amazon on delivery speed.\nThose sub-same day warehouses now primarily use Amazon Flex drivers, who drive their own vehicles. During periods of peak demand, they have earned as much as $30 a hour, relatively decent money for this kind of work. But four US-based Flex drivers, who requested anonymity to avoid alienating Amazon, say these so-called surge payments have grown vanishingly rare. Three of the drivers, who deliver in large metropolitan areas, say base pay rates at some warehouses they frequent have been cut in the last year. The company says US Flex drivers are paid more than $26 an hour.\nThe on-demand employment model, which Flex shares with Uber and DoorDash, remains controversial. Labor activists argue that drivers should be classified as Amazon employees entitled to health care and other benefits, claims drivers occasionally make in court. Some 16,000 Flex drivers filed arbitration claims earlier this year, arguing that Amazon wrongly denied them wages and other compensation. The company has said the program lets workers set their own schedules and be their own boss.\n\u201cAmazon Flex is and will continue to play an integral role in our growing last-mile delivery network, and claims to the contrary are inaccurate,\u201d spokesperson Kelly said.\nSpencer Patton, who advises Amazon delivery contractors, said shifting deliveries from Flex to Delivery Service Partners gives the company more control. DSPs are technically independent businesses and employ their drivers directly, but Amazon exercises a great deal of sway over how they operate. Patton also said that using part-timers driving inexpensive vehicles is much cheaper than paying delivery contractors using vans with higher fixed costs.\n\u201cIt make sense for Amazon,\u201d he said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside Worldcoin\u2019s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity\nNew Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas)\nSurgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

It's investing in all over its business to keep up the momentum, specifically in improving e-commerce and in developing generative artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe market wasn't enthused by management's guidance for third-quarter sales to increase 8% to 11%, but that's within the typical range.\nAmazon generally beats its own expectations. Here's a chart of management's guidance for the past four quarters, along with what actually happened.\nRevenue growth\nQ2 2024\nQ1 2024\nQ4 2023\nQ3 2023\nGuidance range\n7% to 11%\n8% to 13%\n7% to 12%\n9% to 13%\nActual\n10%\n13%\n14%\n13%\nData source: Amazon quarterly reports. Rates are year over year.\nThe second quarter was close to the top of the expected range, but not as much as previous quarters, which came in at the top or beat it entirely. It's likely that Amazon will come in toward the top of guidance in the third quarter, but not a given.\nAmazon keeps getting bigger, and the bigger it gets, the harder it is to build on top in percentage. For example, total sales were $148 billion in the second quarter. While absolute growth isn't impossible, profitability could be lower.\nIn a year from now, Amazon should be a lot bigger, and it could even surpass Walmart to become the largest company in the world by sales.\nAndy Jassy has been curtailing spend in many areas. He cut headcount and spearheaded an e-commerce overhaul that's faster and more efficient. However, management is investing substantially in AWS's AI services as it races with Microsoft and Alphabet to capture market share in the growing and lucrative cloud computing segment.\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. Aside from the obvious, which is that it's trying to stay on top of the competition, management has made it clear in the past that this is how the model works. It has periods of heavy investments and periods of incredible profitability.\nManagement is guiding operating income between $11.5 billion and $15.0 billion for the third quarter, up from $11.2 billion last year. That's a sharp slowdown. Operating income nearly doubled in the second quarter, and it grew even faster in the previous three quarters.\nWhile it invests in AWS, the e-commerce business is becoming more efficient. That gives it some wiggle room to pump money into generative AI and still report solid operating performance for the whole company. Management said that because of the new regional fulfillment strategy, Amazon is able to consolidate shipments and cut transportation time and fees. That results in lower costs and happier customers.\nAmazon's high-margin advertising business, now reported as a separate segment, once again registered the highest growth among segment, with sales up 20% more than last year. However, that's a deceleration from previous quarters, and it's something to keep an eye on over the next year. Management sees a tremendous opportunity in video streaming ads, which it's just getting started with.\nIn a year from now, the generative AI business is likely to still be at the forefront of the industry, and Amazon's focus specifically. It should, however, achieve its intent of onboarding new business and benefiting from increased client spend. Management said that it continues to see businesses ending their cost optimization efforts, and since 90% of spend is still not in the cloud, the opportunity is enormous. AWS is also a high-margin business, and its growth could eclipse the impact of Amazon's investments.\nAmazon is growing its other businesses, too. Its pharmacy division is taking off, and it's producing hit streaming content through Amazon MGM Studios. In a year from now, these should continue to grow, and Amazon is likely to roll out new services and businesses.\nWhen you're looking to invest, it's important to look for patterns. Does Amazon usually beat guidance? Will Amazon go through compression periods as it builds to come out stronger? Does it bounce back from setbacks? And finally, is management capable of rolling out new products and services profitably? The answer to all of those questions is yes, and Amazon is a great long-term buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Amazon Still Attractive After Earnings",
        "Author": "  Kenio Fontes ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s famous advice to \"be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful\" is a very interesting approach to buying good companies at good prices. Finding a good company that has a good price and is going through a good time with clear prospects is often quite difficult, but for long-term investors who have the stomach for the good old buy and hold, buying good companies at good prices but that are going through a delicate time or with slightly cloudy prospects is often enough.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nIn my opinion, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) fits the bill. After posting mixed second-quarter earnings, which disappointed the market with a miss in revenue and worse-than-expected guidance for the next quarter, the shares retreated sharply before recovering.\nThis, together with the tech sell-off and fears of a recession, means Amazon is at one of the best valuation levels in recent years, even though it is worth around $1.86 trillion.\nLooking at the multiples, Amazon is cheaper than it was years ago, even though it has improved substantially in terms of revenue, market share, options and cash generation. After the dip, the forward price-earnings ratio reached its historic low of 36, while the price-to-operating cash flow ratio reached 16.50, close to the levels seen in the 2008 recession and other more troubled periods, which means this multiple is also close to its low of 13.30 and far from its mean of 27.50 over the last 20 years. Note these multiples are reaching their lowest level even though free cash flow over the last 12 months has reached its highest level.\nSource: GuruFocus\nFor the stock to be trading so far from its averages and for a bargain of 16 times its operating cash flow, you might think the prospects have changed, but no. In fact, according to the estimates, expectations for Amazon remain excellent. Over the next three years, the revenue growth rate is estimated at 10.80%, earnings per share at 35.20% and operating cash flow per share at 30%.\nIt may seem disproportionately cheap for a stock that is expected to grow its cash from operations by 30% and is still trading at only 16 times, but there are some reasons that inflate this indicator and should be clarified. One of the reasons is capital expenditures, though cash generated by operating activities was $108 billion over the last 12 months, the capital expenditure was almost $60 billion, putting pressure on the generation of shareholder value in the short term. As I highlighted previously, in the short term this capex is likely to remain high to support the growth of Amazon Web Services, automation and other initiatives. In the words of management, the second half of 2024 is set to be higher to \"support the growing need for AWS infrastructure.\" At some point, as these initiatives mature, this capex should decline and, consequently, free cash flow will expand.\nAnother reason for operating cash flow being higher than net income is stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense that dilutes the shareholder over time and depending on the volume can be detrimental in the long term. Cash generation for the shareholder is expected to increase much faster than the amount by which the shareholder is diluted by the stock-based compensation, to the extent that value generation for the shareholder is greater and compensates for this negative factor. Not only that, but at some point in the next few years when operating cash flow increases and capex decreases, the buyback and other forms of shareholder remuneration may increase and surpass the stock-based compensation. But even with this positive outlook, there is no guarantee this will happen, so it may continue to be a relevant pressure for value generation in the medium term and benefit these price-to-cash flow indicators and should be monitored.\nSomething interesting to note is the longer history is not so positive, with stock-based compensation increasing significantly along with operating cash flow. However, in the most recent period, there has been a certain stability in this type of compensation, while cash flow continues to grow substantially.\nSource: GuruFocus\nAll this implies that Amazon shares are trading at an attractive level compared to their own history and considering future prospects. It is hard to say that a stock trading at more than 35 times earnings is a bargain, but we must balance this by considering not only the size of its moats, but also the amount the company can generate and the pace at which it will be able to increase this cash flow. Amazon, therefore, has a fair valuation and is not an expensive company for what it offers.\nIt is not possible to justify this discount on stocks with second-quarter earnings, since although they were not entirely positive, they were not that bad either. Revenue was $147.98 billion, while estimates were for $148.78 billion, but the consensus on AWS revenue was surprising.\nOn the other hand, earnings per share came in at $1.26 while Wall Street was expecting something close to $1.02.\nFor the next quarter, Amazon expects revenue between $154 billion and $158.50 billion and operating income in the range of $11.50 billion and $15 billion, disappointing the market which expected higher volumes. Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky justified these assumptions with some factors, such as pressure on margins in the third quarter due to Prime Day deals and marketing spend on account of the event and consumer attention on other events around the world.\nOn the positive side, the operating margin reached 10%, up 4 percentage points year over year, driven mainly by better margins at AWS and International, which were up 11 percentage pointes and 4 points respectively. Despite the cloudy expectations for AWS's margins in the medium term, it is interesting to note the company's initiatives to reduce cost-to-serve, improve inventory and other profitability initiatives are maturing and are already showing results, especially for the International segment, which until recently was unprofitable and now, with the start of operating leverage and these strategies, already has a margin of 0.90%.\nAnother factor driving the brief decline in Amazon's stock was the fear of a recession, brought on by triggers such as weaker employment data and an interest rate increase in Japan.\nAt first glance, a recession is bad for Amazon's operations and should have some impact on its fundamentals. In recessions, it is common for there to be lower consumer spending, which directly affects sales growth, as well as possible margin pressures due to price, lower cost dilution and other potential challenges.\nThis is obvious since a large part of Amazon's operations come from retail, which is a segment that is very affected by the economic environment, with a lot of competition. With worse data on inflation, unemployment, citizens' disposable income and more, expectations for people buying from Amazon or even being willing to sign up for subscriptions or spend on ads are reduced, especially for non-essential products. If there is this macroeconomic pressure on the consumer, not only will they think twice before buying products such as household and kitchen appliances, but if that product is cheaper at a competitor, the customer will possibly give up the quality of the service in favor of a cheaper price, which can lead to a price war and a reduction in margins.\nBut in second-level thinking, a recession could benefit Amazon in the medium term. The e-commerce giant is known not only for its very good service, with its fast delivery and ease of shopping, but also for its very competitive prices. This is made possible by its incredible gains in scale due to its colossal size. If there is one player in the retail sector that is able to survive the recession, it is Amazon, which means that, in this scenario, there is less competition as smaller companies become less competitive and this ends up translating into a gain in market share for the large, established players. Further, although some non-essentials are affected in this environment, some of Amazon's products can be considered essential, showing little fluctuation even in more complex scenarios.\nAnd that's if a challenging macroeconomic environment that lasts does materialize since as the American economy is quite resilient, there is a possibility that the signals in parts are just noise or other positive factors compensate.\nIn any case, I believe the best stance to adopt is something balanced, buying a good company at good prices is good, so adding exposure to Amazon after it dips seems interesting to me since it still has its moat and great growth prospects.\nAt the same time, it is not plausible to get rid of all your cash or allocate a large sum just because of a short-term dip. The current share price can serve as an opportunity, but it's not a huge dip.\nIn short, Amazon is not exactly recession-proof, but it has enough of a moat and financial strength to survive bad times and eventually return to growth. The company has a financial strength score of 8 out of 10, with more than $70 billion of cash on hand (although a significant amount of long-term debt) and consistent and growing operating cash generation.\nSource: GuruFocus\nThe most recent quarter came with some positive news, such as improved margins and a continuation of growth, but it also brought some uncertainty for the next quarter, with a more cautious outlook on growth and some margin hurdles. This was further catalyzed by fears of recession and a sell-off in big tech.\nEven so, if we consider a longer investment horizon, Amazon is likely to remain a solid company that can increase shareholder value generation. Its capex of $50 billion reinforces that the company still has a lot to capture in terms of revenue growth and efficiency improvements.\nThe company's internal strategies, coupled with its leadership in the cloud, retail, logistics and other sectors, make it a resilient company even in the most challenging scenarios. Perhaps at first Amazon will be affected by a more complex landscape, but again, for investors who have the cash to take advantage of the dips and a long investment horizon, it should benefit and be able to capture this generation of value.\nAll in all, at current prices Amazon can be considered a company that offers a good risk-return ratio and encompasses both a reasonable valuation and excellent prospects.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  Shilpa Mete ",
        "Text": "Amazon AMZN has seen its stock plunge 19.1% in the past month. This drop is wider than the 15.3% and 7.4% declines of the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry and the S&P 500, respectively.The AMZN stock has taken a sharp downturn, which can be primarily attributed to its lower-than-expected second-quarter 2024 revenues. Although strength in Prime, growing relationships with third-party seller and accelerating online store sales were positive, foreign exchange headwinds and changing consumer spending patterns were concerning.\nThe e-commerce giant provided weak third-quarter 2024 revenue guidance. It expects net sales between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, the mid-point of which ($156.25 billion) was below the expectation on Aug 1. The mid-point is also below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $157.03 billion.\nConsumers\u2019 growing preference for lower-ticket items, such as everyday essentials and consumables, and avoiding luxury or expensive purchases are hurting Amazon\u2019s sales growth. It has also been observed that consumers nowadays tend to wait longer to make a purchase or discard their cart completely. The reasons behind this unusual distraction of customers remain macro headwinds, high inflation and gearing up for national events like the presidential election.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nThis situation has put investors at a crossroads, raising the question: is it time to buy, hold or sell the AMZN stock?\nAlthough the downturn in the retail business remains a major concern for the company, its dominant position in the booming cloud computing market on the back of continued strength in the cloud computing business \u2014 Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d) \u2014 remains encouraging. In second-quarter 2024, AWS revenues rose 19% year over year to $26.3 billion (18% of net sales), driven by strengthening generative AI capabilities.\nAWS is gaining significantly from the solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.The company recently introduced Bedrock innovations, including custom model import and model evaluation capabilities, and Guardrails. These features are designed to provide customers a secure, easy and fast way to develop advanced generative AI applications.With a wide selection of foundation models from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI and Stability AI, Bedrock offers seamless deployment, scalability and continuous optimization.AWS also offers a generative AI-powered assistant called Amazon Q, which generates codes, tests and debugs, and has multi-step planning and reasoning capabilities.The company\u2019s collaboration with NVIDIA, through which it will make the latter\u2019s Blackwell GPU platform available on AWS, is a plus. This will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion-parameter language models.\nAWS is witnessing solid customer momentum on the back of its strengthening generative AI capabilities.The latest collaboration of Exscientia EXAI with AWS remains noteworthy. Per the terms, Exscientia is expanding the use of AWS\u2019s AI and machine learning services to accelerate early drug development at a lower cost. It is leveraging generative AI models of AWS to design drug candidates efficiently. It has deployed generative AI in its DesignStudio. EXAI draws on large language models via Amazon Bedrock.SAP recently teamed up with AWS to embed generative AI solutions across its enterprise resource planning applications. SAP integrates generative AI models from Amazon Bedrock, such as the Anthropic Claude 3 model family and Amazon Titan, into its generative AI hub in SAP AI Core.CrowdStrike extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. It is using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker in order to boost innovation in SIEM transformation, and novel cybersecurity AI use cases.Brightcove started using Amazon\u2019s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media and entertainment technology sectors.Smartsheet has also implemented Amazon Q Business to introduce a generative AI-powered assistant for its employees.BlackBerry leverages Amazon Bedrock to power its generative AI-backed cybersecurity advisor called Cylance Assistant.We believe that AWS\u2019s expanding customer base will drive its top-line growth in the days ahead.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 AWS revenues is pegged at $106.6 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 17.4%.Expanding clientele will also continue to help AWS sustain its dominant position in the global cloud market, and gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google.\nAmazon\u2019s long-term prospects are expected to benefit from the solid momentum in AWS, primarily driven by growing generative AI capabilities. An expanding data center network, a strong portfolio, and an increasing number of AWS Regions and Availability Zones remain a plus.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $634.78 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 10.4%.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings stands at $4.73 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 62.1%. The estimate has been revised upward by 2.8% over the past seven days and 3.3% over the past 30 days.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon, being the cloud giant, presents a solid investment opportunity due to its deepening focus on generative AI, AI integration and innovative product development.However, the company\u2019s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish growth in e-commerce sales. Geo-political tensions, foreign exchange headwinds, recessionary fears, high inflation and regional labor market constraints are concerning for its retail business.Moreover, AMZN is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 2.49X compared with the industry\u2019s 1.75X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nFor current shareholders, holding on to the stock seems prudent, as the company\u2019s fundamental strengths and growth drivers are intact. However, new investors should consider waiting for a more attractive entry point, possibly on further dips, to ensure that they are not overpaying for future growth.\nCurrently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

That is because the Sep 20, 2024 $45.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Amazon shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Amazon is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Internet - Commerce industry that ranks in the Top 25% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, four analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while nine have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.18 per share to $1.15 in that period.\nGiven the way analysts feel about Amazon right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

        "Author": "  Josh Eidelson ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. was legally the boss of a group of subcontracted delivery drivers, US labor board prosecutors have concluded, rejecting the company\u2019s claims that workers in its sprawling delivery network aren\u2019t its employees.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNazi Bunker\u2019s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher\nChicago Overcomes DNC Skeptics With Calm, Parties and Sun\nHow the Corti\u00e7os of S\u00e3o Paulo Helped Shelter South America\u2019s Largest City\nThe general counsel office of the US National Labor Relations Board has determined that a group of drivers in Southern California were employees of Amazon itself, as well as of the \u201cdelivery service partner\u201d company that hired them, agency spokesperson Kayla Blado said Thursday.\nThe agency prosecutors also concluded that Amazon violated federal labor law by making illegal threats and refusing to negotiate after the workers organized last year with the Teamsters. Absent a settlement, the agency\u2019s regional director plans to issue a formal complaint against Amazon, deeming it a \u201cjoint employer,\u201d meaning a company with enough control over workers\u2019 conditions to be legally responsible if they\u2019re mistreated \u2014 and obligated to negotiate if they unionize.\nAmazon denied wrongdoing. \u201cAs we have said all along, there is no merit to the Teamsters\u2019 claims,\u201d company spokesperson Eileen Hards said in a statement, noting that the agency dismissed other allegations from the union. \u201cIf and when the agency decides it wants to litigate the remaining allegations, we expect they will be dismissed as well.\u201d\nThe company has denied being the boss of its subcontracted drivers, saying that those workers are only employees of delivery service partners, or DSPs \u2014 small independent businesses that the retail giant contracts with for its delivery needs.\nDelivery drivers are responsible for a crucial aspect of Amazon\u2019s business, and by not directly employing them, the company has shielded itself from costs and liabilities that come with their work.\nWhile the NLRB determination applies to a small group of drivers at a DSP that Amazon has already cut off work with, it creates a landmark precedent that could affect the company\u2019s operations nationwide. More subcontracted drivers may now try to unionize and force Amazon to negotiate with them, and have a better chance of also being deemed by the government to be jointly employed by the company.\nBloomberg News reported in 2021 that Amazon imposes extensive rules regarding such drivers, including policies requiring \u201cclean teeth, face/ears, fingernails and hair,\u201d as well as drug testing whenever requested by the company. There\u2019s also a prohibition on \u201cobscene\u201d social media posts.\nDSPs are mandated to adhere to Amazon\u2019s policies, which the company can unilaterally change at its discretion, and are required to provide the retailer with physical access to their premises and information such as geolocation data, speed and movement of the drivers, according to a contract viewed by Bloomberg at the time.\nComplaints issued by NLRB prosecutors are considered by agency judges, whose rulings can be appealed to labor board members in Washington. From there, they can go to federal appeals court. The agency lacks authority to impose punitive damages or hold executives personally liable for wrongdoing, but can order companies to change policies, compensate and reinstate terminated workers, and negotiate with unions.\nA group of drivers in Illinois, hired through a different DSP, have also been organizing with the Teamsters this year. The Amazon Labor Union, which won a landmark unionization vote at a New York City warehouse in 2022 \u2014 but has so far been unable to bring Amazon to the bargaining table \u2014 also affiliated with the Teamsters this summer.\nWhile siding with the union on other issues, the NLRB regional director dismissed the Teamsters\u2019 claims that the company\u2019s decision to cut off business with the Southern California DSP constituted illegal retaliation.\nIn an emailed statement, Teamsters President Sean O\u2019Brien said the workers\u2019 activism in Palmdale, California, \u201chas paved the way for every other Amazon worker in the country to demand what they deserve and to get Amazon to the bargaining table.\u201d\n--With assistance from Spencer Soper.\n(Updates with comment from Amazon in the fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nFar-Right \u2018Terrorgram\u2019 Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks\nHong Kong\u2019s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City\u2019s Property Pain\nLosing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, but its stock fell more than 12% early Friday due to softer-than-anticipated guidance for the third quarter.\nThe e-commerce and cloud computing giant posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, beating the analyst estimate of $1.03.\nRevenue came in at $148.0 billion, slightly below the consensus estimate of $148.68 billion but up 10% YoY from $134.4 billion in the same quarter last year.\nAmazon's third-quarter revenue guidance of $154-158.5 billion fell short of analyst expectations of $158.2 billion, contributing to the stock's decline.\n\"We're continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\" said Andy Jassy, Amazon President&CEO, highlighting the company's cloud computing segment.\nIn addition, online sales and third-party seller performance fell short of consensus by 0.3% and 1.2%, respectively. Management noted that although volume remained strong, lower average selling prices (ASPs) offset gains.\n\"This trend existed for past year and looks to continue in Q3,\" Jefferies analysts commented.\nThis suggests that consumers are \"being very value-conscious,\" analysts added. \"While more are choosing to shop on Amazon, they are buying cheaper items and spending less on high-priced discretionary items.\"\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) reported sales of $26.3 billion for Q2, up 19% YoY, while the North America segment saw a 9% increase to $90.0 billion.

Industrial real estate investment trusts (REITs), which specialize in owning and managing warehouses, fulfillment centers and distribution hubs, are positioned to be the top beneficiaries of this trend \u2013 especially those that have e-commerce powerhouses like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) as their tenants.\nIn addition to their growth potential, REITs typically offer high dividend yields. Like all REITs, industrial REITs must distribute a significant portion of their income to shareholders as dividends.\nCheck It Out:\nDon\u2019t miss out on the next NVIDIA \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.**This is a paid advertisement.

Read them carefully before investing.\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. Get started investing in commercial real estate today.\nLet's look at three industrial REITs that name Amazon as one of their top tenants.\nAs of June 30, Stag Industrial (NYSE:STAG) owns and manages a portfolio of 573 industrial buildings across 41 states, containing over 114 million square feet. Amazon is Stag's largest tenant, with six leases that equate to approximately 2.8% of its annualized base rent. Other notable tenants include Coca-Cola, FedEx, Tempur Sealy and DHL.\nStag currently pays a monthly dividend of $0.123333 per share, which equates to an annualized dividend of $1.48 per share. At the time of this writing, its stock yields approximately 3.75%.\nIn addition to offering monthly income and a high yield, Stag offers dividend growth. It has raised its annual dividend payment every year since its initial public offering in 2011, resulting in 12 consecutive years of increases. Its 0.7% hike in January puts it on pace for 2024 to mark the 13th consecutive year with an increase.\nAs of June 30, Prologis Inc. (NYSE:PLD) owned ownership interests in more than 5,500 industrial properties worldwide, containing approximately 1.2 billion square feet, making it the largest REIT in the world. Amazon is Prologis' largest tenant, with about 45.7 million square feet leased, representing 5.1% of its net effective rent. Other notable tenants include Home Depot, FedEx, DHL and UPS.\nPrologis currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.96 per share, which equates to an annualized dividend of $3.84 per share. At the time of this writing, its stock yields approximately 3.1%.\nLike Stag, Prologis has consistently grown its dividend. It has raised its annual dividend payment each of the last 10 years and its 10% hike in February puts it on track for 2024 to mark the 11th consecutive year with an increase.\nRead More:\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.This is a paid advertisement.

With four leases, Amazon is EastGroup's largest tenant, representing approximately 1.8% of its annualized base rent. Other notable tenants include Starship Logistics, Trane and FedEx.\nEastGroup currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.27 per share, which equates to an annualized rate of $5.08 per share. At the time of this writing, its stock yields approximately 2.8%.\nWhile EastGroup may have the lowest yield of the stocks discussed in this article, it has the most impressive track record of dividend payments. It has paid dividends for 31 consecutive years with 28 increases and no reductions, including increases in the last 12 years.\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through REITs.\nArrived Homes, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform has launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. It paid 8.1% in July. The best part?

        "Title": "Amazon reports boost in quarterly profits but misses revenue estimates",
        "Author": "  HALELUYA HADERO ",
        "Text": "Amazon reported a boost in its quarterly profits Thursday, but the company missed revenue estimates, sending its stock lower in after-hours trading.\nThe Seattle-based tech company said it earned $13.5 billion for the April-June period, higher than the $10.99 billion industry analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated. Amazon earned $6.7 billion during the same period last year.\nEarnings per share for the second quarter came out to $1.26, higher than analysts' expectations of $1.03.\nHowever, investors reacted negatively to other results, leading Amazon shares to fall more than 6% after the closing bell. The company posted revenue of $148 billion, a 10% increase that fell slightly below analyst expectations of $148.67 billion.\nAmazon also said it expects revenue for the current quarter, which ends Sept. 30, to be between $154 billion and $158.5 billion \u2014 lower than the $158.22 billion forecast by analysts.\nAmazon boosted its spending during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep up with higher demand from consumers who became more reliant on online shopping. But as demand cooled and wider economic conditions pressured other parts of its business, the company aggressively cut costs by eliminating unprofitable businesses and laying off more than 27,000 corporate employees.\nThe cost-cutting has led to growth in profits. However, Amazon is also feeling the benefits of the buzz around generative artificial intelligence, which has helped reaccelerate its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, after it experienced a slowdown.\nThe company said Thursday that Amazon Web Services saw a 19% jump in revenue compared to the same period last year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement.\nThe cloud computing unit, whose customers are mostly businesses, has been attempting to lure in more customers with new tools, including a service called Amazon Bedrock that provides companies with access to AI models they can use to make their own applications. In April, Jassy said AWS was on pace for $100 billion in annual revenue.\nBut Amazon is also expected to spend more this year to support the unit. During a call with reporters, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said the company spent more than $30 billion during the first half of the year on capital expenditures, the majority of it to boost infrastructure for AWS. It expects that to increase during the second half, he said.\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads, Olsavsky said. Among other projects, the company plans to put billions toward additional infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Mississippi, where it has secured state incentives to build two data center \u201ccomplexes.\"\n\u201cThe key for us is always to make sure that we\u2019re matching that supply and demand, and running it efficiently so we don\u2019t have excess capacity,\" Olsavsky said. \"That\u2019s not a concern right now. Our concern is more on getting the supply.\u201d\nMeanwhile, revenue for the company\u2019s core e-commerce business grew by 5%, which was more sluggish compared to recent quarters. The numbers did not include sales from Amazon\u2019s annual Prime Day discount event, which took place last month.\nOlsavsky said the company came up short on revenue growth in North America because customers were still being cautious with their spending and trading down to cheaper items.\nAmazon said sales from its advertising business \u2014 which mostly comes from ad listings on its online platform \u2014 jumped by 20%. Earlier this year, it began placing ads on movies and TV shows found on its Prime Video service to bring in extra dollars.\nLast month, Prime Video also became one of three companies to sign an 11-year media rights deal with the National Basketball Association.\nBut the company faces other challenges.\nThis week, federal regulators said Amazon was responsible for the recall of more than 400,000 hazardous products that were sold on its platform by third-party sellers and shipped using its fulfillment service.\nAmazon is also facing an antitrust lawsuit, which alleges it has been overcharging sellers and stifling competition.\nAmazon\u2019s results followed other earning reports this week from tech giants such as Microsoft, Meta and Google\u2019s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.\n"

        "Text": "You may know Amazon as the retail giant that seems to sell everything. What you may not know is that Amazon offers many other ways to make some extra cash. According to Oberlo, nearly 2 million sellers actively use the massive online marketplace. Sellers don\u2019t even need to have their own products to bring in income.\nLearn More: How To Earn $750 a Week in Passive Income\nFind Out: 6 Unusual Ways To Make Extra Money (That Actually Work)\nAmazon offers simple and realistic money-making opportunities ranging from seasonal work, side gigs, remote work and ways to utilize special skills. Whether you want to start a third-party seller account or hit the road as a delivery driver, money-making opportunities at Amazon are abundant. If you\u2019re looking for a job change or a side hustle for extra cash, here are 17 ideas on how to make money on Amazon.\nSellers can use Amazon FBA to outsource the fulfillment of their sales. The process \u2014 recommended for high-volume sellers rather than those selling individual or handmade items \u2014 is straightforward. The seller sources items to offer for sale, often through wholesalers like Alibaba. These items can then be privately labeled with the seller\u2019s branding. The seller then ships the products to an Amazon fulfillment center and lists the products on Amazon. When an item is sold, it is shipped by Amazon directly to the buyer.\nAmazon charges $39.99 per month for a Professional Selling Account, and sellers using Amazon FBA pay additional storage and fulfillment fees. Despite this, there is good potential to make money through this program for sellers who can strike the right balance between their wholesale costs and fees and their upcharge on the retail price.\nCheck Out: 29 Best Games That Pay Real Money in 2024\nDiscover More: 4 Ways the Middle Class Can Make an Extra $500 a Week From Home\u00a0\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nSocial media can become another potential source of income through Amazon Influencers. Though this is an Amazon affiliate program, participants should not confuse this with Amazon Associates. It differs because Amazon Influencers use qualified social media accounts and their own Amazon storefront that showcases product recommendations. Influencers receive a commission on every product they sell.\nTo qualify, one must obtain a YouTube, Twitter, Instagram or Facebook account and apply. Amazon bases acceptance on the number of followers and other various engagement metrics.\nRead Next: I Rent Out a Home on Airbnb: Here\u2019s How Much Profit I Actually Bring In\nThe Amazon Business program helps sellers reach business-to-business customers. To sell through Amazon Business, sellers have to register a Professional Selling Account. Once they\u2019re signed up, sellers can create a business profile and list products, specifically targeting their business and products to the most suitable demographics. Sellers with diversity credentials or quality certifications can add those to their profiles, allowing them to reach businesses specifically trying to buy from sellers with their preferred credentials.\nThis program works for both high-volume and small-business sellers, offering quantity discounts and access to a virtual dashboard that gives insight into what products are selling best and to what type of buyer base. Business sellers who sign up for Amazon Business Prime (starting at $69 per month) receive additional benefits like cash back on a Business Prime credit card, free one-day business delivery and member-only deals and offers.\nThrough Amazon Associates, content creators, influencers or anyone with a large enough audience can earn up to 10% commission on sales made through the affiliate link on their platform. To be considered for Amazon Associates, creators must regularly publish original content on their own website. Affiliate marketers must also comply with Amazon\u2019s mobile application policy and be active on an approved social media website.\nProspective affiliate marketers must generate at least three sales within the first 180 days before their application is reviewed. Commission rates vary based on the specific program and the product category of the item.\nIf you have any skill with words, publishing a book through Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing, or KDP, can be an easy and low-effort route to a passive income stream.\nAuthors in the KDP program can list an electronic version of their book on Amazon in less than five minutes, and newly listed books are available to Kindle users in less than 48 hours. Amazon does not charge the author to list a book, and author royalties for Kindle sales can be as high as 70%. Through KDP, authors can maximize potential sales by using CreateSpace to make a physical copy of their book or ACX to make an audiobook. One drawback is that Amazon does not handle any marketing, so authors have to cultivate a reader base on their own.\nExplore More: I\u2019m an Investor: I\u2019m Making These Money Moves Immediately If Trump Wins\nAmazon can help those who want to launch a private-label brand. Through Amazon Accelerator, sellers can receive support, help with marketing and an avenue by which they can test products and receive feedback from customers. In exchange, entrepreneurs agree to market their products exclusively with Amazon.\nEntrepreneurs have launched a wide variety of products on Amazon Accelerator. Makers of electronics, furniture, clothing, snacks and other products all utilize the service.\nOne of the smartest ways to earn money online is by selling artisan products through Amazon Handmade. Sellers from over 80 countries utilize Amazon Handmade to sell handcrafted goods.\nProspective entrepreneurs are audited in a process to verify the authenticity of the products. Once approved, Amazon allows entrepreneurs to create a shop and list products at no charge. Sellers also receive a custom URL to make it easy for interested buyers to find a specific online shop. Amazon deducts a 15% referral fee for each sale made, but the remaining revenue goes to the artisan.\nSellers of custom merchandise also have a home on Amazon. Thanks to Merch by Amazon, customers can create, market and sell branded merchandise such as T-shirts, mugs or keychains.\nThe seller simply has to provide the artwork. After they choose the product type and color, Amazon takes care of production, sales, shipping and the Amazon product page. Sellers can also promote their products on blogs, social media or apps, and they receive a royalty for any items that sell.\nCheck Out: In 5 Years, These 2 Stocks Will Be More Valuable Than Apple\nThose who have built a reputation as trusted reviewers may want to consider Amazon Vine. Amazon invites reviewers to become Vine Voices based on a reviewer rank and the rating of the quality and helpfulness of their reviews.\nMoreover, Vine Voices may express their views freely. So long as the review meets Amazon\u2019s posting guidelines, the company will not edit a reviewer\u2019s posting. Although Vine Voices do not receive cash, Amazon provides Vine reviewers with free products from vendors.\nArbitrage involves buying a product from a retail store and selling it on Amazon at a markup. Sellers might purchase these products from a retailer such as Walmart or look to an online site such as eBay for products.\nSome might describe retail arbitrage as a form of Amazon FBA selling. However, it differs from standard online selling as it involves selling products with one-time availability. Moreover, given that anyone can sell this way, price competition could leave sellers with negligible profit margins. The key to successful retail arbitrage is knowing the market value of popular products and buying them for resale when they\u2019re on sale or at a deep discount.\nUnder limited circumstances, Amazon allows people to sell used electronics that they no longer want. Sellers can list eligible products and receive payment, but be aware certain restrictions do apply.\nThis does not apply to every product, and sellers will receive an Amazon gift card instead of cash. However, for those willing to sell under these conditions, it provides an opportunity to trade in unwanted merchandise for credit toward new purchases.\nRead More: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t Sell\nAmazon Home Services serves Amazon customers who need help with new products. Home Services provides a \u201cwhite glove\u201d service that helps customers with the assembly or installation of specific products and other customer service-related needs. Home theater services and appliance installation are examples of the services provided.\nAmazon Home Services sometimes closes this service to new applicants. However, interested providers can apply on Amazon\u2019s Professional Services website when positions become available.\nAmazon allows for crowdsourcing through Mechanical Turk, sometimes known as MTurk. MTurk enables businesses to outsource tasks to a virtual workforce. This allows businesses to hand off assignments on a pay-per-task model.\nThe companies themselves decide the pay rate, and the work often involves repetitive tasks such as data entry, data validation, surveys, research, and content moderation. However, it can serve as a source of extra money allowing workers to perform on their schedule.\nPeople may also earn money from Amazon by working directly for the company. One way is to become a delivery driver through Amazon Flex. Through Flex, drivers make Amazon deliveries on their schedules. They choose blocks of time on the Amazon Flex app and can adjust work times based on availability.\nThose 21 and older who have a valid driver\u2019s license, a smartphone such as Android or iPhone, a midsize or large vehicle and live in a city where Flex operates can become Flex drivers. Flex drivers earn between $18 and $25 per hour in most cases.\nFind Out: I\u2019m A Self-Made Millionaire: 6 Steps I Took To Become Rich On an Average Salary\nAmazon will pay you to work from home serving as a customer service associate. These associates come from 130 locations in over 40 countries, supporting customers while working from home.\nAssociates serve customers in 16 languages, and they help customers with services such as tracking packages, returns, assisting delivery drivers or supporting devices such as the Echo or Fire TV. Associates interact via phone, chat, mobile chat, email or Alexa, so they do not have to worry about a dress code.\nIn 2020, Amazon had nearly $470 billion in sales. Thus, it should come as no surprise that Amazon\u2019s fulfillment and distribution centers need help. There, workers help find, pack and ship goods for Amazon customers.\nWhile this lacks the flexibility of other Amazon-related income sources, the 22% sales growth the company experienced in 2021 should ensure that demand for workers will continue to grow. Salaries start at $15 per hour, and the job benefits can include healthcare coverage and parental leave.\nSince sales levels vary, particularly around the holidays, Amazon also needs seasonal workers. To this end, Amazon created CamperForce, seasonal work for those who live in RVs and travel the country.\nDuring such assignments, Amazon will include 401(k) coverage, 90 days of medical and prescription coverage, overtime pay and completion bonuses for those who stay until the end of the assignment. Amazon even offers provisions to cover campground expenses.\nExplore More: I Followed Mark Cuban\u2019s Genius Advice and Am on Track To Become a Millionaire\nThe bottom line is that If you\u2019re looking for ways to make money on Amazon, you\u2019ll be happy to know there are many options that all depend on your work preferences and schedule. Whether you want to make money on Amazon without selling a thing, boost your own e-commerce business or just passively earn income through an affiliate marketing program, it\u2019s good to know you could be a prime candidate to become part of a large and growing network of customers who trust and rely on Amazon.\nCaitlyn Moorhead, Monica White and Cynthia Bowman contributed to the reporting for this article.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n7 Reasons You Should Consider a Financial Advisor -- Even If You're Not Wealthy\nI'm an Economist: Here's My Prediction for Social Security If Trump Wins the 2024 Election\n3 Things to Do This Week If You Have Debt\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 17 Best Ways To Make Money on Amazon in 2024\n"

        "Author": "  Eduardo Baptista, Fanny Potkin and Karen Freifeld ",
        "Text": "By Eduardo Baptista, Fanny Potkin and Karen Freifeld\nBEIJING/SINGAPORE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - State-linked Chinese entities are using cloud services provided by Amazon or its rivals to access advanced U.S. chips and artificial intelligence capabilities that they cannot acquire otherwise, recent public tender documents showed.\nThe U.S. government has restricted the export of high-end AI chips to China over the past two years, citing the need to limit the Chinese military's capabilities.\nProviding access to such chips or advanced AI models through the cloud, however, is not a violation of U.S. regulations since only exports or transfers of a commodity, software or technology are regulated.\nA Reuters review of more than 50 tender documents posted over the past year on publicly available Chinese databases showed that at least 11 Chinese entities have sought access to restricted U.S. technologies or cloud services.\nAmong those, four explicitly named Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a cloud service provider, though they accessed the services through Chinese intermediary companies rather than from AWS directly.\nThe tender documents, which Reuters is the first to report on, show the breadth of strategies Chinese entities are employing to secure advanced computing power and access generative AI models. They also underscore how U.S. companies are capitalising on China's growing demand for computing power.\n\"AWS complies with all applicable U.S. laws, including trade laws, regarding the provision of AWS services inside and outside of China,\" a spokesperson for Amazon's cloud business said.\nAWS controls nearly a third of the global cloud infrastructure market, according to research firm Canalys. In China, AWS is the sixth-largest cloud service provider, according to research firm IDC.\nShenzhen University spent 200,000 yuan ($27,996) on an AWS account to gain access to cloud servers powered by Nvidia A100 and H100 chips for an unspecified project, according to a March tender document. It got this service via an intermediary, Yunda Technology Ltd Co, the document showed.\nExports to China of the two Nvidia chips, which are used to power large-language models (LLM) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, are banned by the U.S.\nShenzhen University and Yunda Technology did not respond to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment on Shenzhen University's spending or on any of the other Chinese entities' deals.\nZhejiang Lab, a research institute developing its own LLM, GeoGPT, said in a tender document in April that it intended to spend 184,000 yuan to purchase AWS cloud computing services as its AI model could not get enough computing power from homegrown Alibaba.\nA spokesperson for Zhejiang Lab said that it did not follow through with the purchase but did not respond to questions about the reasoning behind this decision or how it met its LLM's computing power requirements. Alibaba's cloud unit, Alicloud, did not respond to a request for comment.\nReuters could not establish whether or not the purchase went ahead.\nThe U.S. government is now trying to tighten regulations to restrict access through the cloud.\n\"This loophole has been a concern of mine for years, and we are long overdue to address it,\" Michael McCaul, chair of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, told Reuters in a statement, referring to the remote access of advanced U.S. computing through the cloud by foreign entities.\nLegislation was introduced in Congress in April to empower the commerce department to regulate remote access of U.S. technology, but it is not clear if and when it will be passed.\nA department spokesperson said it was working closely with Congress and \"seeking additional resources to strengthen our existing controls that restrict PRC companies from accessing advanced AI chips through remote access to cloud computing capability.\"\nThe commerce department also proposed a rule in January that would require U.S. cloud computing services to verify large AI model users and report to regulators when they use U.S. cloud computing services to train large AI models capable of \"malicious cyber-enabled activity\".\nThe rule, which has not been finalized, would also enable the commerce secretary to impose prohibitions on customers.\n\"We are aware the commerce department is considering new regulations, and we comply with all applicable laws in the countries in which we operate,\" the AWS spokesperson said.\nCLOUD DEMAND IN CHINA\nThe Chinese entities are also seeking access to Microsoft's cloud services.\nIn April, Sichuan University said in a tender document it was building a generative AI platform and purchasing 40 million Microsoft Azure OpenAI tokens to support the delivery of this project. The university's procurement document in May showed that Sichuan Province Xuedong Technology Co Ltd supplied the tokens.\nMicrosoft did not respond to requests for comment. Sichuan University and Sichuan Province Xuedong Technology did not respond to requests for comment on the purchase.\nOpenAI said in a statement its own services are not supported in China and that Azure OpenAI operates under Microsoft's policies. It did not comment on the tenders.\nThe University of Science and Technology of China's (USTC) Suzhou Institute of Advanced Research said in a tender document in March that it wanted to rent 500 cloud servers, each powered by eight Nvidia A100 chips, for an unspecified purpose.\nThe tender was fulfilled by Hefei Advanced Computing Center Operation Management Co Ltd, a procurement document showed in April, but the document did not name the cloud service provider and Reuters could not determine its identity.\nUSTC was added to a U.S. export control list known as the 'Entity List' in May for acquiring U.S. technology for quantum computing that could help China's military, and involvement in its nuclear program development.\nUSTC and Hefei Advanced Computing Center did not respond to requests for comment.\nBEYOND RESTRICTED AI CHIPS\nAmazon has offered Chinese organisations access not only to advanced AI chips but also to advanced AI models such as Anthropic's Claude which they cannot otherwise access, according to public posts, tenders and marketing materials reviewed by Reuters.\n\"Bedrock provides a selection of leading LLMs including prominent closed-source models such as Anthropic's Claude 3,\" Chu Ruisong, President of AWS Greater China, told a generative AI-themed conference in Shanghai in May, referring to its cloud platform.\nIn various Chinese-language posts for AWS developers and clients, Amazon highlighted the opportunity to try out \"world-class AI models\" and mentioned Chinese gaming firm Source Technology as one of its clients using Claude.\nAmazon has dedicated sales teams serving Chinese clients domestically and overseas, according to two former company executives.\nAfter Reuters contacted Amazon for comment, it updated dozens of posts on its Chinese-language channels with a note to say some of its services were not available in its China cloud regions. It also removed several promotional posts, including the one about Source Technology. Amazon did not give a reason for removing the posts and did not answer a Reuters query on that.\n\"Amazon Bedrock customers are subject to Anthropic's end user license agreement, which prohibits access to Claude in China both via Amazon's Bedrock API (application programming interface) and via Anthropic's own API,\" the AWS spokesperson said.\nAnthropic said it does not support or allow customers or end-users within China to access Claude.\n\"However, subsidiaries or product divisions of Chinese-headquartered companies may use Claude if the subsidiary itself is located in a supported region outside of China,\" an Anthropic spokesperson said.\nSource Technology did not respond to a request for comment.\n($1 = 7.1440 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Reporting by Eduardo Baptista, Fanny Potkin and Karen Freifeld; Additional reporting by Krystal Hu, Alexandra Alper and Beijing newsroom; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n"

        "Text": "Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) bagged regulatory permission in July to buy a 500-square-meter site in New Zealand for Project Kuiper.\nAmazon proposes to install and operate telecommunications equipment on the land to cater to its New Zealand customers, Bloomberg cites the Overseas Investment Office in Wellington.\nProject Kuiper is Amazon\u2019s initiative to develop a large-scale satellite broadband constellation that will provide reliable, affordable Internet service to underserved communities worldwide.\nThis project is part of a broader movement involving several companies planning to launch satellite constellations to offer global broadband internet coverage.\nAmazon\u2019s Project Kuiper aims to offer broadband internet from a constellation of more than 3,000 satellites in low Earth orbit, mirroring Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink.\nThe financial terms of the land acquisition were not disclosed.\nIt\u00a0aims to launch\u00a0its satellites before the end of 2024 and start the first customer tests in 2025, with a commercial service to follow later in the year. However, challenges loom in balancing affordability and service quality.\nIn June, Amazon\u2019s Project Kuiper collaborated with DIRECTV Latin America parent Vrio Corp to offer satellite broadband in seven South American countries.\nIn August, Amazon reported 10% second-quarter topline growth, reaching $148 billion but trailing the analyst consensus estimate of $148.56 billion.\nAmazon stock gained 27% in the last 12 months.\nWhen buying a stock for a longer time horizon, it is important for investors to assess where they think the stock is headed in the future.\nWhen mapping a stock's future trajectory, investors should consider factors including the future earnings expectations and expected performance against a benchmark.\nAmazon.com's revenue has grown at an average rate of 17.61% annually over the past 5 years. The average 1-year price target from analysts is $223.06, representing an expected 30.6% upside in 2025.\nWhile past performance is not a guarantee of future results, investors should also look at a stock's historical performance when compared to both a benchmark index and the company's peers. Shares of Amazon.com have seen an annualized return of -0.05%, underperforming the S&P500 index by 7.33%. This compares to 0.99% growth in the overall Consumer Discretionary sector.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Advertising Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other advertising stocks.\nWhen compared to the copy driven model of the late 1900s as popularized by shows such as Mad Men, the advertising era of 2024 is completely different. Today, advertisers have at their disposal the data of billions of people which they can characterize according to preference and target their ads to. This growth in digital advertising has been driven by the rise of video streaming platforms and digital publications, which continue to gain market share over paper newspapers.\nNowhere else is the impact of digital advertising in today's era clear as through the value of the world's largest search engine company. A mega cap stock, this firm has a market value of a whopping $2 trillion, making it one of the largest companies in the world in terms of market value. Yet, in another case of 2024 being a historic year of shifts for the technology industry as evidenced by technologies such as artificial intelligence, this firm is also facing the heat from the US government which might end up changing the very fabric of the industry.\nThe search engine giant, which earned $187 billion in trailing twelve month revenue from search and advertising, traces its roots back to the late 1990s when its founders created an algorithm called PageRank. This software determined which webpages were authoritative based on the amount and quality of backlinks they got, and as the engine grew, so did the firm's dominance in the global advertising industry as it processes more than 22 billion searches per day. However, this gravy train might be ending as a Washington judge ruled in August that its $26 billion in payments to other firms to make the platform the default option on their devices was an anti competitive behavior that locked others out in the industry.\nFollowing the ruling, there are rumors that the Justice Department might be considering breaking the company up by making it divest its mobile software and web browsing business divisions. However, any such decision will require court approval which will force the firm to comply. And while a court victory is great for news headlines, the US government has rarely broken up large companies in the modern era. The last such case was in 1982 through the breakup of the Bell System, and even if the browser and OS were made separate businesses, they are unlikely to survive on their own since both are provided to users for free.\nNot to mention, the long drawn nature of anti-trust action could take years, and end up being enforced when the industry is vastly different from what it is now. This is because artificial intelligence is gnawing at the heels of the industry, with products such as OpenAI's SearchGPT already in early stage releases. Speaking of AI, it's also making its mark on the advertising industry. Just as advertisers are able to rely on millions of users' data through search and social media platforms, AI helps them navigate through this data in novel and new ways.\nAs per McKinsey, marketing and sales could see a $931 billion productivity boost from AI through new features such as personalized campaigns and improved data use. These use cases have already become apparent, with the largest social media company in the world regularly sharing updates about how it is using AI to make advertisers' jobs easier on its platform. Two tools that it offers are the Advantage+ and Advantage+ Shopping platform which enables advertisers and sellers to automate their campaign operations and determine the best advertisements to run. The platforms also appear to be driving results, with the firm quoting a study that is \"demonstrating 22% higher return on ad spend for US advertisers after they adopted Advantage+ Shopping campaigns\" with revenue for the firm through the two AI platforms doubling annually during Q1 2024.\nSpeaking of revenue, the advertising industry's spending, which determines the fate of publishers is also determined by the state of the economy, consumer confidence, and advertisers' outlook. One such firm with brands in more than 100 companies shared during its Q2 2024 earnings call that while the advertising market is not at its best right now, it does appear to be recovering. This recovery is taking place in areas such as food and technology which joins strong performance in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and beauty care. Another publisher, which is one of the most well known digital media and lifestyle platforms in the world that relies on programmatic advertising (data driven user targeting through ads), saw its programmatic revenue grow by 3% annually during Q2 even as broader advertising revenue dropped by 19% annually.\nWith these details in mind let's take a look at which advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers. For stocks that are driving advertising technology, you should check out 8 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy Now.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the best advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers, we listed the NASDAQ and NYSE listings of an advertising ETF by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short and selected the stocks with the lowest percentage. An added 23 stocks after an internet search were also analyzed, but all these had market caps below $300 million so they were excluded.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nShort Interest as % of\u00a0 Shares Outstanding: 0.68%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the biggest eCommerce companies in the world, which also makes it a key player in the advertising industry. This is because Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s eCommerce site which attracted 3.25 billion users in June according to SemRush, creates a golden goose of users for large and small businesses to target. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) helps its sellers to run marketing campaigns through the Amazon Ads platform. Some features under this include cost per click (CPC) ads for sponsored brands, products, and displays. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also operates in the SaaS advertising industry through its AWS business which allows customers to run advanced marketing analytics and manage customer experiences. As a whole, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s hypothesis depends on its ability to optimize its fulfillment networks, increase same day deliveries, leverage AI in its business and in AWS product offerings, and the broader economic health.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.\"\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "With EPS Growth And More, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Makes An Interesting Case",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Amazon.com managed to grow EPS by 13% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. Amazon.com shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 3.4% to 9.0%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\nWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Amazon.com?\nSince Amazon.com has a market capitalisation of US$1.8t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$196b. Holders should find this level of insider commitment quite encouraging, since it would ensure that the leaders of the company would also experience their success, or failure, with the stock.\nIt means a lot to see insiders invested in the business, but shareholders may be wondering if remuneration policies are in their best interest. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Amazon.com, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.\nThe Amazon.com CEO received total compensation of just US$1.7m in the year to December 2023. That's clearly well below average, so at a glance that arrangement seems generous to shareholders and points to a modest remuneration culture. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.\nOne important encouraging feature of Amazon.com is that it is growing profits. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Amazon.com, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. Now, you could try to make up your mind on Amazon.com by focusing on just these factors, or you could also consider how its price-to-earnings ratio compares to other companies in its industry.\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Jeff Bezos\u2019 famed management rules are slowly unraveling inside Amazon. Can they survive the Andy Jassy era?",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "When Amazon ordered most workers back to the office three days a week in February 2023, Pamela Hayter was not happy about the end of a popular pandemic-era arrangement.\nBut Hayter, a program manager, was bothered on a deeper level: Because the policy effectively meant that only people living near an Amazon office would be able to continue working at the company, she believed Amazon was violating one of its sacred tenets to \"hire and develop the best.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, by announcing the mandate with little warning or buy-in, Hayter believed, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had betrayed his duty to \"earn trust,\" another important part of the Amazon code.\nAt Amazon these tenets, known as Leadership Principles, are much more than suggestions. They are a way of life that employees are judged on before they are even hired, steeped in from the moment they join, and scrupulously followed thereafter with the devotion of religious converts.\nHayter\u2019s next move was a case in point: With the help of some of the 30,000 other employees who joined an internal Slack channel she\u2019d created, she drafted a memo to lay out their concerns about the return-to-work mandate. The memo was exactly six pages long.\nLike the Leadership Principles, six-page memos (\"6-pagers,\" in Amazon lingo) are part of a unique work culture forged within the giant internet company over the years and considered as much of a contributor to Amazon\u2019s world-beating success as any blockbuster product or individual, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos himself.\nIn reality, these principles and the processes they produce are among Amazon\u2019s grandest innovations.\nThe customs and practices are widely imitated: More than a dozen books promise to teach managers the secrets to the principles and processes; consultants do brisk business helping firms import Amazon\u2019s methods into their organizations; CEOs load their emails with Amazonian axioms.\nAnd yet, as the Hayter episode shows, the Amazon Way is a fragile concept even within Amazon itself. Jassy defended the return-to-work decision as a judgment call; after all, another company leadership principle notes that \u201cleaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts.\u201d But the clash between employees and the CEO over who was being more faithful to the code reveals a growing tension that some fear could erode the pillars of the $2 trillion company.\nMore than three years after Bezos passed the CEO baton to Jassy, as Amazon recently celebrated its 30th birthday, the durability and staying power of Amazon\u2019s foundational work culture are being watched closely by many inside and outside the organization.\nFortune spoke to two dozen current and recently departed Amazon executives and managers about how the famous Amazon Way is holding up in the post-Bezos era. Many of those interviewed paint a picture of a company where the key principles and practices remain core but have become less universally agreed upon. Increasingly, some insiders say, the leadership principles have become weaponized, diluted, or applied inconsistently.\nPowerPoint presentations, once strictly verboten, now pop up occasionally. Longtime leaders who embodied the principles in their every move have moved on.\nPerhaps in response to some of these new realities, Amazon recently disseminated to employees an hourlong video course hosted by Jassy himself explaining the company\u2019s 16 leadership principles.\n\u201cThe leadership principles are not something that you just memorize or that you just study for a couple of hours, or you try once or twice and you\u2019ve got them,\u201d Jassy says in the intro. \u201cIt\u2019s something that you have to practice a lot.\u201d\nMargaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, said that the company regularly updates internal resources and training, including on topics pertaining to the company\u2019s culture. She said that Amazon\u2019s culture\u2014defined by the leadership principles, a \u201cwriting culture,\u201d and working backward from customers\u2019 needs\u2014remains strong: \u201cIt\u2019s what has driven innovations such as Prime, AWS, the Kindle, Alexa, the Climate Pledge, and Project Kuiper, just to name a few.\u201d\nThe success of these products, and Amazon\u2019s continued financial growth, indicate that the company is far from facing any immediate crisis. On Thursday, Amazon will report its second-quarter financial results, with Wall Street analysts expecting double-digit revenue and profit growth.\nAs Amazon seeks to extend its dominance into the next 30 years, however, the leadership principles and special work culture will almost certainly collide with the questions that have challenged so many corporate paragons of the past: Is having a sacred playbook an asset that companies should preserve at all costs, or does it become a liability holding companies back as the world around them changes? And, perhaps more important, is there a point at which a company\u2019s size, growth, and industry-spanning tentacles make a unified culture of decision-making and inventing impossible?\nCustomer obsession.\nBias for action.\nDisagree and commit.\nThere are 16 Leadership Principles at Amazon. Any Amazon employee can recite most of them by heart (those who can\u2019t won\u2019t last very long).\nThere are also the various homegrown Amazon practices: the two-pizza rule, which holds that cross-functional, or \u201csingle-threaded,\u201d teams focused on a specific goal or project should be lean enough that two pies could suffice as a team meal. There\u2019s also a rabid attention on so-called \u201cinput\u201d metrics of a certain business\u2014think selection or price\u2014rather than output metrics such as revenue.\nAnd then there\u2019s the intense focus on written narratives, including the 6-pager, a planning document that describes in storylike fashion a goal for a business line and how to go about accomplishing it, or a new project or plan (one variant of the 6-pager is the so-called PRFAQ, written in the style of a press release announcing the hypothetical future product, and the focal point of Amazon\u2019s \u201cWorking Backward\u201d product-development approach). Before a key meeting, every single attendee sits silently and reads the memo to themself. Only then is a discussion permitted to begin in earnest.\nIt sounds almost cultlike, Amazon insiders acknowledge. But as former Amazon Prime Video boss Bill Carr notes, the payoff is that historically Amazon employees up and down the corporate ladder understand things at a \u201cgranular level.\u201d\n\u201cThe executives at Amazon are just so much more well-informed about what is going on in their company, in terms of metrics, in terms of the initiatives that teams are doing, in terms of what's working, what's not working,\u201d said Carr, who left in 2015 but is the coauthor of the book Working Backwards and cofounder of a consulting firm by the same name, which both aim to guide business leaders on how to apply Amazon\u2019s principles and practices to their own businesses.\nExecutives at Amazon brim with personal examples of the power of the leadership mottos. Ideally, multiple principles can mesh together on a project to help unleash a single breakthrough product or service.\nBeryl Tomay, a 19-year Amazon veteran and vice president of its transportation division, points to one recent success story that involved \u201cregionalizing\u201d the company\u2019s network of U.S. warehouses so that each facility serves a distinct geographic area. The multiyear project has lowered costs, led to more environmentally friendly trucking routes, and allowed customers to get their goods faster, the company has said.\nFrom brainstorming the initial idea to executing, the project called for a collection of Leadership Principles\u2014 from \u201ccustomer obsession\u201d to \u201cthinking big.\u201d Tomay reels off more of them with the zeal of a true believer: \u201cThere\u2019s a 'simplify' part [and] there's also the 'invent' part. 'Dive deep' too. Going super deep into what our topology looks like, and what our inbound inventory placement looks like.\u201d\nIf mission statements and corporate values are viewed as empty slogans within many companies, at Amazon the Leadership Principles and special practices are embraced with genuine sincerity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s critically important for an organization to have something like this if they are actually meaningful,\u201d said Stephan Meier, chair of the management division at Columbia Business School and author of the forthcoming book The Employee Advantage.\nBut, Meier adds, \u201cif it's not lived, if it's not on top of people\u2019s minds, if it doesn't have any implications of how you would make decisions or treat each other, they are completely meaningless.\u201d\nIt\u2019s precisely this warning that made some Amazon insiders uneasy with what happened a few years ago.\nOn July 1, 2021, Amazon did something it hadn\u2019t done in many years: It added two new leadership principles to its list. \u201cStrive to be Earth\u2019s best employer\u201d was one new principle. \u201cSuccess and scale bring broad responsibility\u201d was the other.\nWhen these were introduced, Amazon was facing intense media coverage over the swell of unionization efforts in its warehouse network, as well as antitrust and environmental scrutiny. And with Bezos scheduled to hand over the CEO reins a few days later, the introduction of the two new principles served as a convenient opportunity to demonstrate a company committed to progress under his successor.\nInside the company, though, the reaction among many employees was swift and brutal: \u201cThey are clearly a marketing ploy and they devalue the rest of the Leadership Principles,\u201d one former senior manager of more than 10 years who left the company recently told Fortune. \u201cTotal bullshit,\u201d opined a former longtime communications employee at Amazon who was still at the company at the time, and who summed up the new principles as \u201cplaying the reputational game versus guiding how you think.\u201d\nThe problem, explained a former Amazon vice president, is that the pair of new leadership principles are so radically different from the other 14 that it makes it tougher for employees to grasp the essence of the overall principles and to act on them. \u201cI've got to think that that\u2019s somewhat challenging for the rank and file. The fact that there are so many LPs, and the fact that these last two are so abstract,\u201d the former VP said.\nThe expansion of the number of principles has coincided with what some Amazon insiders describe as an erosion of trust in the principles, or at least in the way their colleagues understand and apply the principles, which are meant to influence everything from new-product ideation to employee evaluations.\nSeveral longtime managers told Fortune that they felt the overall intent of the leadership principles has now shifted in many situations from guidelines on how to make the right decision, to more punitive usages that come across mainly intended to point out flaws. Such weaponization of leadership rules to criticize or squash dissent has always been a reality to a certain extent. \u201cEarns trust\u201d has been especially problematic in this regard, according to some women of color, and a former Amazon VP has written about leadership principles being weaponized by leaders when \u201cthey lack the power to give orders\u201d and thus resort to \u201ca crude attempt to apply the LP not as intended, but as a way to ensure an outcome.\u201d\nEven knowing that, many who spoke to Fortune believe the issue has worsened in recent years as Amazon has hired many executives from outside the company. (Most of those who spoke to Fortune requested anonymity, either because they are not permitted to talk to the press without permission as current Amazon employees, or because they feared retaliation for speaking candidly even as former employees.) One current Amazon senior manager said they\u2019ve consistently observed bosses new to the company use the principles \u201cas weapons to put those who aren\u2019t favorites in their place,\u201d while employing other principles to build up their favorites.\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll hear, \u2018It\u2019s amazing you had this \u2018bias for action\u2019\u2026and other times when I believe I\u2019ve had \u2018bias for action,\u2019 they will say you weren't data-driven (from the leadership principle \u2018Dive deep\u2019) enough.\u201d\nAnother employee, a longtime AWS manager, said his superiors over the last few years frequently wielded \u201cDisagree and commit\u201d\u2014a maxim intended to prevent groupthink during project planning while ensuring unity once a plan has been agreed upon\u2014as a cudgel to quash any level of pushback.\n\u201cThe joke by the time I left [last year] was if you didn't like something, you could disagree and commit or disagree and quit,\u201d the employee said.\nCallahan, the Amazon spokesperson, said that the two new principles are as important as the others, and that they all play a role in evaluating new hires as well as the performance of current employees.\nBut there are other signs of change within the organization too. Several current managers who spoke to Fortune said that PowerPoint presentations have supplanted written narratives in some cases over the last two years\u2014not in a dominant way, but in a noticeable one nonetheless. In the Prime Video division, for example, new executives who have come to the company after long careers outside of Amazon have been known to chafe at the heavy focus on narratives.\n\u201cThere's a lot of resistance from outsiders at the executive level,\u201d one current manager said.\nAnother senior manager who worked at Amazon for 15 years said his first 13 years at the company were marked by an overwhelming amount of writing, but that in the last two years that has shifted to PowerPoint decks.\n\u201cWe have this S team that is very religious about Amazon\u2019s culture and gets it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they brought in an enormous amount of senior execs in the level or two below the S team from [other] companies and they brought in their culture and were never given a real, \u2018This is how we do things at Amazon.\u2019\u201d\nNew executives who joined right before or immediately after COVID-19 shutdowns also struggled to grasp the supreme importance of business review documents like the weekly, monthly, and quarterly business reviews that exist elsewhere in the business world but are foundational inside Amazon.\n\u201cThere's huge value in the QBR when everyone sits together and puts everything on the table,\u201d a former director-level executive who left Amazon last year said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re doing it over video and have to limit the number of attendees because there\u2019s too many people, and you\u2019re really worried about anything in there that\u2019s too sensitive to be leaked, then the QBR becomes an onerous burden.\u201d\nSome ascribe the fraying of Amazon\u2019s distinct work culture in part to the change in the CEO suite, even while acknowledging Bezos\u2019s wandering focus in this area during the final years of his tenure.\n\u201cIn the last two years, Andy should have been more attuned to this,\u201d one current Amazon manager who has spent 15 years at the company said in an interview.\nAs chief executive, Bezos for many years served as the guiding light of the Amazon Way, providing real-time lessons in how to interpret the leadership principles in different situations and how to know which ones to employ when.\nThe modeling was crucial for a set of principles which, as everyone who spoke to Fortune agreed, are often in tension with one another. How can you both \u201cdive deep\u201d while having a \u201cbias for action\u201d? How can you truly employ \u201ccustomer obsession\u201d if you also have to make sure that \u201cfrugality\u201d is core to what you do?\nBezos excelled at explaining the mental models or logic he used to arrive at a decision, says Carr. He was able to articulate the \u201cwhy\u201d as much as the \u201cwhat.\u201d\n\u201cJeff\u2019s brain just doesn\u2019t work like other people\u2019s brains,\u201d adds Carr, who experienced 15 years of firsthand observations before leaving the company in 2015, and who stressed that he could only speak about Amazon\u2019s culture as it was during his time at the company. \u201cBy learning from him, then you could start to take those paths, too, and teach people about why that\u2019s the path we would take.\u201d\nThat would be a tough act for anyone to follow, even a 27-year veteran like Jassy who once served as Bezos\u2019s \u201cshadow,\u201d a role similar to a chief of staff. That\u2019s why many who spoke to Fortune don\u2019t point to the Bezos-Jassy transition as the main fault line. The disruption caused by the pandemic, as well as the doubling of Amazon\u2019s headcount in two years, was more to blame, they say.\nThose who joined right before the pandemic, or during the madness of 2020 and 2021, had little time to learn and adapt. Learning through meeting interactions over videoconferencing, for example, was much less conducive to osmosis than in-person interactions, either planned or serendipitous run-ins, several sources said.\n\u201cThe leadership we brought in from 2019 to 2021 at the director level and above never really were educated on the Amazon culture,\u201d a senior manager of 15 years said.\n\u201cThey really struggled to understand the culture, but that wasn\u2019t on them,\u201d said another, an Amazon director-level executive who left the company recently after nearly a decade. \u201cThat\u2019s on the changing of times and remote work.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s Callahan said that for the last five years, new senior Amazon leaders at the director and vice president levels attend a three-day training on the company\u2019s culture taught by peers, and are paired with other Amazon colleagues to help them adapt to the company in other ways. However, Callahan declined to respond to questions about whether this practice was put on hold during the pandemic and, if so, for how long.\nMany longtime standard-bearers of the company\u2019s DNA have also walked away in recent years. Jeff Wilke, Bezos\u2019s longtime right hand and the CEO of Amazon\u2019s core consumer business, left in 2021; Dave Clark, a longtime head of Amazon\u2019s warehouse and delivery operations who eventually replaced Wilke, departed Amazon a little more than a year later, reportedly in part due to Jassy\u2019s hands-on managing style.\n\u201cCulture takes active architecture and work,\u201d said another former Amazon vice president who worked at the company for more than 15 years. \u201cThere was nobody else left to teach [that],\u201d the former exec added, in a nod to all the top leaders who have left the company.\nWith so much change at the top, executives like Jamil Ghani are trying to step up. The global leader of Amazon Prime joined the company eight years ago and says that providing on-the-fly lessons and guidance about the leadership principles and Amazon customs, like written narratives, is an important part of his job.\n\u201cI often tell the team that the point of your work is not the doc; that the point of your work is to create a doc that can inspire the right meeting, the right discussion,\u201d Ghani told Fortune. \u201cIn the best meetings, you actually don't even talk about the document. Everybody has the same context and information and then you have a discussion.\"\nIn the event that a leadership principle has been misinterpreted or misapplied\u2014including, as he acknowledges occasionally occurs, in situations when one is being used punitively\u2014Ghani swoops in.\n\u201cI've done this many times when it's happened or, offline, kind of follow up with a peer or somebody else and be like, 'Hey, I don't think that's quite right. And here's why,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cAnd people can have a very level-headed conversation about it.\u201d\nOne of the beauties of Amazon\u2019s leadership principles has long been that they are detailed enough to serve as North Stars but broad enough for leaders to mold them as necessary depending on the type of decision or current environment.\n\u201cThese are not processes that give you the answers,\u201d says Carr, the former head of Prime Video. \u201cThey don't tell you what to do. They don't tell you whether to turn left or turn right, or to green-light this thing or not that thing. They\u2019re management tools that give you the right frameworks to use to examine the problem.\u201d\n\u201cThink of the LPs like the Bible,\u201d a former member of Amazon\u2019s exclusive senior executive team, known as the S-team, told Fortune. \u201cAmazing how many religions are based off the same text.\u201d\nThree years into Jassy\u2019s CEO tenure, the changes are becoming increasingly clear. The question now is whether this is evidence that the magic formula is getting diluted or a sign of the framework\u2019s versatility.\nTomay, the VP of transportation, says staying nimble sometimes requires tweaking longtime practices. In the last year, she\u2019s told her teams to reserve the six-page memo for only the most important meetings and encouraged them to craft a one-pager first. If there\u2019s an alignment on the path forward after reviewing the one-pager in, say, a 30-minute meeting, that person or team will get the green light to go off and dive deep in creating a 6-pager.\n\u201cThe company has shifted and grown,\u201d she says, \u201cso you have to keep adapting.\u201d\nWith 1.5 million employees, Amazon is one of the largest employers in the world. And it has successfully expanded into lucrative markets like cloud computing, advertising, and entertainment. But with online retailers like China\u2019s Shein and Temu gaining momentum, and AI threatening to reshape the entire business landscape, Amazon\u2019s ability to adapt without losing what makes it special are sure to be tested in the years to come.\nBusiness history can provide some unifying lessons. One key one: a strong culture and DNA, anchored in principles and practices that are talked about and lived out most working days, can help stabilize\u2014even bolster\u2014an organization during periods of significant change, whether CEO transitions or massive shifts in consumer or enterprise trends.\nMeier, the Columbia Business School professor and author, points to Toyota as one legacy corporation worth studying in this regard. \u201cToyota had those very clear principles on how to treat employees and make decisions, and I think it served them really well,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a result, they sustained some of their success over transitions.\u201d\nThe auto giant, whose stock hit an all-time high in March, is 87 years old, almost three times older than Amazon.\nIt\u2019s currently on its 12th president.\nAre you a current or former Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "Title": "Should Investors Buy the Dip in Amazon Stock After Shares Slide on Revenue Miss?",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "August may have just begun, but it has already been a tough month for Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shareholders. The stock initially sank after the e-commerce giant missed analyst revenue estimates when it reported its Q2 results.\nMeanwhile, the stock has continued to drift lower, caught in the global market sell-off. A small interest rate hike in Japan and the unwinding of the carry trade appears to be one reason behind the market's recent weakness.\nLet's take a closer look at Amazon's most recent results to see if the sell-off is a good opportunity to buy the stock.\nWhen it comes to earnings, how a stock reacts is often linked to the expectations going into the results. If a company falls short of analyst estimates for a key metric or issues guidance below analyst expectations, the stock will often feel some near-term pressure.\nWhile Amazon posted solid 10% revenue growth in its second quarter, its $148 billion in sales fell short of analyst expectations for revenue of $148.6 billion. Meanwhile, it forecast that its third-quarter sales would grow by 8% to 11% to between $154 billion and $158.5 billion. However, the $156.4 million midpoint of that range was shy of the $158.2 million analyst consensus.\nThe company's cloud computing segment, AWS, led the way with revenue growth of 19% to $26.3 billion. AWS' operating income, meanwhile, soared 72% from $5.4 billion to $9.3 billion.\nNorth American sales climbed 10% to $90 billion, while international sales rose 7% to $31.7 billion. Advertising services led the way with 20% revenue growth to $12.8 billion. The company is upbeat about the prospects of incorporating advertising into its Prime Video service and it just inked an 11-year deal with the NBA to broadcast live games. Subscription service revenue, meanwhile, grew 11% to $10.9 billion.\nThird-party seller services revenue jumped 13% to $36.2 billion. Online stores only saw 6% sales growth to $55.4 billion, while physical stores saw sales grow 4% to $5.2 billion.\nLike its cloud computing competitors, Amazon plans to spend heavily to continue to build out the infrastructure needed to support increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) as well as non-AI workloads. As a result, its second-half capital expenditures (capex) will be higher than in the first half.\nAmazon also continues to promote its new AI chips, Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference, which will have next-generation versions coming out later this year. According to management, there is a lot of demand for the chips given their price performance.\nAmazon has a number of strong opportunities in front of it. First and foremost is AI, and the company is attacking this opportunity on several levels from cloud computing, to its own AI chips, to offering large language model (LLM) services.\nAdvertising is another big opportunity, and this area showed strong growth in the second quarter. Sponsored product ads are currently Amazon's biggest source of ad revenue, but it will begin bringing more advertising to its Prime Video service as well. Meanwhile, its deal with the NBA will undoubtedly bring in a lot of interest and ad dollars to its streaming service.\nOne knock against Amazon is its valuation. The stock currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of nearly 28 based on 2025 analyst estimates. While that is down from historical P/E levels, revenue growth at the company has slowed down over the years.\nGiven its revenue growth and gross margin profile, I would consider Amazon's current valuation a bit on the high side. Amazon's gross margins are much lower than that of a software company. For example, Microsoft\u00a0has gross margins near 70%, while Amazon's are under 50%, and around 31% when including fulfillment costs.\nWith the recent overall market weakness, I'd most likely take a small starter position in Amazon given the opportunities in front of it, while looking to add more if it continues to sell off and its valuation becomes more attractive.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned -16.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has lost 12.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.19 per share, indicating a change of +40% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +59.7%. This estimate has changed +1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.87 indicates a change of +26.8% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Amazon, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $156.83 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $635.77 billion and $705.37 billion estimates indicate +10.6% and +11% changes, respectively.\nAmazon reported revenues of $147.98 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.1%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $0.63 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.44%. The EPS surprise was +17.14%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Jody Godoy ",
        "Text": "By Jody Godoy\n(Reuters) - An appeals court in Washington, D.C. revived the district's lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc on Thursday, saying it plausibly claimed the online retailer's pricing policies illegally stifle competition.\nThe District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed a ruling that had dismissed the lawsuit, which accuses Amazon of harming competition through restrictions on its suppliers and third-party sellers on Amazon.com.\nAmazon is currently seeking dismissal of another case involving similar claims by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and more than a dozen states.\nAmazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said the company disagrees with the appeals court ruling and looks forward to proving its policies benefit consumers.\n\"Just like any store owner who wouldn\u2019t want to promote a bad deal to their customers, we don\u2019t highlight or promote offers that are not competitively priced,\" he said.\nD.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb welcomed the court's ruling in a statement.\n\"We will continue fighting to stop Amazon\u2019s unfair and unlawful practices that have raised prices for District consumers and stifled innovation and choice across online retail,\" he said.\nD.C. sued Amazon in May 2021 claiming Amazon effectively bans third party sellers from offering products for less elsewhere by refusing to highlight their listings if they do.\nThe lawsuit also claims Amazon has agreements with wholesalers that guarantee it a minimum profit. As a result, the complaint alleges, if Amazon lowers a price to compete with another online seller, the wholesaler must pay Amazon the difference between the price it sells at and the agreed minimum. These payments are a disincentive for wholesalers to lower prices to compete, the complaint said.\nThe D.C. appeals court said on Thursday the judge who dismissed the case in May 2023 set the bar too high, and the attorney general had a plausible claim the practices harmed competition in the online retail marketplace.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Chris Reese)\n"

        "Author": "  Deborah Mary Sophia ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com (AMZN) is expected to join Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) on Thursday in reporting a surge in capital spending on artificial intelligence as Big Tech companies rush to capitalize on the booming technology.\nAmazon's stock price was up over 1% before the bell and ahead of its earnings release.\nThe e-commerce giant's capital investments - mostly for building cloud and generative AI infrastructure - is expected to have risen 43% in the second quarter to $16.41 billion, according to LSEG data. That represents a roughly $1.5 billion increase from the previous three months.\nThe steep spending is also expected to pressure Amazon's margins, outweighing benefits from cost cuts and supply chain efficiencies that are aiding the retail unit's profitability.\nThe company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has long dominated the cloud-computing market but it has been facing tough competition from Microsoft in recent quarters after the Windows maker rolled out AI-powered services to its Azure cloud business.\nIn response, Amazon has partnered with the likes of Anthropic and offered startups free credits that cover the cost of using major AI models to boost the market share of its AI platform Bedrock. It also named a new head for the AWS unit in May.\nMicrosoft and Google-parent Alphabet also said earlier this month they would plow ahead with investments even as the payoff from AI takes longer than some investors had hoped. This knocked Big Tech stocks whose valuations have soared this year on the promise of AI.\n\"Amazon's capex spend will certainly be scrutinized closely. It has been slow on the adoption of AI and is skewed towards smaller companies which have struggled in the high interest-rate environment,\" said Ben Barringer, analyst at Quilter Cheviot.\n\"We would expect AWS to start speeding things up in its AI development going forward.\"\nAmazon shares have risen about 23% this year. The stock has shed more than 6% since July 8, when it hit a record, part of a broader market selloff led by US megacaps.\nGrowth at AWS is likely to have stayed similar to the previous quarter at just over 17%, according to LSEG data.\nBut Morgan Stanley analysts said: \"AWS needs to grow 18%+ in order to ... ensure investors of AWS's (AI) positioning and its ability to generate high-teens growth through this heavy capex investment period.\"\nAs a result of the spending increase, Amazon's gross profit margin growth is expected to have slowed to 1.3% in the April-June quarter, compared with 2.6% in the previous quarter and an average of 2.7% over the past two years.\nGrowth in its North American retail business likely slowed to 8% between April and June, from 12.3% in the January-March quarter, amid signs of a wider slowdown in consumer spending and some competition from new and fast-growing Chinese players such as Temu and Tiktok Shop that are enticing more US shoppers.\nAmazon's total revenue is expected to have grown 10.6% to $148.56 billion - the slowest rise in five quarters.\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Devika Syamnath)\n"

        "Author": "  Sasha Rogelberg ",
        "Text": "As retailers crack down on in-store theft, Amazon has emerged an unlikely victor. Tired of navigating locked-up cases filled with essentials, shoppers are looking for ease\u2014and finding it on Amazon, CEO Andy Jassy said.\n\u201cIt's a pretty tough experience with how much is locked behind cabinets, where you have to press a button to get somebody to come out and open the cabinets for you, and a lot of shop lifting going on in the stores,\u201d he said during the company\u2019s earnings call late Thursday. \u201cSo the combination of what's happening in the physical world and how much improved we've made our [expanded Amazon Pharmacy] experience is driving a lot of customer resonance and buying behavior.\u201d\nJassy did not provide sales data for the company\u2019s pharmacy platform but said there's \u201ca lot of growth there.\u201d Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThough Amazon Pharmacy is a small slice of the company\u2019s online platform, the comments highlight Amazon\u2019s effort\u2019s to decrease friction\u2014implementing technologies to make shopping easier while simultaneously mitigating retail shrink, or inventory loss\u2014amid growing frustration over anti-theft measures.\nAnti-theft technologies have already dissuaded consumers from shopping at certain retailers. Joe Budano, CEO of anti-theft technology company Indyme, told Axios that frustration with locked-up goods and other shoplifting deterrents can lead to sales decreases of 15% to 25%.\nThe increase in anti-theft measures has emerged along with grievances from retail CEOs on the prevalence of shoplifting, which they said could lead to store closures and higher prices. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in December 2022, \u201cTheft is an issue. It\u2019s higher than what it has historically been.\u201d\nIronically, some of the products stolen from brick-and-mortar retailers have found their way to online platforms like Amazon for resale. Amazon said in a June blog post it\u2019s invested in and \u201cleverages sophisticated detection and prevention solutions across our stores\u201d to combat the sale of stolen items.\nAs retailers introduce additional technology to reduce retail theft, experts are conflicted on the actual scope of the problem. Data about the prevalence and impact of retail theft is mixed: The Council on Criminal Justice\u2019s 2023 shoplifting report, which used data from the first half of the year, found that shoplifting surged 16% from the first half of 2019.\nYet shoplifting was down in 17 of 24 U.S. cities where data was collected. And after New York was removed as an outlier, rates in the first half of 2023 were lower than the same period in 2019. It\u2019s led retail experts to say that the threat of shoplifting to retailers\u2019 bottom lines has been blown out of proportion.\nInstead, trying to prevent shoplifting has become its own threat to retailers. Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at GlobalData, told Bloomberg that as long as retailers continue the practice of locking up items, it jeopardizes an advantage of brick-and-mortar stores, namely their ability to help develop closer relationships with consumers.\nFor the consumer, it means retail therapy has turned into a retail nightmare. Some shoppers have been outspoken about not only the scope of the problem in their own shopping experiences, but also about how it's driven to them online shopping instead.\n\u201cI recognize there is a reason why those things have been put in place, but it just makes me not want to patronize that store,\u201d a Philadelphia business owner, who visits stores in-person to compare products, told the Inquirer. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to lose that experience anyway, I\u2019m just going to shop online.\u201d\nOne Los Angeles Target shopper recalled waiting 15 minutes for a store worker to unlock a shelf case. She\u2019s increasingly looked for essentials on Amazon.\n\u201cRather than go to Target and wait,\u201d she told the Los Angeles Times, \u201cI\u2019ll just give Daddy Bezos my hard-earned cash.\u201d\nTarget didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Election headlines have been coming so fast and furious that they\u2019re drawing consumers\u2019 attention away from shopping at a time the industry is already vulnerable because of a hit to discretionary spending.\nThat\u2019s the early indication from retail giants this earnings season.\nEtsy, for one, pulled its fourth quarter forecast because the macro environment is unpredictable, CEO Josh Silverman told Yahoo Finance.\n\u201cWe have an election that\u2019s been incredibly mindshare-consuming, and I expect, unfortunately, that that\u2019s going to get worse. And the macro continues to be very volatile,\u201d Silverman said.\nEtsy stock fell more than 7% after the online marketplace reported second quarter net income that missed estimates and said gross merchandise sales \u2014 the total value of goods sold through the platform \u2014 would fall in the low-single-digit range this quarter.\nAmazon, for its part, reported online sales rose 4.6% last quarter, slightly shy of estimates, and cited a \u201ccautious consumer.\u201d CFO Brian Olsavsky said the news cycle has been an additional factor.\n\u201cWhen high-profile things happen, or the assassination attempt a couple of weeks ago, you see that people shift their attention to news. It\u2019s more about distractions,\u201d he told reporters on a media call.\nWhile e-commerce companies like Etsy and Amazon have already reported, traditional retail earnings don\u2019t pick up until about the third week of August. One early bricks-and-mortar indication came from Tractor Supply (TSCO). Executives on its earnings call said that elections don't usually cause much change in performance \u2014 but that this upcoming election will make its fourth quarter tough to predict.\nAnalysts agree that the backdrop is challenging.\nNick Jones, managing director of internet equity research at Citizens JMP, said it\u2019s difficult to quantify the effect of the news cycle and political developments specifically, but the general environment is weighing on spending.\n\u201cThe macro is absolutely dominating the market, and absolutely dominating people\u2019s conversations,\u201d Simeon Siegel of BMO Capital Markets said in a phone interview. He\u2019s a managing director and senior analyst covering retail and e-commerce, and said election news is just one element contributing to shoppers\u2019 sentiment, in addition to unemployment, residual inflation, and geopolitics.\nBoth analysts said that spending won\u2019t come to a halt and there\u2019s still room for outperformance.\n\u201cI think people will be distracted for sure, but people will still consume. If emotions are inflamed, people might opt for the more comfortable experience,\u201d Jones said. That could mean sticking with reliable giants like Amazon.\nBecause distracted or distressed consumers are being more choosy, retailers have to work harder, Siegel said. \u201cCompanies aren\u2019t being gifted revenues, they need to fight and earn them. Simply being, and simply being large, is not the path to winning,\u201d he said. They need to offer \u201ccompelling product or experience or value.\u201d\nHome Depot kicks off retail earnings on Aug. 13, and things heat up the following week with results from TJX (TJX), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Macy\u2019s (M), and Gap (GPS).\nJulie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance's Market Domination and Market Domination: Overtime.

        "Title": "Amazon Sent a Big Warning to Nvidia Shareholders. Is the AI Stock in Trouble?",
        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have surged 145% over the past year due to the semiconductor company's critical position in the artificial intelligence (AI) economy. Specifically, Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUS) are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like training machine learning models and running artificial intelligence applications.\nEarlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported, \"Nvidia's chips underpin all of the most advanced AI systems, giving the company a market share estimated at more than 80%.\" Some analysts believe Nvidia controls as much as 95% of the AI chip market. But Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) recently issued a warning for Nvidia shareholders.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy recently told analysts no single artificial intelligence chip will fit every use case, simply because companies and developers want optionality. \"You saw this several years ago when some companies tried to argue that TensorFlow will be the only machine learning framework that mattered, and then PyTorch and others overtook it,\" Jassy explained.\nNvidia consistently sets performance records at the MLPerf benchmarks, objective tests that measure how well AI systems perform training and inference tasks. But Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are also very expensive. Its H200 GPUs cost up to $40,000 each, and full server racks cost millions of dollars. Jassy believes there is robust demand for products between the two extremes, so Amazon is developing custom AI silicon.\n\"We have a deep partnership with Nvidia and the broadest selection of Nvidia instances available, but we've heard loud and clear from customers that they relish better price performance,\" Jassy told analysts. \"It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon. Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference.\"\nImportantly, Amazon has previous experience in developing custom chips. The company has been designing generalized central processing units (CPUs) called Graviton processors for several years. Those chips are based on Arm architecture, and they offer 30% to 40% better price performance versus the leading x86 processors from AMD and Intel, according to Jassy.\nAmazon has the same goal with its custom AI silicon. Trainium and Inferentia are not meant to challenge Nvidia GPUs on performance alone, but rather to provide customers with a cost-efficient alternative. Some companies would rather pay a premium for the fastest AI chips, but others would gladly use slower chips to save money.\nAmazon is not the only company that is designing custom silicon. Broadcom develops custom AI chips for Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms, and it won a third major customer earlier this year. The company has not named the customer, but Reuters identified it as TikTok parent ByteDance. Additionally, J.P. Morgan\u00a0analysts recently speculated that Broadcom has also secured a contract to build custom AI chips for OpenAI, bringing its total to four major customers.\nJoseph Moore at Morgan Stanley expects that trend to continue. \"Hyperscalers, including Amazon, Google, and Meta, use custom silicon for their data centers due to cost and energy constraints in AI computing. As hyperscalers continue to invest in AI infrastructure, we expect increased demand for energy-efficient and cost optimizing custom chips to outpace the growth of general-purpose GPUs,\" he wrote in a note to clients.\nHere's the big picture: While Nvidia dominates the AI processor market today, input from Amazon and Morgan Stanley indicates the company is virtually guaranteed to lose market share in the years ahead. That does not mean Nvidia will lose its leadership position in the AI chip market. I doubt that will happen. But some spending will inevitably be redirected away from expensive Nvidia GPUs as more cost-efficient alternatives are made available.\nAdditionally, Nvidia will probably lose some pricing power as it fights to maintain its market share. Indeed, the company's gross margin declined 330 basis points sequentially in the most recent quarter, despite reporting 122% revenue growth on strong demand for its AI chips. Investors should expect that trend to continue in the coming quarters.\nHowever, Nvidia is not necessarily a bad investment. In fact, Wall Street still expects its earnings to increase at 37% annually over the next three years. That consensus estimate makes the current valuation of 56 times earnings look reasonable. Those figures give a PEG ratio of 1.5, which is well below the three-year average of 3.1.\nPersonally, I think investors looking to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom should have a position in Nvidia, and I am not alone. A recent note from Jim Kelleher at Argus reads, \"We believe that most technology investors should own [Nvidia] in the age of deep learning, AI, and GPU-driven application acceleration.\"\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Does Jim Cramer Remain Optimistic About Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)?",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Hottest 10 Stock Picks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Jim Cramer's other stock picks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer talked about what he sees as Wall Street's biggest oversights this earnings season, especially on a day when the Dow dropped 141 points, and the NASDAQ advanced 0.2%. Cramer highlighted the misleading narratives surrounding the impact of GLP-1 drugs on food and beverage companies, the reluctance to lower prices post-pandemic, the skepticism around AI investments, and the persistent belief that\nIntel remains dominant in the tech sector.\nCramer argues that if companies were more honest about their changing situations, they would gain credibility and potentially boost their stock prices. Instead, by withholding important details, they leave investors confused and more likely to make poor decisions.\n\"If companies just own up to their own changing circumstances, things would be so much easier for everybody. But who wants to admit mistakes? They earn a lot of credibility for themselves leading the higher stock prices down the line, instead their stocks languish as investors try to assess what's really going on and they presume the worst not the best.\" said Cramer.\nIn a time filled with so much misinformation, Cramer emphasized how easy it is to be misled and underscored the need to recognize these gaps. According to Cramer, despite approximately 20 million Americans reportedly using GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs, food and beverage companies refuse to acknowledge any negative impact of these medications. They won\u2019t even suggest it. Cramer argues that their denial of the effects of GLP-1 drugs is simply untrue.\n\"We know that people eat much less when they take these GLP-1s and consume less snack food because it tamps down on cravings. ...These drugs are incredibly powerful. The idea they aren't doing damage to the snack food companies is insane.\"\nCramer commented on the rising prices, stating that most companies see no need to lower them, despite significant hikes during the pandemic. He pointed out that airlines, which have consistently underperformed, refuse to reduce fares, behaving as if the price hikes never happened.\n\"In the airlines, there are endless underperformers, they simply wouldn't roll back prices, they act as if they didn't even take them up in the first place.\"\nThe same goes for hotels and entertainment venues, which sharply increased prices during the pandemic and now resist lowering them, even as demand forecasts decline. Cramer also noted that many restaurants either claim their price hikes haven't hurt sales or refuse to acknowledge the need to roll back prices.\n\"They raised prices drastically during the pandemic. They won't cap the raising prices too much even as the forecast is coming down hard.\"\nDiscussing AI, Cramer strongly disagrees with Wall Street's claim that AI investments are a waste of money. He points out that many believe big companies spending heavily on AI-related video chips aren't seeing any significant returns, and are only investing to keep up with competitors (see 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\n\"We're constantly being told that none of the big companies spending a fortune in video chips for AI has seen any meaningful return on that investment. They're only doing it to prevent their competitors from getting an edge. That's what we keep on hearing. That's absurd!\"\nCramer also challenged the common belief that INTC remains a leader in its sector. He dismissed claims that the company is poised for a major comeback, particularly in data centers, and that it has a chip capable of rivaling its competitors' dominance. He pointed out that the company's financial health tells a different story, citing the company's decision to cut its dividend last year and suspend the remainder this year. According to Cramer, these actions don't signal dominance, and he warned that this is not the same semiconductor company it once was, despite what the company might claim.\n\"I keep hearing that Intel's gonna make a huge comeback that is catching up the others in the data center. That the data center has an Nvidia killer in GE-3. That it's using the chips to sack money from you and further it's dominance. Dream on! Have you seen Intel's balance sheet? Can you read one? Do you think a company that cut its dividend last year and then suspends what was left of it this year in order to assert its dominance?! Look, this is not the Intel of old even though we want it to be. Despite Intel's protestations, I wouldn't want to be Intel's partner.\"\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is experiencing significant growth, with a 19% year-over-year revenue increase and a 75% jump in operating income last quarter. This success is largely fueled by the strong demand for AI services and the ongoing transition of corporate IT infrastructure to the cloud. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s entry into the healthcare market, particularly through Amazon Pharmacy, is showing promising results, with growing consumer adoption and increasing market share.\nDespite a recent dip in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s stock price, Wall Street analysts remain optimistic, consistently rating the stock as a \"buy\" and projecting substantial upside. Recent business developments, including securing NBA media rights and a successful Prime Day event, further support Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s strong growth outlook.\nJim Cramer explained that investors are hesitant to buy Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) because they are concerned about the potential threat from Meta. They fear that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) might catch up to and even surpass Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). This concern is well-founded, as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s advancements could pose a significant challenge to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s market position.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Two years after opening a 520,000-square-foot sortation center in Woodbury, Amazon is planning to build a second warehouse facility in the east-metro suburb.\nThe Woodbury City Council on Wednesday night signed off on the e-commerce giant\u2019s plans to build a 225,000-square-foot distribution center at the northeast corner of Hudson Road and Settlers Ridge Parkway.\nThe center, which will open in the fall of 2025, is expected to employ 180 people. The developer is Ryan Cos.\nThe center, commonly referred to as a \u201clast-mile facility,\u201d will likely enhance product delivery times for city residents, City Planner Eric Searles said. It will operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week, he said.\nDeliveries from the warehouse will be made by 450 vans between the hours of 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. According to information provided by the applicant, 70 vans will leave the center every 20 minutes, and about 20 semitrailers will make deliveries to the center from midnight to 7 a.m., he said.\nIn August 2022, Amazon opened its MSP8 sortation center at 11975 Hudson Road to support the \u201cmiddle mile,\u201d which is a stop on a package\u2019s journey between the warehouse and customers\u2019 doorsteps.\nWhen MSP8 opened, Hudson Road was improved to handle additional traffic, Searles said. For the second facility, Amazon officials have agreed to pay for a traffic signal at Hudson Road and Lake View Drive, he said.\nThe Woodbury City Council voted 4-1 to approve the project. Council member Kim Wilson, the lone dissenter, expressed concerns about the number of warehouses in the northeast part of the city and the potential noise impacts on future residents of the affordable housing project located to the south of Hudson Road.\nMayor Anne Burt said she was pleased with the number of jobs the Amazon facility will create, as well as how it will help develop the city\u2019s Northeast Business Park.\nBusiness |   Police were justified in shooting man during Woodbury Target standoff, prosecutor finds \nBusiness |   Candidate lineups set for Washington County municipal races \nBusiness |   Washington County to present design concepts for Scandia City Center \nBusiness |   St. Paul Park Heritage Days Festival has new location, family-friendly focus \nBusiness |   Prominent Twin Cities attorney disbarred for misconduct \n"

        "Title": "How the Walmart-Amazon rivalry encapsulates the Fortune 500\u2019s biggest trends",
        "Author": "  Lydia Belanger ",
        "Text": "For the past five years, the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the Fortune 500 have reflected a head-to-head retail rivalry. Walmart, which has ranked in first or second place on the list of America\u2019s biggest companies by revenue every year of the 21st century and has been No. 1 for 12 years in a row, began competing with Amazon for the top spot beginning with the 2020 list, published that spring. (On the 2022 and 2024 Global 500 lists, Amazon was also No. 2.)\nThe 2020 edition of the Fortune 500 was published amid COVID pandemic lockdowns; however, its rankings reflected results from 2019\u2014so, pre-pandemic financial performance. But from that point, Amazon\u2019s ascent to runner-up status, which had long been in the works, seemed sure to be a fixture of the list for years to come, as consumer behavior during a stay-at-home era fueled online shopping out of both necessity and boredom.\nWalmart, of course, has its own robust e-commerce business, and consumers were ordering toilet paper and disinfectants, among other items, from wherever they could get their hands on them. But as past Fortune staffer and contributor Brian Dumaine wrote in the magazine in May 2020, pegged to the release of his book Bezonomics that same month, \u201cIf you were designing a company from scratch that could capitalize on a global crisis, it would probably look a lot like Amazon.\u201d That fact goes beyond the company\u2019s status as the \u201ceverything store\u201d: Amazon Web Services cloud computing powers much of the world\u2019s digital infrastructure (which proved to be increasingly lucrative upon COVID\u2019s onset). And Prime, Amazon\u2019s subscription business, continues to entice new signups with offerings spanning retail discounts and entertainment streaming. Prime boasts a reported three times the number of members of analog Walmart+.\nOne key foothold that Walmart has over Amazon is its stores. Amazon has acquired Whole Foods, launched brick-and-mortar brands such as Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh, and partnered with many other retailers on grocery delivery and shipping. Still, given that approximately 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, Walmart has an advantage when it comes to the physical infrastructure that underpins selling goods online.\nThe Walmart-Amazon rivalry is a microcosm of many key economic dynamics that define the Fortune 500. There\u2019s much to examine about these companies\u2019 rise to become the highest-revenue-generating corporations in the world\u2014and their competition with each other.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Spencer Soper and Libby Cherry ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. has initiated an auction for German startup SellerX, taking the unusually aggressive step after a loan granted to the Amazon aggregator soured.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nHow Air Conditioning Took Over the American Office\nA Guide to Urban Swimming in Europe, Beyond the Seine\nAn advertisement published Friday in the B\u00f6rsen-Zeitung newspaper stated that the auction for the L Catterton-backed firm has been scheduled for Sept. 17 at a Berlin hotel. In Germany, such auctions can be used by creditors to seize control of companies after negotiations between an enterprise, investors and lenders have hit an impasse, often wiping out equity held by investors.\nThe move is evidence of an accelerating shakeout among companies known as aggregators that raised billions and snapped up brands sold on Amazon.com Inc., only to find themselves struggling when the pandemic-era e-commerce boom ran out of gas.\nFriday\u2019s ad notes that GLAS, a debt administration services provider, is carrying out the auction. GLAS is named in corporate filings as the security agent of SellerX\u2019s loan facility, which was granted by BlackRock and Victory Park Capital.\nBlackRock and Victory Park Capital declined to comment. L Catterton and SellerX didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nBlackRock and Victory Park Capital extended a $400 million loan to SellerX in 2021, which was increased last year when SellerX acquired fellow aggregator Elevate Brands. BlackRock has since moved the loan to nonaccrual status \u2014 which means borrowers have stopped making payments. In an earnings call earlier this month, BlackRock said it was in discussions with SellerX stakeholders to find a \u201cpath to recovery.\u201d\nSellerX, once valued at $1 billion, was among dozens of startups with audacious plans to become digital age consumer conglomerates. Instead, online sales growth slowed after the pandemic, leaving many aggregators saddled with debt they couldn\u2019t pay. That in turn forced a consolidation, pitting the who\u2019s who of the investment world against one another.\nL Catterton, the private equity firm backed by LVMH and the family holding company of the world\u2019s second wealthiest man, Bernard Arnault, made equity investments in several aggregators. BlackRock and Victory Park Capital provided loans to multiple firms. So the three companies are often negotiating turnaround strategies for distressed aggregators.\nVictory Park Capital, which in 2021 received a commitment for as much as $500 million in senior secured credit facilities from Apollo Global Management Inc., is being acquired by Janus Henderson Group Plc. The deal, announced earlier this month, is expected to close later this year.\nFounded in 2020, SellerX raised more than $750 million in debt and equity. Its founders, who served as co-chief executives, have announced plans to leave the company, news reported earlier by Sifted, which covers European startups.\n--With assistance from Verena Sepp and Mark Bergen.\n(Updated with L Catterton ownership context in eighth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nJustice Is Beside the Point in America\u2019s Immigration Courts\nPrivate Equity Is Coming for Youth Sports\nBrazil Decides to Cancel the Elon Show\nNeed 100,000 Balloons for a Convention?

        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "Cargo revenue at Sun Country Airlines inched up in the second quarter despite reduced flight activity on behalf of Amazon, but is expected to jump one year from now when the retail giant supplies additional Boeing 737-800 freighters to the carrier.\nThe two companies in late June agreed on an expanded transportation services agreement under which Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) will deliver eight Boeing 737-800 converted cargo jets it controls through a long-term lease to support package deliveries in its domestic logistics network.\nThe planes will be pulled from current contractor Atlas Air, and transferred to Sun Country starting in March of 2025. The date range provided in Friday\u2019s briefing with analysts was more specific than previous statements that the leisure airline would begin operating the initial aircraft in the first quarter, with the remainder of the planes delivered on a rolling basis by the third quarter.\nMinneapolis-based Sun Country (NASDAQ: SNCY) on Thursday reported cargo revenue of $25 million, up 1.7% from the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to an annual rate escalation that went into effect in December. Cargo flight hours dipped 2.4% to accommodate scheduled heavy maintenance, but are expected to grow in the third and fourth quarters.\nSun Country has operated a dozen Amazon-supplied Boeing narrowbody cargo jets since 2020. The revised contract for crews, maintenance and insurance to operate the eight additional cargo jets was also extended through 2030 and gives Sun Country better rates, in addition to increasing its freighter fleet to 20 aircraft.\n\u201cSun Country\u2019s cargo segment will become a larger portion of our business starting in mid-2025. By 2026, we expect revenue from our cargo segment to be almost 20% of our total revenue, versus approximately 10% in 2024. The expansion of our cargo segment comes with almost no required capex and drives improved profitability and greater free cash flow,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Dave Davis on the earnings call.\nCargo\u2019s share of operating revenue at large U.S. passenger carriers that don\u2019t operate dedicated freighters is about 3% in a typical year.\nManagement stressed that the Amazon deal will further diversify Sun Country\u2019s revenue base, placing less reliance on the volatile scheduled passenger and charter business to vacation destinations.\nAs previously announced, the airline will temporarily suspend service to some markets next year so pilots and other resources can focus on ramping up the Amazon cargo service.\nSun Country said overall revenue fell 2.6% to $254 million during the quarter. Sales were hurt by overcapacity across the domestic industry and by flight cancellations in late June. The company was able to lower unit costs by nearly 5% compared to the prior year. Net income dropped 91% to $1.8 million, the company\u2019s eighth consecutive quarter of profitability.\nSun Country\u2019s cargo revenue in 2023 increased 10.4% year over year to $100 million while most of the air cargo industry, including express air carriers, experienced downturns in aircraft utilization and revenue. The airline benefited from Amazon gaining share in a declining domestic parcel market, where it overtook FedEx and UPS last year in total deliveries. First-quarter cargo revenue at Sun Country increased 2.5%, to $24 million, from the same period a year ago.\nClick here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.\nTwitter: @ericreports / LinkedIn: Eric Kulisch / ekulisch@freightwaves.com\nAmazon transferring Boeing 737-800 cargo jets to Sun Country Airlines\nThe post Amazon flying to generate 20% of Sun Country Airlines\u2019 revenue appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Text": "Amazon\u00a0 (AMZN)  CEO Andy Jassy is sounding the alarm on a trend that is yanking consumers away from pharmacies across the nation and leading them to use Amazon Pharmacy instead.\nAs many retailers across the country are battling a spike in retail theft, which resulted in industry losses of $112.1 billion in 2022, compared to $93.9 billion in losses the previous year, retailers are experimenting with new ways to deter crime in their stores.\nRelated: Walmart is under fire over clearance pricing\nWhile some retailers have pulled self-checkout machines (which have become a source for theft), hired security guards and even embedded artificial intelligence into\u00a0surveillance\u00a0camera systems to help discourage criminals, others are resorting to locking up their products.\nDuring a recent earnings call, Jassy claimed that consumers are growing frustrated with having products locked behind cabinets at pharmacies.\n\u201cIf you walk into pharmacies in cities today, it's a pretty tough experience with how much is locked behind cabinets, where you have to press a button to get somebody to come out and open the cabinets for you and a lot of shoplifting going on in the stores,\u201d said Jassy.\nANGELA WEISS/Getty Images\nHe said that as a result, Amazon Pharmacy is \u201cdriving a lot of customer resonance and buying behavior\u201d due to its \u201cspeed and ease\u201d that physical pharmacies are starting to lack.\nPharmacies have grown to become especially susceptible to retail theft. Organized retail crime, which is when a group of people steal and resell items, occurs the most at pharmacies, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Big box stores, home improvement, and grocery stores are the next three most common targets for this type of crime.\nConsumers across the country have been taking to social media to complain about the inconvenience of having products locked up at stores, which requires having an employee to unlock items before they can be purchased.\nTarget Has Really Taken Things Too Far\u2026. Everything Is Locked! by u/zachty22 in Seattle\nLocked up Retail products are getting annoying by u/Icy-Math6444 in washdc\nIt is no surprise that consumers are starting to ditch physical pharmacies for Amazon Pharmacy, which launched in November 2020.

        "Title": "E-commerce, Amazon demand drive Cargojet volume growth",
        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "Cargojet, the largest all-cargo airline in Canada, said core transportation revenue increased 11.5% in the second quarter from the prior year as the company taps into the booming international e-commerce logistics sector.\nGrowth in e-commerce was the primary factor behind Cargojet\u2019s improved earnings and positive outlook for the second half of the year.\nRevenue from the domestic overnight network, dedicated contract flying in which transportation service is priced per flight hour and international charter service totaled CA$191.3 million, or US$139.3 million, according to Cargojet (TSX: CJT) results issued after Tuesday\u2019s market close. The company generated an additional $32.3 million from fuel surcharges. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were $57.6 million, up 6.5%, year over year, slightly ahead of consensus expectations.\nCargojet in late May began providing scheduled trans-Pacific charter service for Chinese e-commerce platforms under a three-year agreement with logistics provider Great Vision HK Express. In its earnings report, management said cooling inflation and continued interest rate reductions are giving consumers more room for discretionary purchases, especially through online retailers. The company was able to adjust its schedule to free up Boeing 767-300 converted freighters to support the Great Vision charter program without having to invest in new aircraft.\n\n\u201cThe Canadian consumer is very price-conscious. They\u2019re shopping for more value. So this China business is basically fulfilling that gap, [giving them a] better shopping environment than what was just available in e-commerce within Canada,\u201d said co-CEO Pauline Dhillon on a briefing call with analysts Wednesday morning.\nE-commerce is expected to top $82 billion in Canada and account for 12% of Canada\u2019s retail sales this year, according to eMarketer. The growth rate, however, is flattening out at about 5% per year. E-commerce penetration of sales is still below the U.S. and other countries.\nRevenue for all three business segments grew during the quarter, with the charter business reaching a quarterly record of $20.3 million.\nFlight activity increased 4.8% year over year during the second quarter and showed how demand is picking up again after contracting 5.2% last year and 2.9% in the first quarter. The improved volumes at a time of weak consumer confidence in Canada bode well for future growth when the domestic economy picks up.\n\nIncreased demand has enabled Cargojet to put its entire fleet of Boeing 757 converted freighters back to work. In late 2023, when the air cargo market was still in the early stage of recovering from a pronounced downturn, executives listed four 757s as surplus and announced plans to sell or lease them.\nDomestic volumes are benefiting from new last-mile delivery customers tendering shipments to support growing business from online retailers in Canada and strong Amazon sales, said co-CEO James Porteous. Co-load customers that contract for blocks of space in the domestic network include Amazon, FedEx, UPS and Canada Post.\nAmazon had its best Prime Days promotion in Canada during July, has reserved several Cargojet freighters for a four-to-five-day period in mid-October to support fulfillment during the next big sale, and has asked to increase its charter capacity for the peak season compared to last year, he said. The airline operated some 757 freighters for Amazon during the 2023 peak shipping season, but the retailer has asked for 767s this year \u2013 which offer 50% more capacity. Cargojet also currently operates two Amazon-supplied 767-300s for Amazon in Canada.\nTwo Cargojet freighters \u2013 a 767 provided by Amazon and a 757 \u2013 received a significant amount of damage during a hailstorm that hit Calgary International Airport on Aug. 5. Management said it has moved the planes to its main base in Hamilton, Ontario, for repairs and expects the 757 to return to service fairly quickly. The 767 will take another week or more to complete repairs, but the airline is using backup aircraft to make sure Amazon can serve customers on time.\nAfter operating 17 or 18 dedicated freighters under long-term leases during the busy period last year, \u201cit\u2019s entirely realistic to expect that we\u2019ll operate more than that in peak season because of that demand,\u201d Porteous added.\nDemand was strong across the board. DHL Express, which contracts with Cargojet to fly packages in its parcel network, is also seeing higher demand out of China and Europe, and the charter segment conducted an \u201cunprecedented\u201d 31 flights in June, the Cargojet chief executive said.\nManagement indicated the ability to add another 5% to 10% in volume growth during the second half without having to add aircraft, especially as two more aircraft will come out of heavy maintenance by November to help with the higher loads.\nThe contract with Great Vision HK Express came together in a couple of months, \u201ca lot quicker than a normal contract of that magnitude and size,\u201d Porteous said, reflecting the spike in direct-to-consumer fulfillment from China to North America in the past year. The full impact of the new business will be felt in the third and fourth quarters.\n\nCargojet is providing three flights per week out of Hangzhou to Vancouver, British Columbia, and its ability to feed 15 other major cities in Canada through its domestic network appealed to the Chinese logistics company, he said. Great Vision HK Express, which analysts suspect is moving shipments for Shein and Temu, also controls two Boeing 777 flights per week from Shanghai to Toronto that are operated by a Chinese carrier.\nPorteous said the $116 million estimated value of the Great Vision HK Express contract doesn\u2019t include potential incremental revenue if the shipments are tendered for further distribution into Canada or for additional frequencies from China as Great Vision\u2019s business grows.\nCargojet has a fleet of 41 Boeing 757 and 767 freighter aircraft. The company said it accelerated conversion plans for two Boeing 767 passenger jets because of the rebound in demand, with deliveries expected in the first and second quarters of 2025. One of those aircraft will replace a 767-200 with a lease that expires in February. Porteous said the company is confident about the fleet additions, considering the reductions at other Canadian airlines and the limited global availability of freighter capacity during a rising market. Last week, Air Canada disclosed that it has parked two Boeing 767-300 cargo jets because it doesn\u2019t have enough business to justify the expense of operating them.\nThe updated 2024 budget includes $33 million in capital expenditures for fleet growth \u2013\u00a0 a sharp reduction from recent years but more than the $18 million originally budgeted at the start of the year. Cargojet recently acquired two Boeing 767-300s as feedstock for future passenger-to-freighter conversions. Management, however, is emphasizing increased cash flow to reward investors with dividend growth and share buybacks. The conservative approach is a reversal from two years ago when management admittedly overreached on fleet growth on the assumption that superheated cargo demand would continue after the pandemic. Cargojet in the past year backed out of investments for eight Boeing 777 converted freighters and sold four aircraft it had already acquired.\n\u201cCargojet is well positioned to capture growth opportunities that will provide the returns required to support the current level of invested capital,\u201d the company said in an addendum to the financial statement, adding that early signs point to a potential strong finish for the year.\nCargojet enters charter deal for Chinese e-commerce\nThe post E-commerce, Amazon demand drive Cargojet volume growth appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s 10 Stock Picks You Shouldn\u2019t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Jim Cramer's other top stock picks.\nJim Cramer reacted to Monday\u2019s market by questioning if there\u2019s any money left to invest and why mutual funds aren\u2019t holding enough cash. The S&P 500 fell 17.77 points, or 0.3%, to 5,616.84. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.44 points, or 0.2% to 41,240.52. The Nasdaq composite fell 152.03 points, or 0.9%, to 17,725.76.\n\u201cWhat do we do if we\u2019re out of money? Don\u2019t mutual funds have enough cash? That\u2019s my reaction to today\u2019s market action. Right now, mutual funds know they have to pivot out of consistent growth stocks, especially tech stocks like software and semiconductors, which don\u2019t benefit from rate cuts. They need to swap into companies that can supercharge their earnings as the Fed lowers rates. We all recognize that cyclical stocks, the ones that benefit from lower rates, can go higher, maybe much higher.\u201d\nCramer pointed out that mutual funds now need to shift away from consistent growth stocks, particularly in tech sectors like software and semiconductors, which don\u2019t benefit from interest rate cuts. Instead, they should move towards companies that can boost their earnings as the Federal Reserve reduces rates.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s painful for many of you are the declines in stocks of companies with consistent earnings. These companies, especially tech firms, don\u2019t really need lower rates, and they\u2019re selling off as money managers raise capital to rotate into the rate-cut winners.\nCramer explained that cyclical stocks, which tend to perform better with lower rates, are likely to rise, possibly significantly. However, the decline in stocks of companies with stable earnings, especially in tech, is troubling for many investors. These stocks are being sold off as money managers raise capital to invest in those poised to benefit from rate cuts.\nCramer emphasized that it\u2019s important to understand who the winners and losers are in this situation. The winners include two groups: high-dividend-yield stocks and cyclical companies expected to see earnings growth from lower rates, particularly in the housing sector.\nCramer noted that housing stocks, which had seen significant gains, were down on Monday because hedge funds and mutual funds had bought heavily before the Federal Reserve\u2019s Jackson Hole meeting. While mutual funds are holding on, hedge funds are cashing in their profits, as these stocks had sharp increases before the event. For traders, taking profits after such a successful trade is standard practice.\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with the most direct beneficiaries: housing. These stocks were all down today because hedge funds and mutual funds bought them aggressively ahead of Friday\u2019s Jackson Hole verdict. Mutual funds are staying long, but hedge funds are ringing the register furiously because they\u2019ve made so much money. Housing stocks had parabolic moves going into the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole conference, so now these portfolio managers are just taking profits. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do with a successful trade if you\u2019re a trader.\nCramer believes that while the housing trade may be over for traders, the housing investment story isn\u2019t finished. He also warned that the recent reversal in housing stocks could limit their potential, as investors are wary of the technical trends.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, though. This kind of reversal I\u2019m talking about can be hideous. Some of these stocks are very close to their highs, and I don\u2019t like that.\u201d\nCramer cautioned that these kinds of reversals can be severe and might discourage new buyers. He reminded everyone that by the time the Federal Reserve signals a clear path forward, it might be too late to buy the most obvious rate-cut winners. According to Cramer, it\u2019s better to wait for these stocks to pull back and recharge before making a move.\n\u201cThose who have them can hold on, but they flew too close to the sun to attract new buyers. Remember, I\u2019ve said all along that by the time the Fed gives the all-clear, it may be too late to buy the most obvious rate-cut winners. You have to let them recharge, let them come down, and then you can pull the trigger.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we analyzed a recent episode of Jim Cramer\u2019s Mad Money and picked the ten notable stocks he mentioned. We also explore what hedge funds think about these stocks and rank them based on how many hedge funds own them, from the fewest to the most.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\nJim Cramer expressed his enthusiasm for Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), highlighting its potential to revolutionize shopping by anticipating customers\u2019 needs even before they realize them. He believes that if Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) can manage to group and process same-day purchases efficiently, it could lead to significant cost savings. Cramer sees this capability as a major step forward for the company.\n\u201cI like Amazon\u2014the possibility of knowing exactly what you want before you even thought of it is the next frontier. If Amazon can find a way to batch every same-day purchase, I think it can save a fortune.\u201d\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an attractive investment due to its leading position in e-commerce and cloud computing, strong financial performance, and strategic growth initiatives. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) excels in global e-commerce with its broad product range, competitive pricing, and efficient delivery network, which consistently drives revenue growth. Amazon Web Services (AWS) continues to be a major profit engine, benefiting from its ongoing innovation and expansion in the cloud market.\nAdditionally, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s strategic investments and acquisitions enhance its market presence and foster growth across various sectors. The rapidly growing advertising segment provides high-margin revenue, boosting overall profitability. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s focus on technological innovation and improving customer experience further strengthens its competitive advantage. Furthermore, Amazon.com Inc.

Wood\u2019s flagship fund ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is down about 18% so far this year and has lost about 75% of its value since hitting its peak in 2021. However, the latest data shows that the innovation-focused investor bought the dip on tech stocks after the latest selloff that shook financial markets globally.\nInvestors have pulled about $2.2 billion from ARK funds in 2024. The fund is on track to post its worst year of investor exodus since 2014. But Cathie Wood is doubling down on her innovation bets and is hopeful the upcoming rate cuts will be positive for the stock market.\nCathie Wood Says \u201cSomething Is Changing\u201d and the Fed is Now on \u201cHigh Alert\u201d\nTalking about the market situation, Cathie Wood said in a\u00a0latest video\u00a0on her YouTube channel that the recent selloff shows the market is going through a \u201ccathartic\u201d phase and \u201csomething is changing.\u201d\n\u201cI do believe that the Fed now is on high alert because the stock market seemed to be encouraging the Fed to hold tight, higher for longer, make sure that the inflation was out of the system.\u201d\nCathie Wood said that corporations are now in a weaker position amid high rates and they will initiate layoffs to cut costs and increase productivity. This weak employment situation could encourage the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates, according to Wood.\n\u201cInterest rates coming down should be very positive for the equity markets, but they will not arrest a recession very quickly. In fact, if consumers and businesses know that interest rates and maybe prices will be coming down, what will they do? They will wait.\u201d\nCathie Wood\u2019s ARK has posted its latest stock holdings data as of the end of the June quarter.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 10 Bullish Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Jim Cramer's other bullish stock picks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed his enthusiasm for the current market, highlighting a significant historical perspective. He reminded viewers that 20 years ago, Google went public at $85 per share and closed its first day up 18%. While many traders were thrilled by this initial gain, looking back, it was a major missed opportunity. The stock has since delivered a 7,736% return, far exceeding the S&P 500\u2019s return of just over 600%. This example illustrates the potential wealth individual stocks can offer compared to broader indices, especially if you choose wisely.\n\"Twenty years ago today, Google went public at a split-unadjusted price of $85 per share. On its first day, the stock closed up 18%. Many traders, thrilled by this initial gain, took the profit. In retrospect, this was one of the greatest mistakes of all time. It has since delivered a 7,736% return, compared to the S&P 500's return of slightly more than 600% with dividends. This serves as a reminder of the wealth that individual stocks can generate compared to indices when you choose wisely. And I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s not that hard if you know how to research. So, I think it's time to reconsider the average approach, at least for today.\"\nCramer noted that, despite a strong recent performance\u2014with the Dow gaining 237 points, the S&P 500 up 0.97%, and the NASDAQ increasing by 1.39%\u2014the short-term market outlook is more complex. The market is currently on its longest winning streak since November of last year, with 93% of S&P 500 stocks showing gains.\nHowever, he cautioned that the market might be \"overbought,\" as indicated by the Market Edge oscillator, a tool Cramer has relied on since 1987. When the oscillator reaches plus five or higher, it signals that it might be time to sell. Conversely, readings of minus five or lower indicate oversold conditions, suggesting it's a good time to buy.\n\"Even though it was another good day for the markets. we need to consider both the short-term and long-term outlooks. The short-term setup isn\u2019t as favorable. We\u2019re currently on a significant winning streak, with the market having risen for straight days, the longest streak since November of last year. Impressively, 93% of the S&P 500 stocks are up. \"\nThis follows a Monday when the market dropped sharply due to the Yen carry trade imploding, which led to a wave of forced selling and subsequent panic.\n\"As I've often said, panic is not a strategy. Since that panic, the market has mostly been trending upward.\"\nJim Cramer has also expressed concern about the upcoming Justice Department case challenging the search engine giant's role in the advertising exchange market. This legal issue could have a significant negative impact on it, a company that has greatly benefited from this setup. A victory for the Justice Department could be even more damaging than the previous issue with Apple over default search engine payments, which contributed to its monopoly concerns.\nAccording to Cramer, the resilience of tech giants is evident, with strong recoveries even after short-term dips. (see 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\nJim Cramer emphasizes that investing in truly exceptional companies, rather than merely following market indices, usually leads to the best returns. Cramer advises investors to avoid panicking during market fluctuations and to maintain their focus on holding strong companies for long-term success.\n\"As we move forward, it's important to remember that investing in truly great companies, rather than just following the index, often yields the best returns. The substantial gain from Google over 20 years exemplifies this. Avoiding panic during market turbulence and sticking with strong companies is crucial for long-term success.\"\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we reviewed a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money and highlighted ten stocks that he is optimistic about. We also included information on hedge fund sentiment for each stock and ranked them based on how many hedge funds own each one, starting with the least owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), there was disappointment with recent performance, with concerns about consumer spending slowing down. However, Morgan Stanley recently reported optimism for same-day consumable sales, which are becoming increasingly popular.\n\"Similar to Amazon, people were disappointed with the last quarter, with a lot of talk about consumers tapping out. Today, Morgan Stanley came out and said there's hope for same-day consumable sales, which are becoming habit-forming. Amazon's making a comeback\u2014up 18 points from where it fell after the setback.\"\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to lead in global e-commerce with its wide range of products, efficient logistics, and focus on customer satisfaction. Its cloud computing arm, AWS, drives significant growth due to high demand for cloud services and strong profit margins. Amazon Prime\u2019s growing subscriber base benefits from perks like free shipping, streaming services, and exclusive deals.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s substantial investment in technology, including artificial intelligence and automation, boosts efficiency and supports innovation. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s diverse revenue sources\u2014advertising, subscription services, and physical retail stores like Whole Foods\u2014help manage risks and provide multiple growth opportunities. With solid financial results, including strong revenue growth, high-profit margins from AWS, and healthy cash flow, Amazon.com, Inc.

        "Author": "  HALELUYA HADERO ",
        "Text": "Prosecutors at a federal labor agency have determined that Amazon is a joint employer of subcontracted drivers who delivered packages for the company in California, pushing back on claims from the online retailer that they are not its employees.\nThe decision, made by a regional director for the National Labor Relations Board in Los Angeles, came after the agency investigated unfair labor practice charges filed against the company by the Teamsters union.\nThe prominent labor group represents UPS drivers and has been seeking to unionize Amazon drivers. However, it has encountered challenges, most notably because the company doesn\u2019t directly employ drivers but relies on thousands of third-party businesses that deliver millions of customer packages every day.\nCurrently, over 275,000 drivers are employed with these businesses, which are called Delivery Service Partners, or DSPs.\nThe Teamsters and other labor advocates have long said Amazon exercises great control over the drivers - including by determining their routes, setting delivery targets and monitoring their performances - and should be classified as a joint employer.\nLast year, the Teamsters said they unionized dozens of drivers who work for one DSP in Palmdale, California called Battle Tested Strategies. The labor group filed several unfair labor practice charges against Amazon after the company refused to negotiate a union contract with them.\nOn Thursday, NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado said agency prosecutors made \u201cmerit determinations\u201d on three of those charges, one being that Amazon and Battle Tested Strategies were joint employers of the drivers who work for the firm.\nProsecutors also determined Amazon made unlawful threats and failed to provide relevant information to the union. They further found that the two employers \u201cunlawfully failed and refused to bargain with the union over the effects of the decision to terminate\u201d the DSP\u2019s contract last year, Blado said.\nHowever, the prosecutors dismissed other charges against Amazon, she said, including one that alleged that the company\u2019s decision to terminate its contract with the unionized DSP was a retaliatory move.\nIf a settlement is not reached, the agency can bring a complaint against Amazon, which would be litigated within the NLRB\u2019s administrative law system. Amazon has the option to appeal a judge\u2019s order to the agency\u2019s board and eventually, to a federal court.\n\u201cAs we have said all along, there is no merit to the Teamsters\u2019 claims,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards said in a statement. \u201cIf and when the agency decides it wants to litigate the remaining allegations, we expect they will be dismissed as well.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Teamster General President Sean M. O\u2019Brien championed the findings.\n\u201cAmazon drivers have taken their future into their own hands and won a monumental determination that makes clear Amazon has a legal obligation to bargain with its drivers over their working conditions,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n"

However, small retailers have often alleged that the regulations are bypassed using complicated business structures.\nCommerce Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday signalled out Amazon's business practices and said the company's investments in India have often been used to cover its business losses.\nGoyal, however, did not provide any evidence to substantiate the claim.\n\"When Amazon says we are going to invest a billion dollars in India and we all celebrate, we forget the underlying story that the billion dollars is not coming in for any great service,\" Goyal said at an event in New Delhi, where he did not name any other company.\nDo the losses \"not smell of predatory pricing to any of you ... what was that loss for, they are not allowed to sell to consumers (directly),\" he added.\nAmazon and Flipkart did not respond to requests for comment.\nAmazon in June last year said it will increase its India investments to $26 billion by 2030, including for its cloud business. It is also targeting merchandise exports worth $20 billion from India by 2025.\nGoyal has in the past attacked U.S. e-commerce giants publicly. In 2021, he said companies were using their scale and access to large pools of low-cost capital \"to the detriment of mom-and-pop stores\" and that they \"very blatantly flouted\" laws.\nA Reuters special report in 2021 found Amazon's internal documents showed the U.S. e-commerce company helped a small number of sellers prosper on its Indian platform, gave them discounted fees and used them to bypass foreign investment laws.\nAmazon had then said that it is confident of local law compliance and it \"does not give preferential treatment to any seller\".\nSubsequently, though, it was announced that two of Amazon's big sellers facing such allegations will stop selling products on its website.\n\"They create entities ... when they get caught they start closing down those entities,\" Goyal said on Wednesday.\nAmazon and Flipkart are also facing an antitrust investigation in India but deny any wrongdoing.\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Shivangi Acharya; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)\n"

        "Text": "Full disclosure: I own shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and am bullish about its prospects. I think the company will continue to reign as the No. 1 e-commerce platform and cloud services provider. It won't surprise me in the least if Amazon's market cap doubles or more by the end of the decade.\nThat said, Amazon won't be the biggest stock on the market despite delivering strong gains, in my view. I predict the following three stocks will be worth more than Amazon 10 years from now.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) briefly forfeited its throne earlier this year as the company with the biggest market cap. It could do so again. Nonetheless, I expect it will still be worth more than Amazon in 2034.\nAmazon's market cap is roughly $1.5 trillion lower than Apple's right now. The only way it could make up that gap is if Apple performs dismally. I wouldn't bet on that happening.\nSure, Apple's iPhone sales growth has evaporated in recent years. That could soon change, though. Apple Intelligence (the company's name for its generative artificial intelligence [GenAI] capabilities) will run only on iPhone 15 Pro and later models. Several Wall Street analysts project that GenAI could spark a huge iPhone upgrade supercycle. I agree with their reasoning.\nDon't overlook the potential for 6G to be another massive growth driver for Apple. The next generation of wireless technology could be available early in the next decade. It could be a game-changer in ushering in widespread adoption of augmented reality and perhaps even holographic displays on Apple's iPhones.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) isn't too far behind Apple, with a market cap hovering around $3 trillion. I don't see Amazon vaulting past the tech giant over the next 10 years, even if it delivers stronger growth (which I suspect could happen).\nAmazon and Microsoft share at least one key growth driver: organizations' migration of apps and data to the cloud. Although Microsoft Azure is a distant second to Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the cloud services market now, I think the gap will narrow over time.\nMicrosoft's ace in the hole could be its relationship with OpenAI. It has already integrated GPT-4 throughout its product suite and cloud offerings. If GPT-5 fulfills its potential, it and future large language models (LLMs) developed by OpenAI and adopted by Microsoft could fuel tremendous growth for both companies.\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) market cap of $2 trillion isn't too much greater than Amazon's. I predict the Google parent will still be ahead of Amazon 10 years from now for a few key reasons.\nLike Microsoft, Alphabet could gain ground on AWS in the cloud services market. Its Google Cloud is already growing much faster than AWS. Google's AI expertise could enable it to accelerate this growth.\nI also think technologies of the future could provide massive tailwinds for Alphabet. The company is already racing to develop AI-powered agents that perform lots of tasks for customers. It's a leader in quantum computing. 6G could present a fantastic opportunity for Google Pixel smartphones and other Android devices. And with Waymo, Alphabet is poised to be one of the biggest winners in what could be a multitrillion-dollar robotaxi market.\nWill my prediction come true? I think so. However, there's a chance I could be wrong.\nAmazon's growth could be even better than I anticipate. The company could move into new markets more aggressively than before. It could out-innovate rivals, including those mentioned above.\nAny or all of the companies I expect to be bigger than Amazon 10 years from now could stumble. Apple's GenAI initiatives might not ignite an iPhone upgrade supercycle. Microsoft might be unable to capitalize on new AI developments from OpenAI for some reason (perhaps OpenAI stumbles or the two companies' relationship sours). Alphabet's Google Search dominance could disappear due to regulatory actions and/or new AI capabilities.\nStill, I wouldn't bet against Apple, Microsoft, or Alphabet -- or Amazon either. Instead, I own all four stocks and don't plan on selling them.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Warren Buffett and Hedge Funds Are Crazy About These 10 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks recommended by Warren Buffett and hedge funds.\nWarren Buffett will go down in history as one of the most successful investors on Wall Street, a feat achieved through integrity, wisdom and wit. He is dubbed the Oracle of Omaha on his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, delivering a compounded annual gain of 19.8% since 1958, more than double an increase of 9.9% for the S&P 500. Berkshire Hathaway stock has gained over 3,787,464% since 1965 compared to a 24,708% gain for the S&P 500, underlining Buffett's stock-picking skills.\nBuffett is one of the most accomplished investors in the history of Wall Street having amassed a wealth of $138 billion, as reported by Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. His net worth could have been much more had he not made generous contributions to various charitable organizations. In contrast to many other billionaires who prefer lavish lifestyles in large homes and luxury vehicles, Buffett is often seen as one of the most humble billionaires globally.\nThe significant investment gains over the years stem from Buffett buying stocks in various sectors and holding them for years and even decades. Buffett's secret to prosperity mainly lies in investing in well-established, reputable companies with clear competitive edges. Although this approach focuses heavily on undervalued stocks, it also occasionally includes investments in high-growth companies.\nThe investment strategy is often backed by the massive cash haul that Berkshire Hathaway holds on generating earnings per share on most of its investments and through dividend payments. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about a particular clique of stocks.\nHigh-growth companies and market leaders in respective fields are some of the factors that Buffett and most hedge funds closely watch while selecting stocks.\u00a0 Technology stocks which consist of some of the biggest companies account for 41% of Buffett's 13F portfolio at the end of March, an edge that has always allowed him to outperform the overall market.\nDiversification is another important factor in the top stocks that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about. While technology stocks account for the biggest share, the billionaire investor is also heavily invested in Financials at 21% and Basic Material at 10.7%. Diversifying aligns with the billionaire investor value investing principles that involve pursuing undervalued investments in various sectors.\nOver the years, Buffett has always sought securities whose prices are undervalued relative to their intrinsic value. Rather than focusing on short-term gains in the market, the Berkshire Hathaway chief selects stocks based on their long-term potential. It was one of the reasons that Berkshire Hathaway shares ended 2023 with a 15.8% gain, representing an eighth straight year of advances. Its biggest increase of 29.6% came in 2021 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile Berkshire Hathaway had $189 billion in cash as of the end of the first quarter, the cash haul is expected to surge to $300 billion by the end of the third quarter. While most people might wonder why Buffett is not putting much of the cash to work, the billionaire investor is always cautious focusing on value investments rather than just investing for the sake.\nThe billionaire investor is always driven by the mantra: never invest in overvalued equities. Therefore he always takes time scanning for value investments trading at discounted valuations. Additionally, the sheer size of Berkshire Hathaway means it can only put its money into a select few companies that will significantly impact its returns. This is further compounded by the fact that investments in cash equivalents, such as short-term government bonds, are currently offering returns above 5% which is quite high at current levels. As a result, Warren Buffett and his firm are deliberately seeking the perfect investment at the perfect price, and this opportunity could arise at any moment.\nIn the recent past, Buffett has also gone against the wave amid a shift of focus from oil and gas investment plays amid the transition to clean energy. Buffett remains bullish about investment opportunities in the energy sector amid the carbon care initiatives even as the biggest players continue generating significant returns from the lucrative fossil fuel business. Buffett and hedge funds have also taken keen interest in stocks offering exposure to emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence that are driving valuations higher in the market.\nIn this article, we take a look at some of the top stocks in which Buffett and other hedge funds are heavily invested. Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about these 10 stocks partly because of their growth metrics and long-term prospects. While some of the stocks are trading at a premium valuation, they are market leaders in their respective fields and, therefore, well-positioned to generate long-term value. We have ranked the stocks in Warren Buffett's portfolio based on the number of hedge funds invested and selected the top 10.\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the stock that Warren Buffett and hedge funds are crazy about, owing to its leading position in e-commerce and cloud computing. While Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) made a name for itself in selling goods online, it is increasingly becoming a force to reckon with as it continues to leverage artificial intelligence to strengthen its edge on cloud computing.\nAmazon Web Services, the company's cloud unit, is already designing its chips and is increasingly integrating AI into its offerings to strengthen its competitive edge against Microsoft (MSFT). In addition, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is already eyeing new growth opportunities through its satellite internet subsidiary, Kuiper.\nAs of the end of the first quarter, Warren Buffett and a total of 302 hedge funds held stakes in the tech giant, affirming why it is one of the top stocks.\nIn its investor letter from May 2024, Lakehouse Global Growth Fund provided an update on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), sharing their analysis and perspective on the company's performance and future prospects:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered an impressive quarterly result that also came in well ahead of analyst expectations. Net sales increased 13% year-on-year to $143.3 billion and operating profits increased 219% year-on-year to $15.3 billion (vs the high end of guidance at $12.0 billion). As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U.S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett and hedge funds. You can visit Warren Buffett and Hedge Funds Are Crazy About These 10 Stocks\u00a0to see the other stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other fast money stocks.\nAs the financial world grapples with shifting economic indicators and political uncertainty, insights from leading experts offer a crucial perspective on what lies ahead. With inflation showing signs of easing and the Federal Reserve signaling a likely rate cut, the focus now shifts to earnings performance and broader economic trends. Adding to this complexity are political developments, such as the possibility of a Republican sweep.\nThe latest June 2024 inflation report revealed a softer-than-expected outcome, causing varied reactions across major stock indices. Initially, futures surged in response, but have since fluctuated. Currently, the Dow is showing gains, the S&P is up slightly, and the NASDAQ is just below the flatline. Inflation dropped by a tenth of a percent month-over-month, contrary to economists' forecasts of a rise.\nChris Harvey, Head of Equity Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, and Mike Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JPMorgan, shared their perspectives on the current financial situation in an episode of CNBC's Fast Money. Chris Harvey is cautious about the concept of market rotation due to ongoing uncertainties about earnings. While he doesn't oppose rotation, he pointed out that investor confidence is still shaky.\n\"That\u2019s right. We\u2019re not against rotation; we\u2019re just waiting for more clarity. Many investors are uncertain about earnings. Until we see a situation where companies don\u2019t go down on bad news, we won\u2019t be fully convinced about the rotation. We want people to believe that numbers will improve and that things will get better. However, right now, bad news is bad news, and that suggests the rotation may not be sustainable.\"\nIn contrast, Mike Feroli discussed the anticipated rate cuts. He believes that the Fed is likely to lower rates soon due to its more aggressive stance. Feroli suggests that the economy is weaker than some might think, which supports the expectation of rate cuts. He noted that we have probably reached the peak for interest rates and that future attention will shift to earnings performance.\nFeroli also explained why he updated his forecast to September. This change is based on recent CPI data showing significant inflation drops over the past year and a rise in unemployment. He expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, with additional cuts likely on a quarterly basis.\n\"Yes, the rate cuts are coming. The Fed has signaled their intention to cut rates more aggressively than they have in the past. We also believe the economy isn\u2019t as strong as some might think, so we expect rates to come down. I think we\u2019ve already hit the peak for rates. Right now, it\u2019s really about earnings.\"\nHowever, if the labor market weakens further, the pace of these cuts could accelerate. Regarding the potential impact of a Donald Trump presidency and a possible Republican sweep, Feroli highlighted the uncertainties. A Republican sweep could lead to more tax cuts, possibly extending or expanding those from 2017, which might boost growth but also increase deficits.\nAdditionally, trade and immigration policies remain unpredictable. While deregulation might mitigate some negative effects, the overall policy environment is still uncertain. Finally, when asked about the implications of a Republican sweep for bond markets, Feroli expressed concern about the deficit trajectory. Extending all tax cuts, particularly in a more Republican-leaning scenario, could exacerbate the deficit problem.\nIn another episode of Fast Money, Chris Mman, Chief Investment Officer at Lafayette College, discussed the potential timing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, emphasizing that September appears to be a strong possibility. He notes, however, that the Fed will be influenced by upcoming economic reports. Mman also highlights concerns over equity valuations and the potential impact of delayed rate cuts on the labor market.\n\"I believe July should have been on the table based on today\u2019s report. However, the Fed usually prefers to signal their plans in advance. My expectation was that they probably wouldn't preemptively set up for September, but given today\u2019s report, it seems quite likely they will. The Fed might use upcoming meetings and communications to guide the market's expectations.\"\nAs political uncertainties, including the Democratic ticket's spotlight, add to the mix, Mman reassures that the Fed is likely to focus on economic data rather than political pressures. He stresses that while inflation remains a critical issue, the Fed's priority will be managing employment trends to avoid a deeper economic downturn.\n\"Even if inflation accelerates temporarily, it\u2019s unlikely to concern the Fed greatly. Currently, the focus has shifted more to employment reports rather than inflation. If employment were to unexpectedly strengthen, it could reduce the Fed\u2019s incentive to cut rates. Ultimately, the goal is to avoid a severe economic slowdown that would force them into aggressive rate cuts.\"\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we review recent episodes of CNBC's Fast Money, where Fast Money traders highlighted stocks with high growth potential. We tracked each stock mentioned and ranked them based on frequency. From this, we identified the top 7 stocks that were mentioned a lot by Fast Money traders and were widely held by hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s cloud computing arm, is a key driver of the company\u2019s overall growth.\nAs the leader in cloud infrastructure, AWS offers critical services across various industries, with its high-profit margins significantly boosting Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s overall profitability, effectively balancing the lower margins from its retail operations. As more businesses transition to cloud-based solutions, AWS is well-positioned to capture a large share of this expanding market, ensuring continued revenue and profit growth for Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). In addition to its strengths in e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also expanding into other high-growth areas such as advertising, streaming, and artificial intelligence.\nAmazon.com Inc.

        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "(Updated at 6:50 ET with new DHL developments)\nMembers of the Teamsters union may picket outside Amazon\u2019s national air cargo hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) without interference from local officials, a federal judge has ruled.\nMeanwhile, more than1,300 sort workers at DHL Express\u2019s global hub at CVG airport have joined Teamsters Local 89 after the company voluntarily recognized their right to collective bargain, the union announced Monday.\nThe Teamsters have ramped up efforts to organize Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) warehouse workers and drivers ever since securing a major contract win at UPS last summer. The union has spent the past three months trying to win the support of 4,000 workers at Amazon\u2019s primary air hub as their representative in collective bargaining. Last month it conducted a protest march outside Amazon\u2019s regional air hub in San Bernardino, California, that included some warehouse and ramp workers who the union claimed walked off the job to participate.\n\nJudge Danny Reeves of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky issued a preliminary injunction last week against the Kenton County Airport Board\u2019s denial of a protest request, saying it likely violated Teamsters Local 89\u2019s free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution.\nThe airport authority said it had turned down the union\u2019s application for permission to demonstrate against Amazon because the public road outside the air hub isn\u2019t approved for expressive activity and that its rules permit a maximum of 10 individuals in any designated area at a given time, according to court documents. CVG airport has several designated protest areas, including two new ones closer to the cargo area, but they aren\u2019t near the Amazon facility.\nAbout 75 Teamsters and Amazon workers marched with signs outside the Amazon entrance on July 24, despite the denial of the union\u2019s application.\nThe District Court said higher courts have previously determined that public streets are constitutionally protected areas for groups to express their opinions and that there were no safety reasons that justified forcing demonstrators to use the designated protest areas.\n\n\u201cDesignated areas for expressive activity are available in the cargo delivery area at some distance from Amazon\u2019s entrance, but the defendants concede that the plaintiff\u2019s intended audience would be reduced by utilizing these sites. Further, there is no question that limiting the number of picketers to ten reduces the impact of the plaintiff\u2019s message,\u201d the judge wrote.\nThe Teamsters have filed unfair labor charges with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that Amazon has resisted unionization efforts. Amazon has steadfastly fought all efforts to unionize its workforce around the country.\n\u201cThis is a significant victory for Amazon workers in Northern Kentucky and around the country who are sick of being silenced by this trillion-dollar corporation. Amazon workers everywhere are coming together to become Teamsters and win the rights and protections they deserve,\u201d said Teamsters General President Sean O\u2019Brien in a news release.\u00a0 \u201cYou can be sure the Teamsters will carry this precedent to other communities around the country where Amazon is exploiting loopholes and breaking laws to take advantage of workers and inflate its bottom line. Our union of 1.3 million hardworking members applaud the court for doing the right thing in this case.\u201d\nCVG is a critical part of Amazon\u2019s ability to provide one-and-two day delivery for Amazon Prime members.\nAfter initially borrowing space from DHL Express, Amazon opened its own $1.5 billion facility at CVG three years ago. Flights at CVG increased from 57.5 to 63.3 per day in the past 12 months, not including flights by unmarked partner carriers, according to a March report from researchers at DePaul University.\nThe Teamsters conducted a one-day \u201cstrike\u201d outside Amazon\u2019s Western Region air hub at San Bernardino International Airport on July 22 to complain about alleged retaliation against workers for attempting to unionize and the need for better pay and work conditions.\nUnder federal labor law, workers don\u2019t need to belong to a recognized labor union to strike.\nThe Amazon Labor Union, a grassroots organization that won a 2022 vote to unionize 5,500 workers at a giant Amazon facility in Staten Island, agreed in June to affiliate with the Teamsters.\n\nAbout 1,100 DHL Express ramp and tug workers at CVG agreed to a contract early this year after joining the Teamsters union in 2023 and going on strike for 12 days in December. The Teamsters on Monday said 1,300 sort workers in the air cargo terminal have joined the union and will be covered by the same contract as the workers that load and unload aircraft.\n\u201cNo one better represents and protects American workers in delivery and logistics than the Teamsters Union, and this significant agreement for recognition at DHL will continue to make workers even stronger in the industry,\u201d said O\u2019Brien. \u201cThe Teamsters applaud DHL for respecting its workforce in this campaign. DHL is helping to set better examples for all employers about the dignity that working people deserve. The Teamsters will not rest until all Amazon employees performing the exact same jobs secure the dignity and respect that they have earned as well.\u201d\nDHL Express workers at Cincinnati airport reach deal, end strike\nThe post Teamsters can protest at Amazon air hub, federal court says appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) -Rivian has temporarily suspended production of its commercial delivery vans used by retail giant Amazon.com due to a shortage of parts, a spokesperson for the electric vehicle manufacturer said on Friday.\nShares of the Irvine, California-based company were down 4%.\nThe production halt is the latest in a series of supply chain challenges for Rivian, which, like other EV makers, has grappled with significant production issues over the past two years due to supplier shortages.\n\"A part shortage has temporarily impacted our Electric Delivery Van (EDV) production. We expect to recover all missed production,\" the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\nThe company did not disclose any information about the specific part and supplier in question and also declined comment on when the production stoppage began and if it has resumed.\nRivian produces all its vehicles at its factory in Normal, Illinois, with a second assembly plant planned in Georgia.\nThe part shortage would not affect the production of other Rivian vehicles, including its R1S SUV and R1T pickup models. Amazon said it is aware of Rivian's \"short-term production issues this month\", but does not expect it to have an impact.\nThe e-commerce giant, Rivian's largest investor with a 16% stake, has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans to be deployed by 2030. Last year, sales to Amazon represented approximately 19% of Rivian's revenue.\nEarlier this month, Rivian had maintained its production forecast and said that deliveries would be slightly lower in the current quarter after it shut down its factory in April for retooling and modifications.\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)\n"

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): The Best Among The American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors",
        "Author": "  Fatima Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other American stocks.\nHistorically, September is considered to be the worst month for stocks. The S&P 500 index has generally averaged a decline in the month of September for decades, which has resulted in many financial news reporters, such as the Wall Street Journal, dubbing September as a weak month for US stocks. So with August coming to an end, many investors in the US and abroad may be wondering whether now is a good time to pick up US stocks for their portfolios.\nWhile history can often be an accurate indicator of stock performance, this is not always the case. This year may very well be an outlier in the historical trend outlined above, seeing as many financial analysts are expecting the US Federal Reserve to move ahead with a rate cut this September. CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on August 21 highlighted that according to the Fed's recent meeting minutes, it is quite probable that we will be seeing a rate cut this September, which will probably result in stock prices rising and the markets performing better. This is because when a rate cut is announced, consumers and businesses tend to increase their spending and investment, which has a direct and positive impact on stock prices, causing them to rise. As such, if we do see a rate cut next month, investors may actually benefit from investing in American stocks.\nOn August 22, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss the status of the US markets at present. Here's what he had to say:\n\"The FMOC minutes that came out yesterday showed the Fed staff saying this is a strong labor market, while that jobs report that came out Friday and the revisions that just came out show a lot of jobs disappearing. It's not a stronger market, and I think it gives more ammunition for the Fed to start a cutting cycle, and that's gonna give a lot of life to the economy and to the markets. Especially cyclical stocks and small-cap stocks.\"\nAccording to Lee, investors looking to buy into US equities right now would benefit greatly from a rate cut if it does come about in September. A major beneficiary of such a cut would actually be the tech sector. In this regard, Lee said the following:\n\"I think tech is still in a good place because of AI, and NVIDIA should reinforce that. It's not a demanding multiple, maybe 28x forward earnings, which is, for the best, one of the most important companies in the world, not a high multiple. So, if tech is in a good place, and then we get fed cuts, I think it allows the whole overall market to expand.\"\nConsidering the above, US markets may actually be a good place to invest for foreign investors at present, and within these markets, tech may be a good place to start. This is why we've compiled a list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors, comprising most tech companies. Our list includes some of the best American tech stocks to buy, alongside some of the top US stocks for foreigners.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nWe selected the most popular American stocks among major hedge funds to compile our list, by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter of 2024. These companies are considered to be the best US stocks to invest in today according to major institutional investors, and should thus be considered by foreign investors looking to buy into American equities.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another big tech company requiring no introduction. The main reason why this stock is so popular among customers is because it offers exceptional diversification in AI and cloud computing to its customers, making its products and services among the most popular choices for cloud users.\nIn the company's second-quarter 2024 earnings call, Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO, Andy Jassy, noted that the company's AI business has been growing dramatically, and this trend is expected to continue because of one core belief held by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). This belief is that there is no one AI tool that can rule the world. Developers and consumers working with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are thus offered diverse options in AI tools, which ensures that they get the best tool for the job when they partner with this company.\nAnother reason for the company's stellar growth and rising popularity among investors is the profitability of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Demand for AWS has been on the rise, particularly because of Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) investments in generative AI projects. This is what resulted in AWS revenues growing to 18.8% year-over-year in the second quarter.\nIn total, 308 hedge funds were long Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the second quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $65.8 billion.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Eugenia Perozo ",
        "Text": "After highlighting his concern over Amazon's alleged price cutting in India, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal clarified that he continues to support FDI in the e-commerce sector. The Indian press described the comments as \"damage control\" for the direct allegations Goyal made earlier this week.\nOn Wednesday (August 21st), at the launch of a Pahle India Foundation\u2019s report on \u2018Net Impact of E-Commerce on Employment and Consumer Welfare in India,\u2019 Goyal bluntly expressed his aversion to letting the e-commerce sector take over retail in India.\n\u201cAre we going to cause a huge social disruption with this massive growth of e-commerce? I don\u2019t see it as a matter of pride that half our market could possibly become a part of the e-commerce network ten years from now.\u201d\nGoyal singled out Amazon by name and alleged that it was bypassing the country\u2019s foreign investment laws into e-commerce. Amazon is only allowed to deal in online services when doing B2B transactions, it is not allowed to sell directly to consumers. Goyal emphasises it is a \u201cwell-thought-out strategy.\u201d\nIn 2021, a Reuters special report concluded that Amazon favoured big sellers on its platforms and used them to skirt regulations meant to protect small retailers from e-commerce giants. They revealed internal documents that urged workers to \u201ctest the boundaries of what is allowed by law.\u201d\nGoyal has cited the disappearance of mom-and-pop stores in the US as a cautionary tale that India should learn from. Between 2007 and 2017, the number of small retailers in the US fell by 65,000. 40% of the country's small apparel, toy and sporting goods makers were wiped from the market.\nIf a similar thing were to happen in India, it would be far more disruptive given the country\u2019s large informal sector of the economy. There are an estimated 100 million small retailers in the country that could be affected.\nWhile Goyal worries about how Amazon\u2019s presence will affect the country\u2019s local economy, the company already has announced long-term investment plans in India. The rift comes as the government is evaluating a new policy that would target unethical trading practices in the e-commerce sector.\nIn June 2023, Amazon said they plan to increase investments in the country to $26bn by 2030, including for its cloud business. The firm also plans to target $20bn worth of merchandise exports by 2025. It recently announced a data centre in Hyderabad that will develop artificial intelligence and machine learning services.\nIndia must strike a balance between a regulatory environment that is attractive to investors and one that protects the local economy and its consumers.\n\"Indian minister warns of Amazon\u2019s price cutting, calls for fairness in FDI\" was originally created and published by Investment Monitor, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

It also claimed that many AI use cases are \u201cnever going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.\u201d The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver \u201cvalue commensurate with the hype\u201d.\nThe $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are \u201cfew real uses\u201d of AI other than \u201csummarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding\u201d.\nElliott Management said in its letter that it stayed away from \u201cbubble\u201d stocks included in the Magnificicient Seven group.\nElliott Management last year posted a modest gain of 4.7%. However, it has a record of no down years since the financial crisis in 2008. Since its inception in 1977, the fund has reported just two down years, a feat hard to match in the hedge fund industry.\nWhile Elliott calling mega-cap AI stocks a bubble is a major development, it\u2019s certainly not a surprise. Many investors and market experts have been warning about the hype around major AI stocks.\nHere is what Insider Monkey\u2019s founder and Research Director Inan Dogan said about Elliott Management\u2019s latest thoughts on AI stocks:\n\u201cI have been saying that NVDA\u2019s market cap assumes that the company will make around $150 billion in profits perpetually which is crazy. Elliott is saying the same thing and it is becoming news! Investors don\u2019t know how to bet on the AI revolution, so the only visible companies that they think will benefit are semiconductor and cloud companies. That\u2019s why they have been piling into NVDA. It doesn\u2019t mean that other tech companies are in a bubble territory. In contrast, if Elliott is right that other megacaps are overspending on NVDA chips right now, this implies that their earnings are understated and they are actually much more profitable and cheaper than Elliott thinks. That\u2019s why NVDA and cloud companies are in different categories. NVDA could be in bubble territory but I am not sure other megacaps in the Magnificient Seven group are in a bubble.\u201d\nFor this article, we analyzed the top AI stocks in the Mag. 7 group which according to Paul Singer are in a bubble. We also talked about three AI/tech stocks that were in Singer\u2019s portfolio, as of the end of the first quarter of this year. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\nAmazon is an important part of the Mag. 7 group of stocks which Paul Singer believes might be in a bubble.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares fell as investors digested the company\u2019s latest quarterly report where revenue missed estimates and guidance came in soft despite AWS growth.\nAWS\u2019s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He\u2019s Buying.

        "Title": "ATSG takes profit hit as Amazon returns leased freighters",
        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "Fewer flight hours by airline units and the scheduled return of Boeing 767-200 freighters from expiring leases pushed down second-quarter revenue by 15.3% at Air Transport Services Group. Those factors caused a 17% drop in adjusted earnings, the company reported after the market\u2019s close on Thursday, but results exceeded analysts expectations.\nThe diversified lessor and operator of freighter aircraft said adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization fell 17% year over year to $130.4 million on revenue of $448.4 million. Many of the 767-200s, which are older and less efficient than 767-300s, were returned by primary customer Amazon.\nWilmington, Ohio-based Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG) said the disappointing results were better than internal projections. It raised full-year guidance on expectations of improved performance in the second half of the year, when freight volumes are typically higher. Initial market sentiment seems to agree with that assessment, with the company\u2019s stock trading 5% higher at $13.95 per share in aftermarket trading. Adjusted earnings per share of 19 cents was 3 cents above the consensus on Wall Street, primarily due to better margins in leasing.\nThe second half also promises to be better because Amazon is providing 10 Boeing 767-300 freighters between June and December for subsidiary ABX Air to operate for five years, under a recent agreement. Amazon is pulling the aircraft from Atlas Air Worldwide\u2019s cargo airline for ABX to operate on its behalf but continues to lease the aircraft from Atlas\u2019 Titan Aviation Leasing. ABX is already flying three of the aircraft. The agreement means ATSG will operate 51 medium-size 767 freighters for Amazon by the end of the year, including 30 owned and leased by ATSG.\nThe company now expects adjusted EBITDA to be about $526 million in 2024, up $10 million from the previous outlook issued in May because of four aircraft leases that commenced in the third quarter and increased flying for Amazon.\n\u201cWe expect contracted pricing increases and seasonal charter opportunities in the fourth quarter, which should drive improved sequential results in our [lease-plus flight services] segment,\u201d said CEO Mike Berger. \u201cThis expected improvement, combined with momentum in our core leasing business, positions us well to drive earnings growth in 2025. We are ahead of our target for positive free cash flow for the year, with $107 million generated in the first half and an expectation to add to that total in the second half.\u201d\nATSG announced Thursday it has leased a Boeing 767-300 freighter to SLG Worldwide, an air charter service provider in New York that will sublease the aircraft to Euroavia Airlines. The Larnaca, Cyprus-based airline said the new capacity will help it meet growing demand in Eurasia and the Middle East.\nLate last month, ATSG\u2019s leasing arm Cargo Aircraft Management (CAM) delivered two Boeing 767-300 aircraft to Georgian Airways \u2013 a passenger aircraft and a freighter that recently was converted from passenger configuration. Georgian Airways leased its first 767 freighter from ATSG last year. Georgian Airways home base in Tbilisi, Georgia, is a natural refueling and transfer location for goods moving out of China to Europe, the Middle East and Southeast Asia.\nOn Wednesday, ATSG promoted Todd France to chief commercial officer after serving since December 2022 as president of the company\u2019s aircraft leasing subsidiary, Cargo Aircraft Management. Prior to that he was president of ATSG\u2019s maintenance unit, Airborne Maintenance & Engineering Services.\nATSG has gone through a series of leadership changes since early November, when Rich Corrado was terminated for weak earnings and a deflated stock price during a pronounced downturn in freight markets. He was replaced by then- Executive Chairman and former CEO Joe Hete, who turned over the company\u2019s day-to-day management to Mike Berger and returned to his board role in June. Berger had been upgraded from chief strategy officer to president in October. Berger was replaced as president by board member Jeffrey Dominick.\n\u201cATSG\u2019s fleet of predominantly mid-sized freighters is well-suited to the requirements of the express and e-commerce sectors. Despite near-term headwinds, the worst should be behind the stock. We expect that as the company starts outperforming low expectations, valuation should grind higher,\u201d said Stifel equity analyst Frank Galanti in a client note.\nLeasing unit revenues declined 7% for the second quarter behind the return of nine 767-200 and four 767-300s, more than offsetting the gain from 14 new freighter leases since last summer. The returned aircraft also cut into revenue generated from engine maintenance prices based on the number of hours utilized. ATSG has 87 aircraft on lease to external customers, one more than a year ago. Another 23 aircraft are in, or awaiting, conversion to freighters \u2013 six fewer than the end of the second quarter in 2023. Two Airbus A330 aircraft are expected to complete conversion and be leased to an external customer in the fourth quarter, the company said.\u00a0It is optimistic about future leases of other aircraft.\nATSG operates three airlines \u2013 two cargo and one passenger \u2013 that provide outsourced airlift under contract with Amazon, DHL Express and the U.S. military. The transportation side of the business suffered a pretax loss of $7 million compared to earnings of $24 million in the prior year. Cargo flight hours decreased 11% year over year, reflecting the removal from service of certain 767-200s that customers leased and hired ATSG to fly on their behalf.\nThe diversified aviation company also lowered its outlook for capital spending to $390 million from the $410 million estimated in May \u2013 and down $400 million from 2023 actual spending. The company has dialed back investments in aircraft purchases and conversion over the past year as the market cooled off and investors got upset about not receiving higher returns.\nManagement said it expects adjusted EBITDA this quarter to be similar to the second quarter as ramp-up costs for adding the 10 Amazon-supplied 767 freighters continue, but that costs will be higher in the fourth quarter when the last few planes enter service and other peak-season operations occur.\nATSG has 134 aircraft in service, including 20 passenger planes. There are seven more freighters than a year ago. The total includes straight leases to other airlines, leased aircraft bundled with a service agreement that includes crews, maintenance and insurance, and aircraft provided by customers like Amazon.\nThree of the returned 767-200s will be used as spares to support future surges in Amazon shipping demand, Berger said during a briefing with analysts.\nAmazon owns 19.5% of ATSG after exercising warrants in 2021.\nMeanwhile, pilots at ATSG cargo airline Air Transport International complained about the company\u2019s \u201cunwillingness\u201d to agree to a market-based contract, which they said will likely damage its reputation for reliable service as more experienced pilots continue to leave.\n\u201cATI and ATSG owe it to their largest customer, Amazon, to restore ATI as a strong, growing airline ready to support Amazon Air\u2019s current and future needs,\u201d the pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, said in a statement this week.\nThe lack of a pay raise in three years is contributing to pilot resignations and forced the airline to upgrade first officers to captains sooner than normal, the statement continued. Similar union pressure tactics around previous financial results have not met with success as talks, which have been underway for years, remain under federal mediation.\nClick here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.\nTwitter: @ericreports / LinkedIn: Eric Kulisch / ekulisch@freightwaves.com\nRELATED READING:\nUzbek airline My Freighter adds 2 more Boeing 767s\u00a0\nAmazon transferring Boeing 737-800 cargo jets to Sun Country Airlines\nThe post ATSG takes profit hit as Amazon returns leased freighters appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Author": "  Azure Gilman, Emma Burleigh ",
        "Text": "Good morning!\nThere are few companies that have created cultures as all-consuming as Amazon.\nAmazonians are famous for their six-page memos. They have a \u201ctwo-pizza rule\u201d that defines how small certain teams should be based on how much they need for a meal. But perhaps most importantly, they have 16 leadership principles. These range from \u201cCustomer obsession,\u201d to \u201cBias for action,\u201d to \u201cDisagree and commit,\u201d but they\u2019ve all been encoded into the company\u2019s DNA for decades.\nThe upside is a company-wide understanding of mission, and a \u201cgranular level\u201d knowledge up and down the corporate ladder about how things work within the company. The downside is a corporate culture that borders on fanaticism, with the occasional weaponization of principles to the detriment of people and groups with less power.\nBut what was once an agreed-upon set of rules permeating every facet of company life has shown signs of fraying, writes my colleague Jason Del Rey in a new feature. Not only have they become more diluted, but many managers say the focus has shifted away from guiding good work, and more towards criticizing fellow employees.\nThe source of the change can be traced in part to the pandemic. Amazon did booming business during the height of COVID, doubling its headcount within two years, and hiring new executives from outside. These managers were introduced to company culture via Zoom rather than in-person gatherings, and were less familiar\u2014as well as devoted\u2014to the company\u2019s old-school culture.\nThe differences are noticeable. There are now PowerPoint presentations at times in place of the famous six-pagers. One VP has directed her team to begin with a one-page memo, and increase it to six as needed. And when Amazon was in the spotlight during the massive unionization efforts of warehouse workers, and sued by the FTC for alleged antitrust activity, the company\u2019s attempt to add two more principles went over like a lead balloon: \u201cStrive to be the Earth\u2019s best employer,\u201d and \u201cSuccess and scale bring broad responsibility.\u201d\n\u201cThey are clearly a marketing ploy and they devalue the rest of the Leadership Principles,\u201d one former senior manager of more than 10 years who left the company recently told Fortune.\nCEO Andy Jassy recently released an hour-long video explaining the principles. But the issue begs a larger question: Should companies stay true to their original playbook, or are they only useful to management during a certain period of time?\n\u201cThe company has shifted and grown,\u201d says Beryl Tomay, the VP of Amazon\u2019s transportation division. \u201cSo you have to keep adapting.\u201d\nAzure Gilman azure.gilman@fortune.com\nToday's edition was curated by Emma Burleigh.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Owlet Announces Strong Second Quarter 2024 Results, Achieves Record-Breaking Amazon Prime Day",
        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "LEHI, Utah, August 12, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Owlet, Inc. (\"Owlet\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:OWLT), the pioneer of smart infant monitoring, today reports financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. Owlet\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder, Kurt Workman, President and Chief Revenue Officer, Jonathan Harris, and Chief Financial Officer, Amanda Twede Crawford, will host a conference call to review the Company\u2019s results and provide a business update today, August 12, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET.\nQ2 2024 Financial Highlights:\nObtained CE Medical certification for UK and Europe, launching Dream Sock across major European markets.\nQ2 Revenue was approximately $20.7 million, up approximately 58% year over year.\nQ2 Gross Margin was approximately 50%, up approximately 1,000 basis points year over year.\nQ2 Net Loss was approximately ($1.1) million, improving approximately 85% compared to Net Loss of approximately ($8.5) million year over year.\nQ2 adjusted EBITDA was approximately $0.1 million compared to adjusted EBITDA loss of ($4.3) million in the same prior year period.\n\"Owlet\u2019s results in the first half of 2024 give us added confidence that this year is a turning point for our company. We have delivered strong, double-digit revenue and sell-through growth as we advance our vision to make Owlet the most trusted infant health monitoring ecosystem. Along with our excellent commercial progress, we have continued to streamline our business to achieve improved gross margins and significantly lower operating expenses, which in turn drove improved Adjusted EBITDA and a clear path to Adjusted EBITDA breakeven exiting 2024,\" said Kurt Workman, Owlet\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder.\nWorkman continued, \"While pleased with our advancements across our business, we are not resting and plan to continually lay the regulatory groundwork for additional commercial expansion in both our home US market and abroad. A prime example of this comes on the heels of our groundbreaking FDA clearances in 2023, and during the quarter, we announced medical certification and product introductions in both the UK and EU markets. In short order, we have dramatically expanded our market access at a time when we have resumed our top line growth trajectory. Further, we kicked off Q3 with record-breaking results for Prime Day on both Amazon and OwletCare.com. We see Owlet as being well-positioned for long-term success, and I'm excited to lead our dynamic company into the next phase of its growth.\"\nFinancial Results for the Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2024Revenues for the second quarter of 2024 were approximately $20.7 million compared to revenue in the second quarter of 2023 of approximately $13.1 million. The increase was primarily due to higher sales of Dream Sock products, reflecting an increase in consumer demand across all sales channels as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nCost of revenues for the second quarter of 2024 was approximately $10.4 million with a gross margin of approximately 50%. Gross margin increased year over year primarily due to higher revenue and lower direct product and fulfillment costs.\nOperating expenses, including stock-based compensation, were approximately $12.5 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to approximately $11.9 million for the same period in 2023.\nOperating loss was approximately $2.2 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to approximately $6.7 million for the second quarter of 2023. The year-over-year decrease was driven primarily by increased revenue and margin expansion.\nNet loss was approximately ($1.1) million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to net loss of approximately ($8.5) million for the second quarter of 2023. Improved net loss in the second quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by Owlet demonstrating stronger operating results year over year.\nIn the second quarter of 2024 there was a decrease in the fair value of common stock warrants outstanding, resulting in a gain of approximately $1.0 million as compared to a loss of approximately ($1.6) million in the second quarter of 2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA was approximately $0.1 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to a loss of approximately ($4.3) million for the second quarter of 2023.\nNet loss per share was ($0.30) for the second quarter of 2024, compared to net loss per share of ($1.19) for the second quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income per share was $0.00 for the second quarter of 2024, compared to adjusted net loss per share of ($0.56) for the same period in 2023.\nFinancial OutlookFor the second half of 2024, we are estimating net revenue to be in the range of $37 million to $42 million, gross margins of 46% to 50%, and Adjusted EBITDA loss of ($3) million to break-even.\nFor FY 2024, we are estimating net revenue to be in the range of $72.5 million to $77.5 million, gross margins of 47% to 49%, and Adjusted EBITDA loss of ($6) million to ($3) million.\nForward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \"Reform Act\"). All statements contained in this press release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the Company\u2019s expected financial performance, including the Company\u2019s financial outlook, outlook based upon regulatory authorizations or product enhancements, growth prospects, and future operational efficiencies or results and expected market opportunity and acceptance.

All such forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or any person acting on the Company\u2019s behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to above. Moreover, the Company operates in an evolving environment. Except as required by law, the Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this press release, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, although Owlet may do so from time to time. The Company does not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties.\nDisclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), the Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share.\nThe Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures as internal measures of business operating performance and as performance measures for benchmarking against the Company\u2019s peers and competitors. The Company believes its presentation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of the Company\u2019s current business and enables investors to better understand and evaluate its historical and prospective operating performance. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they exclude items that vary from period to period without correlation to the Company\u2019s core operating performance and highlight trends in its business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Due to the nature of the items being excluded, such items do not reflect future gains, losses, expenses or benefits and are not indicative of the Company\u2019s future operating performance. The Company believes investors, analysts and other interested parties use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share in evaluating issuers, and the presentation of these measures facilitates a comparative assessment of the Company\u2019s operating performance in addition to the Company\u2019s performance based on GAAP results.\nThe Company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or net loss per share as a measure of financial performance or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and should not be construed as an inference that the Company\u2019s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nEBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted for income tax provision and interest expense, net and depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted for income tax provision, interest expense, interest expense from contingent beneficial conversion feature, interest income, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, warrant liability adjustments, gain on loan forgiveness, stock-based compensation, and transaction costs.\nAdjusted net loss is defined as net loss adjusted for restructuring costs, common stock warrant liability adjustments, stock-based compensation, and transaction costs. Adjusted net loss per share is defined as adjusted net loss divided by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are not recognized terms under GAAP, and the Company\u2019s presentation of these non-GAAP measures does not replace the presentation of the Company\u2019s financial results in accordance with GAAP. Because all companies do not use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share (and similarly titled financial measures) in the same way, those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the Company calculates such measures. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this release should not be construed as substitutes for or better indicators of the Company\u2019s performance than the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. See the reconciliation tables that accompany this release for additional information regarding certain of the non-GAAP financial measures included herein.\nA reconciliation of the Company's guidance with respect to non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts and is not provided herein because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, the amounts of which could be material.\nConference Call and Webcast InformationOwlet will host a conference call and audio webcast today, August 12, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss these results.\nTo access the conference call by telephone, please dial (833) 470-1428 (domestic) or +1 (404) 975-4839 (international) and reference Access Code 458341.

        "Title": "If You Like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet, You Might Love This Growth Stock",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are very different companies, but they are the top three players in the fast-growing cloud computing industry.\nThey offer hundreds of cloud services to businesses, from simple data storage to complex software development tools. More recently, they have invested heavily in new data centers filled with powerful graphics processors (GPUs) from the likes of Nvidia, and they rent the computing power to artificial intelligence (AI) developers. This could be one of the most valuable opportunities in the history of the cloud industry.\nMicrosoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are locked in a fierce battle for AI market share. DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN), on the other hand, has carved out a lucrative niche by only serving small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs), which are often overlooked by its trillion-dollar competitors. DigitalOcean stock looks like a great value, and here's why investors might want to buy it right now.\nThe cloud leaders typically focus on serving large organizations because they have the highest budgets, whereas SMBs receive less attention. DigitalOcean targets those customers exclusively, whether they are in the start-up phase or they have up to 500 employees.\nDigitalOcean provides them with highly personalized service, clear and transparent pricing, and cloud tools that are simple to deploy, because the company knows most of its customers can't afford in-house technical teams.\nDigitalOcean is now using that blueprint to deliver affordable AI solutions to customers. Right now, cloud leaders let their largest customers access tens of thousands of GPUs worth of computing capacity, which means developers with significant financial resources are building the most advanced AI models. Smaller companies simply can't compete.\nDigitalOcean recently announced it will allow its customers to access small numbers of AI GPUs (typically between one and eight), including Nvidia's flagship H100, to integrate AI into their workflows at a scale that suits them. CEO Paddy Srinivasan says this fractional on-demand access to GPUs is a first of its kind for the industry, and it helps democratize access to AI.\nThe company will also open a new state-of-the-art data center in Atlanta in early 2025 that will expand its AI compute capacity. It adds to the capacity DigitalOcean acquired when it bought Paperspace last year, which is a specialist in delivering AI data center infrastructure at affordable rates.\nIn fact, Paperspace is up to 70% cheaper than cloud leaders like Microsoft Azure when it comes to AI compute capacity, because it offers per-second billing to reduce wastage, and it doesn't lock customers into contracts. Plus, it has a leaner cost structure because it offers a narrow set of services, and it passes those savings on to the customer.\nDigitalOcean generated a record $192.5 million in revenue during the second quarter of 2024 (ended June 30), which was a 13% increase from the year-ago period. It marked the second consecutive quarterly growth acceleration.\nThe company was regularly growing its top line by more than 30% each quarter just two years ago, so it has slowed considerably overall. One reason is that DigitalOcean is currently slashing costs in order to boost its profitability. During Q2, the company had total operating expenses of $95 million, which was an 8.5% reduction from the year-ago period.\nThat resulted in $19.1 million in net income, a whopping 2,777% increase.\nThe fact DigitalOcean managed to accelerate its revenue growth while cutting costs and generating a healthy profit really speaks to the organic demand for its cloud services.\nPlus, here's something investors should keep an eye on in the coming quarters. DigitalOcean said its revenue attributable to AI, specifically, soared by a staggering 200% year over year in Q2. The company didn't disclose how much revenue it actually generated from its AI services (including Paperspace), so we can assume that growth was from a very low baseline number -- but it still signals surging demand.\nAccording to an estimate by Grand View Research, the cloud industry overall will be worth around $730 billion this year. The SMB segment alone could be worth $114 billion according to DigitalOcean, but the company expects it to grow by 23% annually going forward compared to just 21.2% for the cloud industry overall.\nDigitalOcean's strategy to deliver affordable AI infrastructure and services could add a new dimension to that opportunity, because it's penetrating a brand new market that has been underserved by other providers. Global consulting firm PwC thinks AI will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, so it's easily the largest financial opportunity DigitalOcean has faced to date.\nDigitalOcean stock is currently trading 75% below its all-time high that was set during the tech frenzy in 2021. It was overvalued back then with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of around 30, but the company has grown its revenue consistently ever since, and its P/S ratio now stands at just 4.1.\nThat's more than a 50% discount to its average P/S ratio of 8.8 going back to when the company came public in 2021:\nSimply put, DigitalOcean stock looks like a good value right now. Combine that with the company's accelerating revenue growth, surging profitability, and enormous opportunities in the cloud and AI industries, and investors could do well to start buying.\nBefore you buy stock in DigitalOcean, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and DigitalOcean wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. That's why when we briefly looked at Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Amazon.com:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.14 = US$54b \u00f7 (US$555b - US$158b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThus, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 14%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 12% generated by the Multiline Retail industry.\n Check out our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nIn the above chart we have measured Amazon.com's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Amazon.com  for free.\nWhile the returns on capital are good, they haven't moved much. The company has consistently earned 14% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 226% in that time. Since 14% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.\nTo sum it up, Amazon.com has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\nAmazon.com could be trading at an attractive price in other respects, so you might find our  free intrinsic value estimation for AMZN  on our platform quite valuable.\nWhile Amazon.com may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

        "Text": "By Aishwarya Venugopal and Siddharth Cavale\n(Reuters) -Walmart's \"Everyday Low Price\" promise will be put to the test when it reports quarterly results, after rival Amazon.com's warning that customers had turned bargain hunters, pressuring the online shopping behemoth to forecast a weak current quarter.\nMajor retailers including Target, sector bellwether Walmart and Kroger have been pushing to keep prices on essentials low as many Americans shun big-ticket spending and turn to discount shopping in the face of sticky inflation.\nWhile this has strained margins across the industry, Walmart's scale gives it more negotiating power with vendors. Its low prices could end up attracting shoppers who shun more high-priced shops, some analysts said.\n\"(Amazon's result) has sent a chill through the wider retail sector. That said, for a value-focused retailer like Walmart, performance may be better as its offers are more centered around essential products,\" Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData said.\nWall Street expects Walmart, due to report second-quarter results on Aug. 15, to post a 4% rise in quarterly revenue, according to LSEG, the slowest rate of growth in nearly two years.\n\"There's a generalized slowdown in the consumer. Its numbers are going to come within guidance. We are not going to see Walmart all of a sudden pop up,\" said Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager at F/m Investments, which holds Amazon shares and has previously invested in Walmart, Target and Costco.\nWalmart expects sales in the quarter ended July to increase between 3.5% and 4.5%.\nTarget and Kroger are set to report quarterly results after their larger Bentonville, Arkansas-based rival.\nAmazon on Thursday reported slowing online sales growth in the second quarter and said consumers were seeking out cheaper options for purchases leading it to forecast current quarter revenue below expectations.\n\"Consumers are being careful with their spend, trading down, looking for lower average selling price products, looking for deals. That continued into the second quarter, and we expect it to continue into the third quarter,\" Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a post-earnings call.\nResults from major consumer packaged goods companies including Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo also show signs of a slowdown.\nP&G reported a surprise drop in quarterly sales and PepsiCo missed expectations.\n\"There's weakness in consumer discretionary, and no retail or e-commerce player is immune to that,\" John Tomlinson, analyst at research firm M Science said.\nWhile Amazon saw a trade down to cheaper items, it didn't extend to unit sales, which is a good sign for Walmart, said Dave Wagner, head of equities at Aptus Capital Advisors, which holds about $150 million shares in both Amazon and Walmart.\nWalmart is well positioned with better inventory control than rival dollar stores and a wide product selection that makes it an attractive shopping destination, Wagner said. Coupled with efforts to grow its Walmart+ membership program, current capital on its balance sheet and investments in automation, Walmart is on a good footing in this environment, he added.\nThe second quarter does tend to be leaner for retailers, with sales ramping up in the second half of the year with back-to-school and holiday season demand.\nShares of Walmart and Amazon have outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year, rising 33% and 21% respectively, compared to a 14% gain in the broader index. Amazon shares sank 12% on Friday, dragging Walmart down about 2%.\n(Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal and Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Nivedita Bhattacharjee, Kirsten Donovan)\n"

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): An Important AI Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other important AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence has led to a much-needed market rally in the technology industry over the past year. The benchmark S&P 500, dominated by tech giants, is up nearly 20% in the past year. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite is up over 21%. In light of easing inflation numbers and rate cuts, market analysts had forecast a jump in interest around growth options for 2024. However, the AI buzz has served to snowball this ordinary interest into an extraordinary wave of optimism around the whole economy. Although tech stocks have been the biggest beneficiary, there is little doubt that AI will soon penetrate other sectors of the economy, from manufacturing and supply chain, to transportation, entertainment, and retail.\nThere are numbers that illustrate this argument in quantifiable terms. Across the economic spectrum, investments in AI are increasing at a rapid pace. For example, according to a recent report on the AI industry by renowned investment bank Goldman Sachs, established businesses around the world are expected to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years. Investments in AI startups are also booming. So far in 2024, venture capital firms have made around 200 deals with AI firms, investing nearly $22 billion. The average size of a round of funding for AI startups is more than $100 million with an average valuation of more than $1 billion. In contrast, these numbers for non-AI startups are $20 million and $200 million.\nKey players who were early to catch on to the AI trend have leapfrogged competitors. Stocks of companies that make graphics processing units (GPUs), specialized AI chips, and generative AI products have soared. In general, the median returns of AI-linked firms on the S&P 500 are 20% compared to 2% for non-AI stocks. On the NASDAQ Composite, AI firms are responsible for 90% of the overall returns on the border index. Analysts expect these gains to translate into earnings and GDP growth. Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, argues that in the next ten years, AI is likely to automate 25% of all work tasks and raise US productivity by 9% and GDP growth by more than 6%.\nResearch presented in the keynote address to the 2024 EMW Conference by Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management suggests that these gains may be the beginning of a new super cycle for the tech industry, following previous cycles such as PCs in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s that led to the popularity of the cloud. However, investors have more reason to be optimistic about this growth since it compares favorably to cycles of the past. Software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan contend that tech companies seem to be investing in AI products by tying the spending to the revenues, ensuring a safety net that had not existed in previous cycles.\nSince the beginning of the AI wave in early 2023 following the launch of ChatGPT by California-based Open AI, the focus of the industry has shifted from software towards AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure firms have added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since the first quarter of 2023. Before a killer AI application can emerge or large scale AI automation can begin - Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist at MIT, predicts this will take more than a decade - new areas of AI infrastructure are emerging. These include utilities, energy, internet, and industrials (see 20 Industrial Stocks That Are Already Riding the AI Wave). The gains of prominent utility, industrial, energy, and internet firms critical to AI development rival the returns of traditional AI stocks.\nInvestments in energy and utilities are important if this AI potential is to be realized. Goldman analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect the proliferation of AI technology and the accompanying need to maintain data centers to drive an increase in demand for utilities that has not been seen in a generation. It remains to be seen, however, if the pace at which AI is progressing will keep pace with investments in power. This is because the utilities sector is highly regulated and has supply chain constraints that will not be easily overcome. If investments are made at the levels needed, it might still be a few years before their full benefits make their way towards AI firms.\nAll this hullabaloo around AI has investors on edge, with ghosts of previous bubbles haunting their memories. Although comparisons to the past are the surest way of finding your footing in unfamiliar territory, data shows that this may not be the wisest strategy considering present market dynamics. For example, at the height of the dotcom bubble just before the turn of the millennium, some software firms were trading at 132x their earnings. The five-year average for this value in 1999 was only 37x. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks were trading at P/E multiples of around 39x. The five-year average for this last year was 40x, showcasing why AI valuations may not be overextended.\nIndeed, AI firms can target multi-trillion dollar valuations, in line with some of the biggest software and internet firms on the market presently. That is the revolutionary power of AI technology. Over the past decade, tech giants have achieved a scale that few other businesses have before them. By combining billions in users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income, these handful of firms have reached 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. They are category leaders in fields such as smartphones, ecommerce, cloud, and software as a service (SaaS) - all of which AI promises to disrupt - and ahead of competitors in research and development spending. This is why many of these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business models, in hopes of holding onto their thrones.\nSome investors remain concerned about AI firms bullying software companies on the market in the near and long term. A cursory glance at the Price-to-Sale (PS) ratios for software stocks in the past decade reveals that after topping out in 2021, the valuations for SaaS firms are near their all time lows. Some of this pessimism around software can also be attributed to slower earnings growth. Coatue research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS stocks expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% at the peak of the Saas craze. As the future of human-machine interaction moves towards communication in natural language, software firms who adapt to AI changes are more likely to survive than those that do not.\nAs the markets become decoupled from rate hikes, inflation figures go down, and the prospects of a soft landing become brighter, the macro outlook for AI looks favorable as well. The main driver for future S&P 500 growth in terms of earnings remains AI. According to Coatue research, in the next three years, AI-linked stocks will grow at a compound annual rate of almost 20%, beating their non-AI counterparts by nearly 14 percentage points. 40% of the earnings from tech will be accelerated by AI tailwinds in the period. All indicators point towards a brighter future for AI investors in the long term.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI infrastructure stocks with more than 25% gains in 2024 that are also popular among hedge funds. These are the best AI stocks to buy according to the market participants and hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\u00a0\nYTD Return as of August 1: 30%\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Contrary to public opinion, the company is investing heavily in incorporating AI into the tools it already markets, in line with efforts of competitors like Google and Microsoft. AI tools can improve the user experience on software offerings of these firms, enabling instant responses and pictorial representations of complex queries and prompts. In mid-July, the company announced that it would be adding more memory to so-called virtual agents that automate work for businesses. This would allow users to build on new requests with AI-enabled processing of prior ones.\nAndrew Jassy, the CEO of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), said during the second quarter earnings call that the firm had invested in custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. The firm has an eye on generative AI as it develops these chips. He added that the second versions of those chips with Trainium coming later this year were very compelling on price performance.\nOverall AMZN ranks 28th on our list of the most important AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Walmart, Home Depot, Target and Amazon are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 12, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Walmart WMT, Home Depot HD, Target TGT and Amazon AMZN.\nWalmart shares held their own in the market\u2019s recent turmoil, cementing its anchoring and defensive positioning. With the company on deck to report quarterly results on Thursday, August 15th, Walmart\u2019s results will provide us with an important window into the health of the consumer economy. Worries about the economy and recession risks were a big driver of the market sell-off.\nThis week also brings quarterly results from Home Depot on Tuesday, August 13th. But Home Depot is primarily a housing play, which has been struggling lately due to higher mortgage rates.\nIn addition to Walmart and Home Depot, we will also get the July inflation and Retail Sales readings, with the CPI report coming on Wednesday, August 14th, and the Retail Sales report the same morning as Walmart\u2019s release (Thursday).\nThe inflation report has been the market\u2019s primary preoccupation in recent months, given its significance to the coming Fed easing that is widely expected to get underway in September. In the wake of the recent market turmoil, many expect that the central bank will opt for a bigger magnitude of cut at the September meeting than would have been the case otherwise.\nThe inflation trend has been favorable over the last couple of months after coming out on the hot side in the first few months of the year. The Retail Sales reading will most likely get much more scrutiny this time, given the market\u2019s focus on the economy\u2019s growth momentum, which has notably eased in recent months.\nGetting back to Walmart\u2019s quarterly release, please see below how Walmart shares performed relative to the Home Depot, the S&P 500 index, and the Magnificent 7 stocks.\nWalmart\u2019s defensive attributes reflect the retailer\u2019s heavy grocery exposure and reputation for value. Walmart\u2019s value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households.\nWalmart\u2019s growing share of higher-income grocery spending notwithstanding, the retailer still has a substantial exposure to lower-income consumers, who appear to be under growing stress, as reflected in rising loan delinquency rates and other measures indicating strained financial health. This exposure could be a source of vulnerability for Walmart\u2019s same-store sales in its quarterly release.\nWalmart is expected to report $0.65 in EPS on $168.4 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +6.6% and +4.2%, respectively. Trends in Walmart\u2019s non-grocery business have been anemic lately, though management had pointed to some early signs of stabilization in a few discretionary product categories at the last earnings call. Any favorable turn in the demand trends for the retailer\u2019s discretionary merchandise will be a nice offset to the aforementioned lower-income vulnerability. Any signs of life on the discretionary merchandise part will also have positive read-throughs for Target.\nThe chart below uses a longer time span than the four-week period we used earlier, with the one-year performance of Walmart relative to Home Depot, Mag 7, and the S&P 500 index.\nWalmart shares were up big following the last quarterly release on May 15th, which was the second quarter in a row of market participants cheering the retailer\u2019s quarterly results. One relatively less noted part of Walmart\u2019s growing digital footprint is the retailer\u2019s growing advertising business. It is still a relatively small part of Walmart\u2019s total revenues, but this revenue stream is growing fast and enjoys a much higher margin.\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q2 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 23 of the 36 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification.\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Home Depot, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 23 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q2 results already belong to the e-commerce and restaurant industries.\nTotal Q2 earnings for these 23 retailers that have reported are up +26.2% from the same period last year on +6.1% higher revenues, with 52.2% beating EPS estimates and only 34.8% beating revenue estimates.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.\nAs you can see above, the online players and restaurant operators have struggled with beating EPS and revenue estimates in Q2. In fact, Q2 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players represent a new low over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years).\nWith respect to the elevated earnings rate at this stage, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 23 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q2 earnings were up +99.8% on +10.1% higher revenues, as it beat on EPS but missed top- line expectations.\nAs we all know, digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart\u2019s results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the COVID lockdowns.\nThe two comparison charts below show the Q2 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon\u2019s results (left side chart) and without Amazon\u2019s numbers (right side chart)\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\nWe will hear more about issues on the Q2 earnings calls, as we did from Amazon, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, August 2nd, we have seen Q2 results from 456 S&P 500 members, or 91.2% of the index\u2019s membership. Total earnings for these index members are up +9.1% from the same period last year on +5.3% higher revenues, with 79.6% beating EPS estimates and only 59% able to beat revenue estimates.\nPlenty of Q2 results are still to come, even though we have seen results from more than 90% of S&P 500 members already. This week brings in results from more than 400 companies, including 8 S&P 500 members. The notable companies on deck to report results this week include the aforementioned Walmart and Home Depot, Brinker International, Cisco Systems, Tapestry, Deere & Company, China\u2019s Alibaba, Applied Materials, and others.\nThe comparisons charts below put the earnings and revenue beats percentages for these companies in a historical context.\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 59% is a new low for this group of index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years). Revenue beats have been low from the start of the reporting cycle, a trend that will carry through to the end of the earnings season.\nThe comparison charts below put the Q2 earnings and revenue growth rates for these companies in a historical context.\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues.\nThis is the highest earnings growth pace in the last eight quarters since the +10% in 2022 Q1. The Q2 aggregate earnings total is on track to be a new all-time quarterly record, as the chart below shows.\nThe chart below that shows the year-over-year earnings and revenue growth for 2024 Q2 in the context of what we saw in the preceding four periods and what is currently expected for the following three periods.\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues.\nPlease note that estimates for Q3 have been steadily coming down, with the current +4.3% earnings growth rate down from +6.9% in early July.\nThis is a bigger cut to estimates relative to what we saw in the comparable periods for the preceding two quarters. The negative revisions trend is broad-based, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut since the quarter got underway. The biggest cuts have been to the Transportation, Business Services, Energy, Aerospace, and Basic Materials sectors. On the positive side, estimates for the Tech sector are going up, while the same for the Finance sector are only marginally higher relative to where we started in early July.\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.2% on +1.7% revenue growth. Excluding the Energy sector drag, whose earnings are now expected to be down -11.1% in 2024, total earnings for the rest of the index would be up +9.8%.\nThe expected 2024 revenue growth pace improves to +4.1% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +7.9% on an ex-Finance basis.\nUnlike the calendar year view that the above chart shows, the chart below the earnings data on a rolling four-quarter basis\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>A Closer Look At the Current Earnings Picture\u00a0 \nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Jim Cramer: Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Results Were \u2018Imperfect\u2019",
        "Author": "  Fahad Saleem ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks Amid Global Selloff. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer in his latest program on CNBC talked about the brutal market selloff of Monday and said days like these could make you \u201ccry yourself to sleep.\u201d Cramer said that this \u201cnasty\u201d selloff was expected.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect at this point in the rate cycle, the point where the Fed is about to start cutting rates to bolster the economy. But the economy is going down,\u201d Cramer said.\nCramer said that the Monday selloff was \u201cvicious enough\u201d to make any investor think why they should stay in the market, but that\u2019s exactly \u201cwhat you have to do.\u201d He thinks the latest decline is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.\nJim Cramer said that the selloff started because money managers who were borrowing money from Japan to invest in US stocks were caught with their \u201cpants down\u201d when Japan increased interest rates. As a result, these funds were forced to sell their stocks. He thinks it\u2019s not possible to call a bottom on this decline yet \u201cuntil we know these sellers are done unwinding their trades.\u201d\nCramer said that another key reason why investors were selling on Monday was the notion that the Fed is late on cutting rates. But Cramer said a 25 bps rate cut wouldn\u2019t have mattered a lot and if Fed Chair Jerome Powell sees there is a need for an urgent rate cut, he\u2019d do it.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got horse sense,\u201d Cramer said.\nJim Cramer said there are no \u201csafe havens\u201d in tech and while he reiterated his bullish view on some notable tech stocks, he advised investors to be ready for \u201cpain\u201d in the near term if they want to invest in technology.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t take the pain, then get the heck out of it.\u201d\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 important stocks he\u2019s talking about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\nJim Cramer said in a latest program that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) results were \u201cimperfect.\u201d Sales of Amazon were \u201clight\u201d but AWS showed strengths. Cramer thinks Amazon\u2019s revenue guidance was weak but the company has a history of guiding conservatively.\n\u201cAmazon has got to keep on spending on computing to keep up with Alphabet and more importantly Meta and Microsoft,\u201d Cramer said.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares fell as investors digested the company\u2019s latest quarterly report where revenue missed estimates and guidance came in soft despite AWS growth.\nAWS\u2019s revenue growth accelerated from 17.2% in Q1 to 18.8% in Q2, driven by a shift from on-premises infrastructure to cloud solutions and increasing demand for AI capabilities. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising segment added over $2 billion in revenue year-over-year, indicating significant potential in video advertising and opportunities within Prime Video offerings.\nLike other tech companies, fears stemming from high CapEX are keeping investors on the sidelines. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) spending is expected to rise amid broadband project Project Kuiper and AI growth. Investors are still figuring out whether AI monetization and ROI will come anytime soon. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also facing a slowdown in consumer spending, especially for higher-ticket items like electronics and computers.\nBased on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q3 guidance, its revenue growth would be 11%. The stock is trading 35x its fiscal 2025 earnings estimates set by Wall Street. This shows the stock is fairly priced and investors looking for strong growth could look elsewhere.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were\u00a0Amazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\u201d\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks Amid Global Selloff. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Amazon\u2019s delivery drones are too loud for the residents where it\u2019s testing the program",
        "Author": "  Paolo Confino ",
        "Text": "Tests for Amazon\u2019s drone delivery program have become a regular fact of life for residents of College Station, Texas.\nThe town, which is home to Texas A&M University, is the testing ground for Amazon\u2019s drone delivery program. The program started in 2022, and its main goal is to figure out how to use drones to fulfill some of the estimated 5.9 billion packages Amazon delivered in 2023. The idea, in theory at least, is that these unmanned drones would pick up an order for the usual household items and tchotchkes people order on Amazon and deposit them at their house. As CEO Andy Jassy told investors in a letter last year, the Prime Air delivery drones will eventually allow Amazon to deliver packages in under an hour. \u201cIt won\u2019t start off being available for all sizes of packages and in all locations, but we believe it\u2019ll be pervasive over time,\u201d wrote Jassy in his annual shareholder letter. \u201cThink about how the experience of ordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\u201d\nHowever, as with most matters relating to shipping logistics, the practice is much more complicated. And for the 127,000 people of College Station, the din from the drones has become a nuisance, according to CNBC.\n\u201cIt sounds like a giant hive of bees,\u201d John Case, who has lived in the town for 40 years, told CNBC. \u201cYou know it\u2019s coming because it\u2019s pretty loud.\u201d\nAnother College Station resident, Amina Alikhan, described the noise to CNBC as \u201ca fly coming by your ear over and over, and you can\u2019t make it stop.\u201d\nThe noise levels could get worse in the near future. In May, Amazon submitted a proposal to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to increase the number of drone flights from 200 per day to 469.\nIn July, in response to Amazon\u2019s proposal, College Station Mayor John Nichols wrote a letter to the FAA.\n\u201cWith the potential to increase the frequency of drone deliveries to the amount stated in Amazon Prime Air\u2019s request, residents have continued to voice their concerns to City Council that the noise levels will only get worse and will impact the enjoyment of their property,\u201d Nichols wrote in the letter.\nDuring a city council meeting in June, College Station city manager Bryan C. Woods said he conducted several tests of the drones and found their noise levels were between 47 and 61 decibels. Sixty decibels is roughly the same noise level of an office, according to a chart from Yale Environmental Health and Safety. Woods added a caveat to his findings by saying they were \u201canecdotal.\u201d\nAmazon held a Zoom call with residents of College Station, in which an executive told them the company would not renew its lease in the Texas metro and planned to move by October 2025, according to CNBC.\nAmazon spokesperson Sam Stephenson said the company takes local feedback under consideration \u201cwherever possible.\u201d Stephenson left open the possibility Amazon could move to another location. \u201cAs our program evolves, we\u2019re considering a variety of potential paths forward\u2014including the possibility of alternate sites.\u201d\nIn May, Amazon cleared a major regulatory hurdle with the FAA opening a path for it to expand its drone delivery program. The FAA approved Amazon\u2019s request to have its drones fly greater distances outside the line of sight of the person piloting it on the ground. The FAA granted Amazon\u2019s request after the company developed a technology that ensured the drones avoided collisions. Several other companies working on drone delivery systems, such as Alphabet and Walmart, have also developed similar capabilities for their drones.\nHowever, even before the noise complaints, it hasn\u2019t been entirely smooth sailing for Amazon\u2019s Prime Air program. First announced by Jeff Bezos in 2013 during a 60 Minutes interview, the initiative\u2019s progress stalled for several years. Even at the time Bezos predicted the project would take years to perfect, foreseeing numerous complexities.\n\u201cThe hard part is putting in all the redundancy, all the reliability, all the systems you need to say, \u2018Look, this thing can\u2019t land on somebody\u2019s head when they're walking around their neighborhood,\u2019\u201d Bezos told 60 Minutes. \u201cThat\u2019s not good.\u201d\nIn 2023, Prime Air hit a major setback when it was caught up in an intense round of cost cutting across the company that resulted in numerous layoffs in the division. A few months later, in August 2023, two key executives left, including the one in charge of all testing operations.\nCollege Station wasn\u2019t the only Prime Air testing site that ran into trouble by disturbing local residents. Amazon had a similar testing facility in Lockeford, Calif., a town of about 4,000 people 40 miles south of Sacramento. When news broke that Prime Air was bringing a slew of drones to town, residents reportedly contemplated shooting them down, according to the Washington Post. In April, Amazon left the town altogether, announcing it was moving drone testing to Tolleson, Ariz.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Manish Singh ",
        "Text": "Amazon is considering shifting its payments offerings in India into a standalone app, three sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch, as the e-commerce giant aims to boost usage of Amazon Pay in the country.\nAmazon Pay is currently housed within the company's primary e-commerce app in India, and lets users transfer money to individuals and merchants, pay bills, purchase insurance and travel tickets, invest in mutual funds and digital gold, and buy travel tickets.\nThe U.S. tech giant has been contemplating decoupling its payments service from the e-commerce app for about a year and intends to proceed with the plan in the coming months, two of the sources said.\nAmazon has already reached out to the NPCI for approval, another person familiar with the matter said. The company has been told that it will likely have to issue fresh UPI IDs to users, sources familiar with the situation said, something Amazon sees as a thorny requirement.\nSome executives at Amazon believe Amazon Pay is not receiving adequate attention on the e-commerce app, one source said, adding that a separate app with a singular focus could help the payments platform gain wider recognition in the country.\nThe sources requested anonymity as the discussions are confidential and ongoing. They cautioned that Amazon, grappling with many other challenges in India, may alter its plans and could still abandon the idea.\nAn Amazon spokesperson declined to comment, describing the news as speculation.\nAmazon Pay ranks sixth among apps on Unified Payments Interface, a payments network that is the most popular way Indians transact online. In July, Amazon Pay processed about 72.4 million transactions, accounting for about 0.5% of all transactions on the network, according to official data. In comparison, Walmart's PhonePe processed 6.9 billion transactions, while Google Pay handled 5.3 billion.\nAmazon isn't alone in weighing similar options in India, where China-style super app strategies haven't seen much success. Its chief Indian rival, Flipkart, late last month consolidated its fintech offerings into one vertical, two years after separating from PhonePe.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/19/amazon-considers-moving-amazon-pay-into-a-standalone-app-in-india/\n"

        "Title": "Should Investors Buy the Dip on Amazon Stock?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock immediately got slammed after the company announced second-quarter results. It fell nearly 10% the following trading day and proceeded to fall even more in the following days. Although it has partially recovered, it's still off its 2024 highs by a fairly wide margin.\nWith Amazon still down so much, I think now is an excellent opportunity to take advantage and scoop up one of the best companies on the market at a discounted price.\nAlthough Amazon fell following earnings, the reason it fell is silly, especially for long-term investors. Management guided for $144 billion to $149 billion in revenue growth, and revenue came in at $148 billion for Q2. Normally, that's good enough, but because Wall Street analysts expected $148.6 billion, investors weren't satisfied.\nAdditionally, Q3 guidance was slightly weaker than expected, as the midpoint of Amazon's revenue guidance was $156 billion versus the $158 billion analysts expected.\nWhile that may matter for investors who are trading in and out of the stock, over the long term, that guidance \"miss\" means nothing, as the core business is still strong.\nThe biggest segment and the one most people are familiar with, online stores, continued its slow growth, only increasing 6% year over year. This segment is rather mature, and that growth rate has been fairly common over the past two years. What pushed it down this quarter was consumers choosing to purchase lower-priced items.\nBut that's not the segment I'd focus on with Amazon.\nThe two best reasons to invest in Amazon are its advertising service and its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nAdvertising has been Amazon's fastest-growing segment over the past few years, and this quarter was no exception. Revenue increased by 20% year over year, although this was the slowest growth rate in two years and missed analyst expectations. Still, management was bullish on its expansion opportunities and believes it's in the early innings of this segment's growth.\nAWS picked up the slack, delivering its fastest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2022. Part of this growth can be attributed to generative artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, but the overall transition to the cloud is still ongoing.\nBoth AWS and advertising are vital to Amazon's profit picture. Although it doesn't disclose how much advertising contributes, AWS delivers 64% of the operating profit despite only accounting for 18% of revenue. As AWS outgrows most of the commerce segments, look for this division to become an even greater profit contributor.\nThis will need to continue, as Amazon still has a premium valuation.\nEven after the sell-off, the stock trades at a price of 37 times forward earnings.\nThat's a hefty premium to pay for a company that is only growing revenue at around 10%, especially considering there are many stocks that are far cheaper and growing much quicker (such as Meta Platforms or Alphabet).\nHowever, Amazon's earnings growth is expected to vastly outpace its revenue growth in the next few years.\nAs a result, you'll have to pay a slightly higher price today to own a stock that will likely maintain its premium valuation for years to come. If you can live with this, then I think Amazon represents a great buy today, as it's one of the most important companies in the global economy and is on sale from its previous highs.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Are Street Analysts Bullish on This AI Stock Now?",
        "Author": "  Fatima Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Financial Media.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other artificial intelligence stocks recommended by financial media.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has now become a technology that most people are increasingly familiar with. With AI seeping into almost every aspect of life, from the ads you see on social media apps to the autonomous driving cars many consumers are shifting to. It's not an overstatement to say that AI has become part and parcel of everyday life for every person using technology today. Considering the widespread use and application of AI technology, this area of the market has become an exciting area to invest in today.\nWith the recent big tech companies' earnings being released, many investors are wondering what role AI is playing in the tech markets today, and how it will develop. On August 2, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi joined CNBC's \"The Exchange\" to discuss this very development. Here are some of his comments:\n\"I think what's happening is two things. On the one hand, it's macroeconomy, which has been sort of turbulent for a long period of time, and it seems to be now coming to an end, where we see it on the job market and people are seeing it on inflation and the 10-year coming down and so on. On the other hand, we see AI. People are very excited, they know it's gonna absolutely change the whole world, and that huge investments have been done by the hyperscalers in AI. But for us as a company, we've been investing in data and AI for the 10 years, and you know we see a steady growth revenue and customers getting value out of it, but theres been a huge deployment of capital... I think AI is gonna be amazing, it's gonna keep providing value.\"\nGhodsi's comments clarify the market's current opinion on AI, namely that this is an area of tech that cannot be ignored and must be invested in to the maximum. However, in light of such a market opinion, many investors may be beginning to wonder whether the huge amounts of investments being made in AI are justified or whether we are merely in what some may call an \"AI bubble\" that is definitely going to burst. Considering the immense value to be found in AI, though, many investors believe that such huge deployments of capital are, in fact, justified.\nConsidering the above, it's unsurprising that several big tech companies are part of the rat race to invest in and develop AI technologies. However, one notable absence in most lists of the best AI stocks to buy that are being made by financial media reporters is that of Apple. Many investors are beginning to take note of the fact that it is lagging behind other big tech companies that are rapidly developing AI tech. On August 6, Lightshed Partners' Walter Piecyk's shared his view on the smartphone maker's AI moves on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\".\n\"I signed up as a developer for the latest development or the latest release of iOS 18. I've been using the intelligent series - not that much better... There's a lot of work that's obviously gonna be done between now and when this is formally released.

        "Author": "  Glenn Taylor ",
        "Text": "Amazon has set a date for third-party sellers to ensure their products are available in time Black Friday sales\u2014pushing the deadline up a week earlier than last year.\nAccording to a post on Amazon\u2019s seller central forum, inventory must arrive at the e-commerce giant\u2019s fulfillment centers by Oct. 19, to guarantee it is Prime badge-ready by Black Friday. Last holiday season, inventory had to be in Amazon warehouses by Oct. 26.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nAmazon CEO: 'Customers Continue to Trade Down on Price'\nGenre-Clashing Styling, Barrel Jeans, Asics Trending for Holiday and Resort\u00a0\nAmazon Now Bears Responsibility for Recall of Third-Party Items\nIn the post, Amazon recommends sending Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) inventory to fulfillment centers in August and September to ensure they have enough products in stock for the peak holiday shopping season.\nFrom there, fulfillment center teams will be focused on receiving inventory in September and October to ensure products are placed in the right fulfillment centers before the holiday season starts.\nAmazon said it would then shift its focus in November and December to processing customer orders, given it is the tech titan\u2019s busiest time of the year. The company says it has limited slots to accept shipments to its fulfillment centers during the two months.\n\u201cThis seasonal shift helps us ensure faster delivery speeds and maximizes your sales potential during the holidays,\u201d the post wrote. \u201cAlso, you may see lower estimated capacity limits for October and November. On average, the estimated capacity limits for October and November can help provide enough storage for six months of inventory.\u201d\nAmazon also offers a Capacity Monitor tool aimed at helping sellers stay up to date on the company\u2019s capacity limits. Sellers can currently view estimated capacity limits for October, and November capacity limits will be available starting August 20.\nAll date recommendations are subject to change.\nTo help sellers simplify operations and manage inventory more efficiently during the peak season, Amazon eliminated the overage fee for storage effective July 1, 2024. This means if any merchant\u2019s on-hand inventory exceeds their capacity limit, they will not incur the overage fee.\nLast year, Amazon hosted a Black Friday event starting on Nov. 17 that lasted 11 days, resulting in the sale of more than 1 billion items on the marketplace, including 500 million items from independent sellers.\nThe company has not indicated when this extended holiday sale would return in 2024.\nAmazon has continuously improved its delivery capabilities across its network over the past year, making a major rural push in 2024 a year after regionalizing its fulfillment network into eight distinct hubs. A Wall Street Journal report said Amazon has set a target to deliver to roughly 90 percent of U.S. consumers.\nAs such, the company touted its \u201cfastest Prime delivery speeds ever\u201d in a recent blog post\u2014a claim that it has been making consistently since early 2023 when the regionalization was complete.\nThe company said in the post that in the first half of 2024, Amazon cut the distance for items traveled between its U.S. sites and the customer by nearly 10 percent compared to the year prior.\nAlthough it is August, logistics companies are aiming to prepare for the onslaught of goods expected to be shipped. UPS and DHL already both announced demand surcharges for the holiday season, with the former noting that a shorter season requires more spending to help move packages efficiently. As for DHL, the company had similar rationale on spending during the season, particularly as it anticipates a flurry of packages out of Asia from e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu.\nAmazon sellers will be competing in an environment where more retailers are expected to offer shipping promotions, which could bring a hit to margins. A recent Forrester survey said 22 percent were adding shipping promotions\u2014with those promotions ranging from more days of free shipping to a lower threshold on free shipping to more products covered by free shipping.\nRoughly one-third of the respondents to the Forrester survey expect to get packages to consumers in more than five days, with another 20 percent citing a four-day window. Only two percent could do same-day or next-day\u2014an advantage Amazon sellers still have significantly over most of retail.\nAmazon\u2019s earlier inventory requests come as more shoppers are finding excuses to go holiday shopping earlier. A recent survey from user-generated content solutions provider Bazaarvoice said 23 percent of shoppers worldwide will be holiday gift shopping by August, with 37 percent plan to start by September. By October, the number will increase to 55 percent.\n"

        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "So much for retail therapy.\nAfter Amazon reported a weaker-than-expected sales outlook for the third quarter on Thursday, sending its shares down more than 7% in after-hours trading, a top company executive posited a unique cause on a call with reporters.\nAmazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said that Amazon web traffic patterns indicate that shoppers are distracted by rare, major news events\u2014such as the Olympics and the historically turbulent US presidential race, which has already included both an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden dropping from the race\u2014and are potentially deferring purchases as a result, or just skipping them altogether.\nSuch monumental news events in the past have made it \"harder to forecast,\" Olsavsky said, and company leaders are once again battling with that reality. Amazon said it was forecasting between $154 billion and $158.5 billion in revenue for the current third quarter, a range that suggests sales will likely come in below the average analyst estimate of $158.24 billion.\nRather than seeking comfort in the \"buy now\" button, it seems that shoppers are reacting to the roller-coaster news cycle by spending less.\nAmazon's revenue in the three months ended June 30 also came in slightly below expectations at $148 billion, though earnings were stronger than expected with net profit of $13.5 billion. While the number of goods \u2014 or units \u2014 sold by Amazon in the quarter was strong, customers favored items at lower price points, according to Olsavsky and CEO Andy Jassy, who made an appearance on a conference call with analysts.\nPart of that trend is due to economic worries, the executives said they believe, but there is also another factor at play. Amazon has been investing heavily in speeding up delivery times so that customers rely on the retailer more for last-minute needs like non-perishable foods and household and beauty items that typically are inexpensive compared to other categories of products like electronics or apparel. The company is winning share in consumables, but the low average cost per transaction is weighing on revenue.\nOn the bright side for the company, revenue growth inside the Amazon Web Services cloud computing business continues to reaccelerate. Sales growth in the unit accelerated to 18.8%, up from 17.1% in the first three months in the year, driven by customer spending both on Gen AI products and services as well as more traditional cloud infrastructure projects after a period of more cost-focused spending by AWS clients.\nJassy reiterated his revelation from last quarter that Gen AI is on pace to drive multiple billions of revenue for AWS this year. To get ahead of that, and other renewed cloud demand, Amazon is on pace to spend more on capital investments in the second half of the year than the $30.5 billion it doled out in the first six months of 2024. The massive cap ex spending is in line with rivals such Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta, which have all reported big increases on infrastructure investments in recent quarters.\nAmazon's investments, Olsavsky said, are being made to \"drive revenue and free cash flow for the next decade and beyond.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 17 Trending AI Stocks According to Latest News And Analyst Ratings.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nOne of the biggest breakthroughs of artificial intelligence in the past few years has been the advances in natural language processing. These AI models in language are now making their way into the business world and the society at large. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Expert economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani recently wrote in a report that the ability of AI tools to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects.\nSome of these macro factors are more discernible in the form of numbers. A recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models (read more about these firms by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To) compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\nThis exciting phase in the world of technology has ushered in a new boom for the world economy, previously plagued by inflation concerns, geopolitical conflicts, and stagnating demand figures. The bullish sentiment on AI needs to be balanced with caution. In the long run, investors should prepare themselves for significant changes to how the world works as AI could automate nearly 300 million jobs. In previous cycles of automation, new jobs and opportunities have risen to replace this. Recognizing these opportunities (read more about them by accessing 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave) ahead of the time could go a long way towards balancing the risk profiles of growth-heavy portfolios. Recent research suggests that 60% of the workforce presently was occupied in positions that did not exist just half a century ago, lending credence to claims that over 80% of employment growth since the time can be explained by tech-driven innovation.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. One of the important areas where the tech giant is implementing AI solutions is the web services business. This business, which grew 19% during the second-quarter and accounted for more than $26 billion in revenue, beat the Wall Street consensus estimates by close to 2% of around 17.6%. AI chips used to implement features on the cloud are slowly coming towards a better supply balance and the narrative around the AI prowess of the firm is also improving.\nThese developments regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are encouraging, according to analysts at investment advisory RBC Capital. The advisory has an Outperform rating on the shares with a price target of $215, and recently noted that the bull thesis on the firm was largely on track as investments in AI infrastructure to help support web services demand looked to be paying off.\nOverall AMZN ranks 3rd\u00a0on our of the trending AI stocks according to latest news and analyst ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "As Alexa turns 10, Amazon looks to generative AI",
        "Author": "  Brian Heater ",
        "Text": "Amazon loses money on Echo smart speakers. It\u2019s been an open secret for the duration of Alexa\u2019s existence. It\u2019s the product of the kind of loss leader strategy only a company of Amazon\u2019s size can get away with for a decade.\nSelling hardware at a loss can be an effective strategy, of course. Think about printers and razors, which get corporate feet into the door and make up for the loss with ink cartridges and blades, respectively.\nFrom the perspective of saturation, Amazon\u2019s strategy can be viewed as a success. Early this year, founder Jeff Bezos claimed that Alexa is now in 100 million homes, across 400 million devices.\nFinancial realities paint a wholly different picture, however. According to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, Amazon\u2019s devices division lost a staggering $25 billion in the five-year period between 2017 and 2021. The Alexa division reportedly lost $10 billion in 2022 alone.\nAt a certain point, a loss leader simply becomes a loss. That reality came crashing down at the end of 2023, when several hundred were laid off from the Alexa unit. Eleven-digit annual losses, coupled with a rough macroeconomic outlook, is an untenable situation, even for a company with $600 billion+ in annual revenue.\nAlexa isn\u2019t the only smart assistant that has fallen back down to Earth in recent years. Beyond offerings like Bixby and Cortana, which went away entirely, consumer excitement around Google Assistant and Siri has also waned.\nIn recent months, however, both Google and Apple have made it clear that they\u2019re not ready to give up the ghost. Siri took center stage at WWDC in June, as Apple breathed new life into the brand, courtesy of its new Apple Intelligence initiative. Google similarly confirmed this week that Assistant is getting a Gemini-powered boost in the home.\nA 2021 report from Bloomberg noted that, despite Alexa\u2019s popularity, a majority of queries involve one of three tasks: playing music, controlling lights and setting timers.\nA former Amazon senior employee put it even more starkly, speaking to WSJ: \u201cWe worried we\u2019ve hired 10,000 people and we\u2019ve built a smart timer.\u201d With all the published criticism leveled at Alexa in its decade-long existence, that may well be the most effortlessly cutting.\nWhile the company has continued releasing Echo devices, including an upgraded Spot announced last month, the company has taken its foot off the gas. No doubt there has been much soul searching among the Spheres. Much like Google and Apple, Amazon sees generative AI as the lifeline Alexa needs.\nThe 10,000-person timer problem is a result of devices failing to live up to customer expectations. Entreating third-party developers to create skills has been part of a larger push to make Alexa more useful. Amazon has also attempted to improve the assistant\u2019s conversational skills over the years.\nIn that respect, generative AI is a game changer. Platforms like ChatGPT have demonstrated incredible natural language conversational aptitude. Late last year, Amazon offered a preview of Alexa\u2019s generative AI-powered future.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always thought of Alexa as an evolving service, and we\u2019ve been continuously improving it since the day we introduced it in 2014,\u201d the company wrote. \u201cA longstanding mission has been to make a conversation with Alexa as natural as talking to another human, and with the rapid development of generative AI, what we imagined is now well within reach.\u201d\nNovember marks a decade since Alexa and Echo were announced. One couldn\u2019t ask for better timing to unveil a picture of what the next 10 years might look like. Whether the assistant gets another decade will depend, in part, on how the next few months play out.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/10/as-alexa-turns-10-amazon-looks-to-generative-ai/\n"

        "Text": "By Aditya Kalra and Munsif Vengattil\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com India's country head Manish Tiwary has resigned after an eight-year stint and will leave the e-commerce giant in October, the company said on Tuesday.\nHis resignation comes as Amazon is fast expanding in India where it plans to invest $26 billion by 2030, but also faces a strict regulatory environment that forces it to run only a marketplace.\nTiwary has decided to pursue an opportunity outside of the company, Amazon said, without elaborating, and will stay at the company until October to ensure a smooth transition. Tiwary did not immediately respond to a query seeking comment.\nReuters was first to report about Tiwary's departure earlier on Tuesday.\nAmazon has not immediately named a successor for the top job in India, a source familiar with the matter said.\nAmit Agarwal, senior vice president for emerging markets, will remain closely involved with the India team, Amazon said in its statement, noting \"India is an important priority\".\nThe e-commerce giant is currently facing an antitrust investigation for favouring select sellers on its India website, an allegation it denies.\nIn 2021, Reuters reported that the company ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoff goods and manipulating search results to boost its own product lines in India - practices it has denied engaging in.\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra in New Delhi and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by David Goodman and Susan Fenton)\n"

        "Author": "  Glenn Taylor ",
        "Text": "Amazon is bringing back peak season fees for third-party sellers that plan to use its mix of fulfillment services this holiday.\nThe peak fulfillment fees will apply from Oct. 15 through Jan. 14, 2025. In a post on its seller central forum, Amazon said the seasonal fee is similar to those charged by other major carriers, and covers increased fulfillment and transportation operating costs during the season.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nTexworld LA: Apparel Experts Examine Sourcing in the Second Half\nAmazon Teams with TikTok to Enable In-App Purchasing\nAmazon v. Walmart: Two Industry Behemoths Battle Over AI\nUPS unveiled its \u201cdemand surcharges\u201d for shippers in July as it seeks to make back some of the money it left on the table when customers traded down for cheaper shipping services. These surcharges will largely kick in during the peak holiday, Similarly, DHL added its own version of demand surcharges for DHL Express users as air cargo capacity constraints persist across some trade lanes.\nFedEx has not announced peak season surcharges yet.\nAmazon\u2019s fees will apply to sellers using services including: Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) in the U.S. and Canada, North America Remote Fulfillment, U.S. Multi-Channel Fulfillment and Buy with Prime.\n\u201cThe average holiday peak fulfillment fee will remain the same as last year, except for products priced under $10 in U.S. FBA, for which the peak fee is new in 2024,\u201d the company said. \u201cAmazon\u2019s average FBA fulfillment fees continue to be 70 percent less expensive than comparable two-day shipping methods offered by other major third-party logistics providers.\u201d\nFor example, a peak fee for a \u201clarge standard-size\u201d item like a T-shirt would jump to $5 to ship, versus $4.67 during the rest of the year. A \u201csmall standard-size\u201d product like a mobile device case, would jump elicit a $3.34 fee, as opposed to the non-peak $3.15 charge.\nThe company first introduced the fees during the 2022 holiday season.\nFBA fulfillment fees are calculated and charged when shipments leave the fulfillment centers. That means if a product is ordered before Oct. 15, but is shipped on or after that date, the fulfillment fees will still apply.\nAhead of the holiday, Amazon recently moved up its Black Friday shipping deadline to Oct. 19, one week earlier than last year. The online marketplace recommends sending inventory to fulfillment centers in August and September to ensure they have enough products in stock for the season.\nAmazon also quietly got rid of one of its seller fees as it gears up for the holiday. Retroactively as of July 1, the company is eliminating \u201coverage\u201d fees for FBA inventory storage in the U.S.\nThe charge penalized sellers whose inventory sitting in Amazon warehouses exceeded the limit set by the e-commerce giant.\n\u201cThe fee removal is in part due to Amazon\u2019s more effective capacity management features, and we are glad to be able to eliminate these fees and allow sellers to not worry about them as we head into peak,\u201d Amazon vice president of worldwide selling partner services Dharmesh Mehta wrote on LinkedIn. \u201cWe hope this will help more sellers ensure they have enough inventory ready for peak demand this holiday shopping season.\u201d\nAmazon offers a capacity monitor tool aimed at helping sellers stay up to date on the company\u2019s capacity limits.\nThe tech titan will still set inventory capacity limits for sellers, but they will no longer be charged the added fee if sales are slow and their in-stock inventory exceeds their threshold. Instead, Amazon will penalize the sellers by preventing them from adding to their inventory if their in-stock merchandise plus in-transit restocks surpass their limit.\nAmazon\u2019s decision softens the blow of the two new charges that it started levying FBA-using sellers in 2024, both of which drew the attention of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\nAn inbound placement fee, which went into effect March 1, required sellers to pay and use the Amazon Warehousing and Distribution (AWD) bulk storage service unless they opt to ship goods to at least four different warehouses using their own resources.\nThe second fee, a low-inventory-level fee, slapped sellers who carry \u201cconsistently low\u201d levels of inventory relative to unit sales. That fee first went into effect April 1, but the imposition was postponed after negative feedback, with Amazon instead crediting the sellers through May 31 to help them transition into the fees.\nThe overage fees were called out by some sellers when the low-inventory-level fees were announced, with some arguing that it was unfair to have to find a \u201csweet spot\u201d for inventory given that sales can vary month to month based on a factors like seasonality and product fads.\n"

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. Beat Analyst Estimates: See What The Consensus Is Forecasting For This Year",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Last week, you might have seen that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) released its second-quarter result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 8.4% to US$168 in the past week. It looks like a credible result overall - although revenues of US$148b were what the analysts expected, Amazon.com surprised by delivering a (statutory) profit of US$1.26 per share, an impressive 23% above what was forecast. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year.\n Check out our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nTaking into account the latest results, the consensus forecast from Amazon.com's 57 analysts is for revenues of US$635.6b in 2024. This reflects a credible 5.2% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to swell 11% to US$4.69. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$638.9b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.58 in 2024. So the consensus seems to have become somewhat more optimistic on Amazon.com's earnings potential following these results.\nThere's been no major changes to the consensus price target of US$221, suggesting that the improved earnings per share outlook is not enough to have a long-term positive impact on the stock's valuation. There's another way to think about price targets though, and that's to look at the range of price targets put forward by analysts, because a wide range of estimates could suggest a diverse view on possible outcomes for the business. Currently, the most bullish analyst values Amazon.com at US$251 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$180. This shows there is still a bit of diversity in estimates, but analysts don't appear to be totally split on the stock as though it might be a success or failure situation.\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Amazon.com's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 11% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 16% over the past five years. Compare this to the 33 other companies in this industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenue at 10% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it looks like Amazon.com is forecast to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.\nThe biggest takeaway for us is the consensus earnings per share upgrade, which suggests a clear improvement in sentiment around Amazon.com's earnings potential next year. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$221, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\nKeeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider.

        "Title": "Teamsters say NLRB decision undercuts Amazon delivery ownership model, could boost unionization",
        "Author": "  John Kingston ",
        "Text": "The Teamsters are cheering a decision by a regional office of the National Labor Relations Board that Amazon is a joint employer at a delivery service partner (DSP) in California that recognized a Teamsters local\u2019s representation of the DSP\u2019s drivers.\nWhile the decision has not yet been published by the NLRB, the Teamsters said its delivery drivers who are represented by Local 396 in Palmdale, California, had won a victory at the NLRB\u2019s Region 31 board, which operates in Los Angeles.\n\u201cAfter more than a year-long investigation, [the regional board] found that Amazon is a joint employer of its Delivery Service Partner (DSP) drivers and therefore has a legal duty to recognize and bargain with the Teamsters union,\u201d the union said in a prepared statement.\n\nA spokeswoman for the union said it had been informed by NLRB personnel about the decision.\nThe workers were employed by a DSP called Battle Tested Strategies (BTS). They voted last year to be represented by the Teamsters through a card check process, and the company recognized the union. Amazon soon after yanked the DSP contract with BTS.\nAmazon has long held that drivers delivering goods ordered from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) do not work for the logistics and retailing giant. Rather, they are employees of their DSPs, who have been granted the right by Amazon to serve a defined area.\nBut the decision by the regional board of the NLRB rejects that finding.\n\nAnd in an acknowledgement of the stakes that the decision raises, the union said in its statement that it is \u201cconfident the NLRB\u2019s regional determination for the Palmdale workers will extend to Amazon DSP drivers who unionize nationwide.\u201d\nThe NLRB regional board authorized the issuance of a complaint against Amazon. That complaint will be heard at a trial before an NLRB administrative law judge in Los Angeles, according to Julie Gutman Dickinson, a partner at the law firm of Bush Gottlieb in Los Angeles and a longtime outside counsel for the Teamsters.\nDickson said whatever decision comes out of that trial could be appealed to the full NLRB in Washington. She said there was no firm estimate on when the trial might be scheduled.\n\u201cThere are huge, huge legal implications, because we believe the model in Palmdale is the same as DSPs throughout the country,\u201d Gutman Dickinson said. The regional decision \u201csets the stage\u201d for a legal process that could determine that Amazon is a joint employer with the DSPs, \u201cand will have a duty to recognize and bargain with any union that represents the majority of those employees.\u201d\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from FreightWaves.\nHowever, in comments to the Los Angeles Times, an Amazon spokeswoman said the NLRB had dismissed \u201cmost of the Teamsters\u2019 more significant claims.\u201d\n\u201cAs they have been for over 15 months, the Teamsters continue to misrepresent what is happening here,\u201d Eileen Hards told the newspaper. \u201cAs we have said all along, there is no merit to the Teamsters\u2019 claims. If and when the agency decides it wants to litigate the remaining allegations, we expect they will be dismissed as well.\u201d\nBut the Teamsters painted a different picture of the as-yet-unpublished decision.\n\n\u201cThe NLRB Region in Los Angeles also found that Amazon engaged in a long list of egregious unfair labor practices at its Palmdale facility, including unlawfully refusing to recognize the workers\u2019 decision to unionize with the Teamsters; failing and refusing to bargain with the Teamsters over conditions of employment and the effects of its decision to terminate its DSP\u2019s contract; threatening employees with job loss; holding unlawful captive audience meetings; intimidating employees with security guards; and other illegal retaliation against the group of newly unionized workers,\u201d the union said in its statement.\nThe reality on the ground for the roughly 85 BST workers at Palmdale who voted to unionize is that they have been on strike since April 2023 against an employer who had its DSP status revoked.\nThe Teamsters also are fighting a case before the NLRB with parallels to the Battle Tested case.\nA DSP in Skokie, Illinois, Four Star Express Delivery, saw its roughly 100 drivers vote earlier this year to be represented by Teamsters Local 705. They struck in late June. The end result was a layoff notice and the termination by Amazon of the Four Star contract to be a DSP.\nMore articles by John Kingston\nVirginia carrier\u2019s win against union may ultimately give labor a boost at NLRB\nTeamsters voted in to represent drivers at Kroger fulfillment center, say it\u2019s a first\nTeamsters tie up with Staten Island Amazon union, win other elections\nThe post Teamsters say NLRB decision undercuts Amazon delivery ownership model, could boost unionization appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In the 30 years since Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was founded, it's become one of the world's most renowned companies. It's one of the top three most recognized companies, according to financial services company IG Group, and was recently named one of the world's most admired companies -- for the eighth consecutive year -- by Fortune magazine.\nThe company rose to prominence as an online retailer with its instantly recognizable \"smiley face\" boxes but has expanded its empire into cloud computing, personal electronics, streaming video and music, and most recently, artificial intelligence (AI).\nInvestors are most excited about the potential offered by AI, and cloud computing has long been Amazon's most important breadwinner. However, investors might be surprised to learn that another area of the company's business is generating the fastest growth.\nThe aforementioned diversity of Amazon's business gives the company plenty of avenues for growth. For example, Amazon's e-commerce business grew by 7% during the preceding 12 months. The past couple of years have weighed on the online retail segment as inflation cut into consumer spending and shoppers traded down to lower-cost items.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud infrastructure service, also suffered from a dearth of spending in recent years. The cloud segment grew 15% over the past year, as businesses have also been reticent to spend unnecessarily.\nHowever, the unsung hero in Amazon's business over the past year has been its digital advertising segment, which grew 24% over the past year, far outpacing the growth of Amazon's other major business segments. The segment generated $51 billion in revenue during the preceding four quarters but still has plenty of growth ahead.\nAmazon's e-commerce website is the foundation of the company's online advertising opportunity, the result of its extremely valuable digital \"real estate.\" The company has a horde of data regarding the buying habits of its online customers.\nA \"sponsored\" listing on Amazon's site is more likely to be seen by shoppers, and the company's algorithms ensure that the product placements appear to highly motivated customers or those most likely to make a purchase. While this is the cornerstone of Amazon's advertising business, the company has many more opportunities from which to thrive.\nEarly this year, movies and television shows on Amazon Prime video began showing advertising automatically to all viewers. Users are given the option to opt out of advertising for an additional fee of $2.99 per month. The move could generate an additional $5.2 billion in ad revenue this year, according to estimates provided by The Wall Street Journal.\nFurthermore, live sports on Amazon, including NFL Football, include advertising by default, giving the company another way to increase its ad revenue. There are also advertising opportunities on Twitch (its video game streaming platform), the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) (its movie and television information catalog), and a number of Amazon's electronic devices.\nGiven the breadth of Amazon's properties, it's easy to see how the company continues to grow its advertising at a brisk pace.\nThe advent of generative AI will also play into Amazon's digital advertising ambitions. The company has released a host of tools to assist advertisers on its platform. For example, Amazon offers an AI-powered image generator to help marketers create more relevant ads and a tool to help write more effective product descriptions.\nAmazon has already become a powerhouse in the space and is now the world's third-largest digital advertiser, behind just Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. Yet given the significant opportunity, the stock is surprisingly affordable. At just 3x sales, Amazon represents a compelling opportunity for investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Yes, I'd Buy Amazon Stock on This Post-Earnings Dip. Here's Why",
        "Author": "  James Brumley, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's no denying it -- Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) just disappointed a whole bunch of shareholders. Not only did the e-commerce giant's second-quarter sales fall short of estimates, but its third-quarter revenue guidance is also shy of analysts' expectations. The stock's well down in response to the report, reaching a new multiweek low as a result of the tumble.\nThis sell-off, however, is ultimately a buying opportunity. Investors are so consumed by these two red flags that they're not seeing the bigger, bullish picture.\nHere's the deal.\nOn the off chance you're reading this and aren't already aware, for the three months ending in June, Amazon turned $148 billion worth of revenue into a per-share profit of $1.26. Those numbers are up from year-ago numbers of $134.4 billion and $0.65 per share (respectively), while earnings topped the expected $1.03. But even strong sales growth from the company's cloud computing and North American e-commerce arms weren't enough to push the top line to the projected $148.7 billion.\nAggravating the revenue miss is the company's lackluster guidance for the quarter now underway. Amazon says it's only looking for Q3 sales of between $154 billion and $158.5 billion. While that's 8% to 11% above last year's third-quarter comparison, the figure still doesn't compare favorably to analysts' consensus of $158.2 billion.\nInvestors flinched.\nBut this sudden wave of worry looks right past three bullish realities the market's likely to remember sooner than later. Here they are, in no particular order.\nYes, last quarter's top line was disappointing, as was the outlook for the third quarter. Keep it in perspective, though. Amazon's second-quarter sales were still up 10% year over year, roughly in line with the revenue growth of between 8% and 11% anticipated for the quarter now underway. Outside of the artificial intelligence and weight-loss drug industries, you'd be hard-pressed to find a company still driving as much growth as this one.\nAnd that's not an assumption. A forecast from FactSet suggests the S&P 500's third-quarter sales will likely only improve to the tune of 5% year over year.\nConnect the dots. Even if it's not completely immune to any and all challenges, Amazon is still a superior growth company, and still a better growth investment than most other stocks.\nAmazon's anticipated sales growth is apt to be very profitable, too. At the midpoint of the third quarter's operating income guidance of between $11.5 billion and $15 billion, the company is set to drive an 18% year-over-year improvement on Q3-2023's operating income of $11.2 billion. For comparison, FactSet says the S&P 500 is likely to see earnings growth of only 6.8% for the same period.\nHow is this company achieving what most others can't? Amazon's big growth drivers are also its highest-margin profit centers. Amazon Web Services saw sales growth of nearly 19% for the three months ending in June, with 35% of that figure ($9.3 billion) being turned into operating income.\nMeanwhile, although the company doesn't disclose profit margin data for its nascent advertising operation, this is a business that monetizes the online shopping platform Amazon operates anyway. Of the $12.8 billion worth of ad sales reported for last quarter -- up 20% year over year -- a sizable chunk of it was likely converted into operating profit as well.\nFinally, while the knee-jerk bearish response to Amazon's second-quarter report and third-quarter guidance makes superficial sense, it may be less about the company and more about investors' current perceptions of the stock market's foreseeable future.\nThink about it. Headlines have turned considerably more pessimistic in just the past few days, dragging the S&P 500 down from its mid-July peak on worries of a weakening economy. Even before Friday's poor jobs report for July, bond ratings agency Fitch expressed fresh concerns that loan defaults and delinquencies were set to rise in the latter half of the year. Since then, the International Monetary Fund has dialed back its full-year GDP growth forecast for the United States from 2.7% to 2.6% in front of expected 2025 growth of only 1.9%.\nThese are all legitimate concerns for investors, to be sure. But they can also leave stocks unfairly vulnerable to even just the mildest of bad news -- like Amazon's revenue letdown.\nThe good news is that such heightened bearish sentiment passes quickly enough. Once this wave of it is in the rearview mirror, don't be surprised to see Amazon stock perk up as investors recognize it's still a powerhouse.\nIs Amazon stock at its exact ultimate low right now? Maybe, maybe not. Nobody really knows.\nWhat we do know is that Amazon's stock is currently down 20% from its early-July high, offering a healthy discount on shares of what is otherwise still a leading company, one with high-margin growth drivers like cloud computing and advertising, both of which should continue performing well even if the economy slows from here.\nIf you're a long-term investor waiting on a good entry point for a new position in this stock, don't overthink this dip. The rhetoric is far worse than Amazon's reality.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best 5G Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other 5G stocks.\n5G, or fifth-generation wireless technology, is the latest evolution in mobile networks, which is designed to significantly improve speed, reduce latency, and enhance the capacity and connectivity of mobile devices. A Market Research Future report estimates that in 2024, the 5G market is projected to be worth $15.03 billion, and by 2032, it could reach $229.41 billion. This rapid increase represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.60% during the forecast period. According to some experts, 5G is one of the most important trends in technology along with artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn a CNBC interview at the Mobile World Congress Shanghai on June 26, director-general of the GSM Association, Mats Granryd highlighted the deep connection between 5G and AI and suggested that their mutual rise is not accidental. He said that \u201cAI feeds off 5G and 5G feeds off AI.\u201d\u00a0 This is especially evident in China, where the development of standalone 5G networks is well advanced and discussions are already shifting toward 5G Advanced (5.5G). While some countries lag, like the Philippines, Mats pointed out that this dynamic between 5G and AI is most prominent in regions with widespread 5G coverage.\nWhen asked about the rivalry between countries like the U.S. and China in AI and 5G, Mats said that such competition is insignificant. He said that from his experience on the GSMA board, which represents the 25 largest mobile operators globally, the focus is on creating common standards and specifications rather than competing.\nHe talked about the difficulties of the 2G and 3G eras when different technologies created challenges for global connectivity. The shift to a unified 4G standard was a pivotal moment that laid the foundation for the digital economy.\nMats believes that 5G will follow a similar path to become a common platform worldwide, which will also extend to AI. While some regions may advance faster than others initially, he showed confidence in the fact that everyone will eventually catch up and benefit from the integration of AI with 5G.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used stock screeners and ETFs to identify companies involved in the 5G market. We then selected 10 stocks with the smallest short interest and listed them in descending order of their short interest. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 elite hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nShort Interest as % of Shares Outstanding: 0.68%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 308\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company known for its various offerings in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and AI. While it is widely recognized for its e-commerce platform and Prime membership, it has also made advancements in the 5G technology sector through its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is one of the best 5G stocks to buy according to short sellers.\nAWS provides a variety of solutions tailored for the development and management of 5G networks, including AWS Private 5G, Edge Computing for 5G, and AWS 5G Core Network Solutions. AWS Private 5G is a managed service designed to assist businesses in setting up, managing, and expanding their own private 5G networks on their premises.\nIn addition, AWS partners with telecom operators such as Verizon to aid in their 5G deployments. AWS also offers edge computing solutions, including AWS Outposts, which enable telecom providers to deliver computational power directly to businesses.\nIn the second quarter, 308 hedge funds had stakes in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), with total positions worth $65.8 billion. As of June 30,\u00a0Fisher Asset Management\u00a0is the most significant shareholder in the company with a stake worth $8.46 billion.\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing need for cloud computing and data infrastructure, which are crucial for the expansion of 5G networks. As the adoption of 5G technology progresses, there is a rising demand for innovative cloud services and enhanced data processing capabilities, making AWS a key player in this space.\nAccording to a media brand, CRN, AWS has a dominant position in the global cloud market, where it had a 31% share in the first quarter. This leadership is supported by the company\u2019s extensive investment in product development, including custom AI chips and advanced software, which supports its growing role in AI cloud services.\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) saw its total sales rise by 10% to $148 billion in the second quarter, with projections for the third quarter indicating a growth rate of 8% to 11%. AWS contributed $9.3 billion in operating income for the quarter, accounting for 63% of the company\u2019s total operating income. CEO Andy Jassy highlighted that over the past 18 months, AWS has introduced more machine learning and generative AI features than all other major cloud providers combined. Furthermore, the company plans to invest nearly $150 billion in data centers over the next 15 years as it anticipates a surge in demand for AI cloud services.\nDiamond Hill Capital\u00a0stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 2nd in our list of the best 5G stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks That Have Jim Cramer\u2019s Attention. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks that have Jim Cramer's attention.\nOn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer notes that after a significant rally in the past two weeks, the market took a hit ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming meeting in Jackson Hole. The Dow fell 170 points, the S&P dropped 43 points, and the NASDAQ tumbled 1.67%. This downturn marks a return to reality, which can be harsh.\n\u201cAfter the monster move we\u2019ve had in the last two weeks, that\u2019s why, on the eve of the big Federal Reserve powwow in Jackson Hole, the averages got slammed. It\u2019s back to reality, and reality can sting.\u201d\nPreviously, after a dramatic unwind of the Yen carry trade, the market quickly collapsed but then rebounded strongly over eight days. According to Cramer, during that period, anything that was doing well surged, and there was optimism that anything struggling would improve once the Fed started cutting rates. However, that optimism has faded.\n\u201cIf you remember, after the sudden unwind of the Yen carry trade, the market experienced a sharp decline followed by a remarkable 8-day rebound. During that time, stocks that were performing well surged, and there was hope that struggling stocks would improve once the Fed began cutting rates. However, that was then, and this is now.\u201d\nNow, we\u2019re experiencing what Cramer refers to as the \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d phase. Stocks that had risen on hope alone are now falling sharply. Even the prospect of the Fed stepping in hasn\u2019t been enough to prevent the decline.\n\u201cSince the winning streak ended, we\u2019re entering what I call the \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse\u201d phase. Stocks that had been climbing based on hope alone are now falling hard. Even the prospect of Fed intervention isn\u2019t enough to prevent this decline. The selling might be exaggerated because the Fed is set to speak in Jackson Hole, and Wall Street has already factored in the possibility of a September rate cut\u2014beyond that, it\u2019s unlikely the Fed will announce multiple rate cuts, as some bulls hope.\u201d\nCramer dismisses the first two explanations for the current market weakness: the idea that the Fed\u2019s actions are too late or that the Fed can\u2019t fix the economy. He believes the Fed\u2019s interventions still have a significant impact, although companies with poor balance sheets might struggle.\n\u201cThere are also concerns that the Fed might be too late to make a difference, or that traders fear a potential Democratic sweep in November could lead to higher corporate tax rates\u2014bad for earnings\u2014and increased scrutiny on price gouging in supermarkets and drugstores.\nThe third explanation, political concerns, seems more plausible to Cramer. He points out that investors initially saw President Biden as less favorable to the stock market due to his pro-labor stance. However, recent discussions suggest that a potential Harris presidency might be even more challenging for businesses. Harris is seen as critical of companies raising prices and could push for measures against price gouging, which might be difficult to achieve.\n\u201cThe third, politics-is-trickier. Before this week, many investors saw President Biden as unfavorable to the stock market due to his pro-labor stance. However, Vice President Harris, coming from California with ties to the tech industry and connections like her brother-in-law Tony West, General Counsel at Uber, was thought to be more business-friendly.\nCramer is also concerned about a recent prediction from market expert Larry Williams, which adds to his apprehension about the market\u2019s future.\n\u201cOn the campaign trail, Harris might not recognize the distinction between good and bad actors, opting instead to broadly criticize big businesses for taking advantage of the pandemic. These factors might explain some of today\u2019s market weakness, but what concerns me most is a recent prediction from market expert Larry Williams. I respect Larry\u2019s insights and prefer not to contradict him.\nJim Cramer said Larry Williams predicted that the rally was \u201ckaput.\u201d This term, implying that the rally might be over, is especially worrying considering it was used after the eighth day of gains. Despite this winning streak, the market didn\u2019t surpass its previous highs. Larry\u2019s charts also indicated that the S&P 500 might face difficulties in the coming week, particularly due to Nvidia, which he considers a crucial stock in the market.\n\u201cLarry sent us his thoughts on Monday, and he used a term that made me concerned. He said that the rally was \u201ckaput.\u201d Mind you, this was on the eighth day. The word \u201ckaput\u201d has some ominous connotations, right? Especially because we didn\u2019t take out the highs of the averages despite the 8-day win streak. Worse, Larry\u2019s charts showed tough sledding for the S&P 500 next week, led by the most important stock in the entire market\u2014maybe the most important stock I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\nJim Cramer notes that with the market currently overbought\u2014reflected in the S&P short-range oscillator reading of plus five\u2014Larry\u2019s view that the rally could be over seems plausible. Wall Street\u2019s favorite GPU maker experienced a sharp drop recently, despite its strong performance leading up to the quarter. The stock\u2019s sudden reversal was difficult to watch.\n\u201cGiven that the market\u2019s overbought\u2014plus five on the S&P short-range oscillator that I follow\u2014the idea that the rally is kaput has some resonance. It doesn\u2019t help that Nvidia ran up rapidly into the quarter and expectations have gotten out of hand. The stock did a horrible reversal today\u2014just painful to watch.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we analyze a recent episode of Jim Cramer\u2019s Mad Money, where he highlighted ten stocks. We also review hedge fund opinions on these stocks and rank them based on hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 308\nIn a recent Mad Money episode, Jim Cramer explained that after Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s recent earnings report, which faced criticism due to weaker consumer sales and concerns about potential declines, the stock dropped to around $160. However, Cramer noted that Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has since rebounded, suggesting that the initial negative forecasts were too pessimistic.\n\u201cWhen Amazon reported three weeks ago, the quarter was criticized, with sellers focusing on weaker consumer sales and management\u2019s comments on potential declines. Critics viewed concerns over spending impacts from the news cycle as an excuse. Despite this, the stock, which fell to around $160, has rebounded, reflecting that the negative forecasts were premature.\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) achieved a 15% increase in revenue and a 33% rise in net income, reflecting successful business strategies and operational improvements. AWS plays a key role in Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s growth, with its revenue increase underscoring its leading position in cloud computing and potential for further expansion.\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s advancements in e-commerce and logistics, such as automation and new delivery solutions, help it capture more of the online retail market and enhance customer experience. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u2019s focus on sustainability and climate goals also boosts its reputation and operational efficiency.\nOverall AMZN ranks 10th on our list of the stocks that have Jim Cramer's attention. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs' Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks: Top 20 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) against Goldman Sachs' other hedge fund stock picks.\nThe close of August has marked a highly awaited paradigm shift on Wall Street that investors have been wishing for months. This shift comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally admitted that the time for interest rate cuts had come. Investors rejoiced and the flagship S&P index gained 1.15% while the Dow's blue chip stock index added 1.14% to its value.\nBefore the Fed chair's remarks, investment bank Goldman Sachs had already taken a detailed look at the implications of interest rate cuts on the stock market. In a podcast, the bank's trading strategy head Josh Schiffrin started by explaining that the prospect of the Fed reducing rates was linked \"very closely to the performance of short-term bonds.\" He however added that it's \"really been bonds that have been responsive, where the story has been quite clear,\" pointing out that \"the stock market has been range bound and choppy with a fair amount of rotation between different sectors\" which leads to index level moves being \"muted.\" This makes sense when we consider the Dow and S&P's movements following Powell's latest comments, as the one percentage point gain for each indicated that investors were well prepared for rate cuts even before the Fed Chair took the stand.\nSpeaking of the flagship S&P index, GS' head of American Equity Sales Trading John Flood shared some insights at the June close. Starting off by highlighting the drives of the index's performance during the first half of the year, Flood outlined that when it came to hedge funds, artificial intelligence and GLP-1 were the two key trends that had driven index returns. He described it as \"a long momentum trade\" with \"both cohorts\" of the hedge fund side, namely the \"systemic and fundamental long-short\" fully involved in trading.\nThe Goldman equity head also added that retail investors were finally back as well, and they were focused on \"focused on the ten biggest stocks in the world.\" You can see which companies these might be by reading 20 Largest Companies in the World by Market Cap in 2024. One key concern among investors and analysts alike this year has been a bifurcation in market returns that has seen only the best performers yield most of the rewards. This was also on the mind of analysts from another well known Wall Street bank, who added that it created an opportunity for further profits. Flood shared that while five stocks accounted for \"60% of S&P 500's return year to date,\" this sharp divide did not make him uncomfortable.\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\nThe investor flood of optimism surrounding AI, which has pushed the shares of the top AI GPU designer in the world to post an unbelievable 321,150% in all time returns, has also led to worries that the market might be witnessing another period akin to the ill fated dotcom era of the 1990s. When asked whether this period reminded him of that time, Flood replied that his firm felt \"a little bit more like 1995 than 1999. And 1995 clearly was a very positive year for the stock market and a positive run,\" particularly since \"valuations and earnings from market leaders are way friendlier today than they were in 1999.\" Concluding by sharing that he felt \"very bullish\" the analyst also forecast his estimate for the flagship S&P. His estimate? Well, Flood believes that \"you could see S&P 500 trade well north of 6,000 this year as the biggest get bigger and we continue to just see a little bit of a news vacuum into the elections right now.\"\nThe bit about market bifurcation between big and small companies was also on the mind of GS' senior US portfolio strategist Ben Snider. He commented on the jump in small cap stocks in July when they gained as much as 2% while other indexes lost up to 1.98% due to investors positioning themselves for potential interest rate cuts. Snider explained that small cap stocks tend to take on more debt, and lower rates coupled with their lower market values lead to big gains. According to him \"if just 1% of assets comes out of the S&P 500 and flows into, for example, the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index, that 1% of S&P 500 market cap would represent more than 15% of Russell 2000 market cap.\" Coming back to AI, the Goldman strategist has a tip for those who might be worried that the hype surrounding AI might be more than the technology's ability to generate money for the firms that plan to plow a trillion dollars into it. He shared that as opposed to the market cap weighted benchmark S&P, it might be prudent to invest in the equal weight variant \"if you are concerned about the degree of concentration or AI investment.\"\nSpeaking of AI, GS was also out with a detailed report in July which analyzed the year to date returns of different AI sectors. The AI stack, broadly speaking, is made up of four categories of firms. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid and moving upwards, these are chip manufacturers and designers, those that provide AI capacity like server farms, firms that sell AI products, and finally, companies that will see the largest gains from the ubiquitous or near ubiquitous adaptation of AI. As per GS, the year to date returns of these four sectors as of late July were 139% (represented only by the top AI GPU stock), 22%, -2%, and 2% respectively. One of the strongest performers within the AI infrastructure segment is utilities, and there's further room ahead as analyst Ryan Hammond believes that \"after adjusting valuations for the improvement in long- term EPS growth expectations that the sector has experienced, Utilities\u2019 PEG (P/E to long term growth (LTG)) ratio is 2x, well below the historical average of 3x.\"\nSo, with GS taking a broad view of the market, we decided to see which hedge fund stocks the bank is a fan of.\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs' top hedge fund stocks, we ranked the bank's list of stocks with the number of hedge funds that, according to its data, had the stock as a top ten holding.\nWe also mentioned the total number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks as per Insider Monkey's data. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world's biggest eCommerce retailer. Along with its eCommerce platform, the firm is a key player in the lucrative enterprise computing market through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business division. These two are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s biggest businesses, and its sizeable resources have enabled the firm to become another key player in the AI race through its work with Anthropic. Anthropic allows Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with access to a foundational AI model called Claude. Like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Meta's Llama, and Google's Gemini, Claude allows Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and its customers to build AI powered experiences for a multitude of use cases such as chat bots. The firm's eCommerce business also makes it a key player in the advertising industry, especially since it attracted 3.25 billion users in June. Data shows that a growing number of advertisers are now focused on customized advertising through sites such as Amazon, and AI enables Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) to improve its advertising product portfolio for merchants and publishers. However, legal headwinds in the form of predatory merchant practices or anti trust action could create troubles for the firm.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cAmazon.com Inc. (AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 19, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Walmart WMT, Amazon AMZN and Target TGT.\nThe combination of Walmart\u2019s beat-and-raise quarterly release and the positive July Retail Sales report has forced the gloom-and-doom narrative that threatened to take center stage just a few days ago into retreat.\nThe clouds have not fully lifted yet, though, and downside risks still remain. But for now, at least, the soft-landing narrative is back in the ascendant, which has done wonders for market sentiment. Also helping market sentiment is further evidence from the July CPI reading that reassured investors on the inflation question.\nEven before the July CPI report, many in the market had already realized that the Fed\u2019s priority had shifted from price stability to full employment. A rate cut at the central bank\u2019s September meeting is now a given, with the magnitude of the cut as the only point of uncertainty. A bigger-than-normal cut will be seen as a sign of concern from the Fed about the growth outlook.\nSome in the market discount the significance of the robust Walmart earnings report as a helpful read-through on consumer spending trends and the state of household finances. Walmart\u2019s strong results for the May through July period and upgraded guidance for the current and coming periods provides further evidence of the economy\u2019s resilience in the face of many challenges.\nWalmart is no longer simply a big box retailer as it has a growing digital footprint that has proved to be a worthy competitor to Amazon. The company has been gaining market share for a while now by attracting higher-income households to its convenient delivery and pick-up services.\nWalmart has captured a bigger market share due to its digital investments, which has also made its website a desirable advertising destination. Such advertising revenues are higher margin for Walmart, just as they are for Amazon. Management talked about use cases of artificial intelligence in the digital business, further evidence that this is no longer the old Walmart.\nTarget, which reports quarterly results on Wednesday, August 21st, has some reassuring read-throughs from the Walmart report, particularly management\u2019s commentary about stability and favorable trends in non-essential merchandise.\nA big difference between Walmart and Target is the weightage of groceries and other essentials in the business mix, which accounts for about two-thirds of Walmart\u2019s revenues. Target is more weighted towards non-essentials, with groceries accounting for about a third of the total. Households have been spending less on such discretionary categories as furniture, apparel, and others in the post-Covid world, which has been problematic for Target and others.\nWalmart noted improvements in some of the non-grocery merchandise on its earnings call, which will likely be confirmed in the Target report as well.\nWith respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q2 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 26 of the 36 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Please note that these 26 retailers account for 89.2% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index.\nRegular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor\u2019s standard industry classification.\nThe Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazonand restaurant players. The 26 Zacks retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q2 results already belong to the e-commerce, restaurant industries, and some of the conventional retailers, such as Walmart, which have reported already.\nTotal Q2 earnings for these 26 retailers that have reported are up +19.3% from the same period last year on +5.3% higher revenues, with 57.7% beating EPS estimates and only 42.3% beating revenue estimates.\nThe Retail sector companies have struggled with beating EPS and revenue estimates in Q2. In fact, Q2 EPS and revenue beats percentages for these players represent a new low over the preceding 20 quarters (5 years).\nWith respect to the elevated earnings rate at this stage, we like to show the group\u2019s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 26 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon\u2019s Q2 earnings were up +99.8% on +10.1% higher revenues, as it beat on EPS but missed top-line expectations.\nAs we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart a growing online vendor. As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart\u2019s results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.\nAs noted earlier, we have started seeing signs of stress at the lower end of income distribution, and one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. Inflation may be down from the multi-decade highs of a few quarters back, but it still remains a headwind, particularly for the lower end of income distribution. That said, the labor market remains very strong, with wages still going up.\nWe will hear more about this and other headwinds on the Q2 earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods.\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, August 16th, we have seen Q2 results from 464 S&P 500 members, or 92.8% of the index\u2019s membership. Total earnings for these index members are up +8.3% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 79.3% beating EPS estimates and only 59.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\nPlenty of Q2 results are still to come, even though we have already seen results from more than 92% of S&P 500 members. This week brings in results from over 100 companies, including 14 S&P 500 members. The notable companies on deck to report results this week include, besides the aforementioned, Target, Lowe\u2019s, Macy\u2019s, TJX Companies, Urban Outfitters, and others.\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low level of Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, the Q2 revenue beats percentage of 59.5% is a new low for this group of index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\nRevenue beats have been low from the start of the reporting cycle, a trend that will carry through to the end of the earnings season.\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9.5% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues.\nThis is the highest earnings growth pace in the last eight quarters since the +10% growth rate in 2022 Q1. The Q2 aggregate earnings total is on track to be a new all-time quarterly record.\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.2% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues.\nPlease note that estimates for Q3 have been steadily coming down, with the current +4.2% earnings growth rate down from +6.9% in early July.\nThis is a bigger cut to estimates relative to what we saw in the comparable periods for the preceding two quarters. The negative revisions trend is broad-based, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut since the quarter began. The most significant cuts have been to the Transportation, Business Services, Energy, Aerospace, and Basic Materials sectors. On the positive side, estimates for the Tech sector are increasing, while those for the Finance sector are only marginally higher relative to where we started in early July.\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.1% on +1.7% revenue growth. Excluding the Energy sector drag, whose earnings are now expected to be down -10.8% in 2024, total earnings for the rest of the index would be up +9.6%.\nThe expected 2024 revenue growth pace improves to +4.1% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +7.7% on an ex-Finance basis.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Estimates Face Pressure: What to Know? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Britain's competition watchdog said on Thursday it had started an investigation into whether Amazon's partnership with AI startup Anthropic raised competition, days after it began a similar probe on Alphabet's collaboration with the startup.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it now had until Oct. 4 for its so-called Phase 1 decision to either refer the artificial intelligence (AI)-focussed partnership for a deeper probe or clear it of competition concerns.\n\"Amazon's collaboration with Anthropic does not raise any competition concerns or meet the CMA's own threshold for review,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\"Amazon holds no board seat nor decision-making power at Anthropic, and Anthropic is free to work with any other provider (and indeed has multiple partners),\" the spokesperson said, echoing comments from an Anthropic spokesperson.\n\"Our strategic partnerships and investor relationships do not diminish our corporate governance independence or our freedom to partner with others,\" the Anthropic spokesperson said.\n\"We intend to cooperate with the CMA and provide them with a comprehensive understanding of Amazon's investment and our commercial collaboration.\"\nLate in July, CMA launched a probe into Google parent Alphabet's partnership with Anthropic, which was co-founded by former OpenAI executives and siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei.\nAntitrust regulators around the world have been increasingly concerned by multiple deals struck between smaller industry startups and big tech giants.\nRegulators in the United States, European Union and Britain signed a joint statement in July promising to work together to safeguard fair competition in the industry.\n(Reporting by Prerna Bedi and Yamini Kalia in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza)\n"

        "Text": "If you\u2019re a retiree, beware. While Labor Day is a great time to score mega savings, it\u2019s also when scammers hope to take advantage of unsuspecting seniors.\n\u201cUnfortunately, scammers may take advantage of the hype by offering fraudulent Labor Day discounts or making advertisements for products that don\u2019t exist,\u201d the Better Business Bureau warned.\nFind Out: 2 Things Empty Nesters Should Stop Investing In To Boost Retirement Savings\nBe Aware: 7 Reasons You Shouldn\u2019t Retire Before Speaking To a Financial Advisor\nData compromises, including from cyberattacks, are on the rise, increasing by a staggering 72% since 2021. Last year alone, over 343 million people had their data compromised in cyberattacks, according to The Identity Theft Research Center Annual Data Breach Report.\nSeniors are often the targets of cyber crimes. In fact, cyber criminals bilked people over age 60 out of $3.4 billion last year \u2014 an increase of nearly 11% from 2022 \u2014 per the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center.\nAs Labor Day sales get underway, hackers will be lurking, hoping to steal personal information and your money.\nHere are scams retirees should be aware of.\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\nPassword stealing is increasing among some of the biggest recognized brands, including Amazon.\u00a0A new analysis by researchers at Kaspersky found that Amazon is the third leading site for most hack attempts, Forbes reported. But you can help prevent attacks by\u00a0using strong passwords and a virtual private network.\n\u201cPublic Wi-Fi networks are often not secure, making it easy for cybercriminals to intercept your data,\u201d Abhishek Karnik, McAfee\u2019s head of threat research, told GOBankingRates. \u201cUsing a VPN encrypts your internet connection and data, providing a secure way to access the internet even on public networks.\u201d\nLearn More: I\u2019m a Retired Boomer \u2014 Here Are 3 Debts You Should Definitely Pay Off Before Retiremen\nIt isn\u2019t your lucky day if you\u2019ve unexpectedly received multiple boxes from Amazon that you didn\u2019t order. You might be a victim of brushing. It\u2019s becoming so prevalent that the Better Business Bureau recently issued a statement about how to protect yourself from this latest Amazon scam.\nWhy do the perpetrators engage in brushing? The BBB explained, \u201cThey intend to make it appear that you wrote a glowing online review of their merchandise and that you are a verified buyer of that merchandise. They then post a fake, positive review to improve their product\u2019s ratings, which means more sales. The payoff is highly profitable from their perspective.\u201d\nMaybe that doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, but it means someone has your personal information, including your home address. Plus, the threat of porch pirates is real. The people behind the brushing could have others watching your house to get to the packages before you see them.\nHere\u2019s what to do if you feel you\u2019re a victim, per the BBB:\nNotify Amazon customer service. Brushing and fake reviews are against their policy.\nChange the passwords for all of your accounts. Brushing could indicate the hackers have your information.\nKeep the merchandise. You have the legal right to do so.\nCheck your recent order history. If you find items you didn\u2019t purchase, you can refuse the package if you\u2019re home when it\u2019s delivered.\nTry to identify the sender and look for fake reviews under your name. You can ask Amazon to take them down.\nImpersonation scams are rising and have reached a new level of complexity, resulting in $1.1 billion in losses last year, according to the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cA fake Amazon employee might transfer you to a fake bank or even a fake FBI or FTC employee for fake help,\u201d the April FTC Consumer Protection report stated.\nScammers will try to get your bank account information by impersonating others. The FTC advises the following ways to protect yourself:\nDon\u2019t respond to messages or click on links from numbers you don\u2019t know.\nBusinesses and government agencies will never ask you to buy gift cards, transfer money or use a bitcoin ATM to resolve a problem. Anyone who asks those things is a scammer.\nCybercriminals will be in a hurry to get your information, so if you feel rushed, it\u2019s likely a scam. Slow down and check out the details they\u2019re giving you. Do not send money or give them personal information.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n5 Things You Should Stop Wasting Money on if Kamala Harris Wins in November, According to Experts\n3 Things to Do This Week If You Have Debt\n9 Cars To Stay Away From In Retirement\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 3 Amazon Scams Retirees Should Be On the Lookout for This Labor Day\n"

        "Author": "  Kyle Wiggers ",
        "Text": "Amazon has released an upgraded version of its in-house image-generating model, Titan Image Generator, for AWS customers using its Bedrock generative AI platform.\nSimply called Titan Image Generator v2, the new model brings with it several new capabilities, AWS principal developer advocate Channy Yun explains in a blog post. Users can \"guide\" the images they generate using reference images, edit existing visuals, remove backgrounds and generate variations of images, says Yun.\n\"Titan Image Generator v2 can intelligently detect and segment multiple foreground objects,\" Yun writes. \"With the Titan Image Generator v2, you can generate color-conditioned images based on a color palette. [And] you can use the image conditioning feature to shape your creations.\"\nTitan Image Generator v2 supports image conditioning, optionally taking in a reference image and focusing on specific visual characteristics in that image, like edges, object outlines and structural elements. The model can also be fine-tuned using reference images like a product or company logo, so that generated images maintain a consistent aesthetic.\nAWS continues to remain vague about which data, exactly, it uses to train its Titan Image Generator models. The company previously told TechCrunch only that it's a combination of proprietary and licensed data.\nFew vendors readily reveal such information; they see training data as a competitive advantage and thus keep it and info relating to it a closely guarded secret. Training data details are also a potential source of IP-related lawsuits, another disincentive to reveal much.\nIn lieu of transparency, AWS offers an indemnification policy that covers customers in the event a Titan model like Titan Image Generator v2 regurgitates (i.e. spits out a mirror copy of) a potentially copyrighted training example.\nIn the company's recent second-quarter earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he's still \"very bullish\" on generative AI tech like AWS' Titan models, despite signs of second-guessing from the enterprise and the mounting costs related to training, fine-tuning and serving models.\n\u201cIn the generative AI space, it's going to get big fast,\" he said, \"and it's largely all going to be built from the get-go in the cloud.\"\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/06/amazon-upgrades-its-ai-image-generator/\n"

        "Title": "Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "With shares down almost 20% in the last 30 days, Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) AI-powered rally is beginning to falter. There are also concerns that a potential economic slowdown could hurt its consumer-driven business model. Let's explore how these near-term challenges could affect the stock's performance over the next three years and beyond.\nIt is impossible to predict the future, but investors should pay attention to macroeconomic factors that could affect their thesis. For Amazon and other consumer-goods-focused companies, the main near-term threat could be a recession, which many economists see as more likely after the July unemployment rate (4.3%) came in higher than expected.\nWhen people lose their jobs, they have less money to spend on online shopping, which leans toward discretionary items over necessities. However, the good news is that Amazon's customers still look strong. \nSecond-quarter revenue increased 10% year over year to $148 billion, driven by expansion in North American and international e-commerce.\nBoth segments are relatively mature, so investors shouldn't expect explosive growth in the future. However, Amazon has focused on juicing profitability through workforce reductions and supply chain efficiency, and these efforts are bearing fruit. Operating income increased 59% to $5.1 billion for North America, while the international segment jumped from a loss of around $900 million to a gain of around $300 million.\nWhile Amazon's e-commerce business has transitioned into a stable cash cow, new segments will help power the next leg of long-term growth. Following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, generative artificial intelligence (AI)-related demand has boosted the company's cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS). \nAWS focuses on the infrastructure side of the AI opportunity, offering clients pre-trained AI services like Amazon Rekognition (which helps with image recognition and video analysis) or Amazon Macie, designed to use machine learning to protect clients' sensitive data.\nAmazon also boasts a foundational large language model (LLM) called Bedrock, which allows clients to create customized conversational algorithms in the same vein as ChatGPT, but trained on their own data.\nAmazon's picks-and-shovels take on AI could shield it from some of the competition on the consumer-facing side of the opportunity. And the fact that these new AI offerings are integrated into the AWS platform could serve as an economic moat by making AWS a one-stop shop for all of a client's cloud-related needs. Segment revenue jumped 19% year over year to $26.3 billion, while operating income surged 72% to $9.3 billion.\nWhile Amazon's e-commerce and cloud computing businesses are looking stronger than ever, the next 12 months could present some challenges. Data analytics company Statista gives the U.S. economy a 52% chance of entering a recession by May 2025.\nEven if a downturn doesn't occur, cracks are beginning to form in the AI growth narrative as consumer-facing start-ups fail to justify their infrastructure spending with revenue and earnings. According to Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss, the industry is debating whether these companies will ever be able to monetize these algorithms, considering the huge amount of capital expenditure needed to train and run them.\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 35, Amazon stock trades at a modest premium over the NASDAQ 100 estimate of 28. This might be a little high considering the near-term challenges it faces. Over the long term, Amazon is still a winner. However, investors may want to wait for a better price before taking a position in the stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "What Amazon taught Robinhood\u2019s CFO about leadership",
        "Author": "  Jeff John Roberts ",
        "Text": "Good morning. It's Fortune finance editor Jeff Roberts pinch-hitting for Sheryl, and I wanted to share some highlights of my recent interview with Jason Warnick. He is the CFO of the fast-growing finance app Robinhood, which he joined in 2018 after almost 20 years at Amazon\u2014a company that has heavily influenced Warnick's approach to his job and whose lessons he still draws upon today.\nOne feature of Amazon's corporate culture that has really stuck with Warnick is how the company walked the walk when it came to leadership principles. While nearly every firm adopts a formal mission or set of principles at some point, it often happens that these become empty words with little effect on executives' day-to-day work. Warnick says this wasn't the case at Amazon.\n\"They recruit people based on these leadership principles. They evaluate people for promotion based on these leadership principles. And you'll often hear in meeting settings how leadership principles are part of the dialogue. It's like, 'I don't think we're holding ourselves to high enough standards'\u2014having high standards was one of the principles,\" said Warnick.\nOther Amazon principles, Warnick explained, included \"customer obsession,\" a bias for action, and expecting executives to be curious and to be correct a lot\u2014but not all\u2014of the time.\nWarnick learned a lot at Amazon, where he served as VP of Finance and Chief of Staff to the CFO. Nonetheless, the move to Robinhood represented a big jump. He not only took on the role of CFO for the first time but did so at a time when Robinhood's revenue and customer base were exploding ahead of its 2021 IPO. Warnick has also had to help Robinhood\u2014a firm that has done more to change how Americans invest than any other in recent memory\u2014navigate a host of regulatory challenges and scrutiny from the media and Congress. In one particularly memorable episode at the height of meme-stock mania, he oversaw a frantic stretch where Robinhood responded to a black swan capital demand by raising $3.4 billion in three days.\nFor Warnick, mentors have played a critical role in his career development. At both Amazon and Robinhood, he has found people who provide important perspectives and advice. In doing so, Warnick discovered an important lesson about the nature of mentoring\u2014one that many young executives should heed.\n\"Mentoring and networking can be easily confused. Particularly when you're a more junior person in your career, you tend to treat mentors as networking opportunities. And so you come in and maybe you talk about a decision you made three months ago, but for a mentor to be really effective, it should be more real time. It's like, I'm in the middle of it right now. And who in my network should I be getting real-time feedback from?\"\nThroughout his career, Warnick has shown a knack for borrowing the best of what he has learned at previous roles and from other companies. Robinhood itself has shown a similar aptitude as, according to Warnick and CEO Vlad Tenev, the company strives to emulate not just Amazon but also what iconic firms like Apple, Tesla and Costco do best. This ability to learn from others is a quality that is likely to serve any company and executive well.

        "Text": "By Jody Godoy\n(Reuters) - An appeals court in Washington, D.C. revived the district's lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc on Thursday, saying it plausibly claimed the online retailer's pricing policies illegally stifle competition.\nThe District of Columbia Court of Appeals reversed a ruling that had dismissed the lawsuit, which accuses Amazon of harming competition through restrictions on its suppliers and third-party sellers on Amazon.com.\nAmazon is currently seeking dismissal of another case involving similar claims by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and more than a dozen states.\nAmazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said the company disagrees with the appeals court ruling and looks forward to proving its policies benefit consumers.\n\"Just like any store owner who wouldn\u2019t want to promote a bad deal to their customers, we don\u2019t highlight or promote offers that are not competitively priced,\" he said.\nD.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb welcomed the court's ruling in a statement.\n\"We will continue fighting to stop Amazon\u2019s unfair and unlawful practices that have raised prices for District consumers and stifled innovation and choice across online retail,\" he said.\nD.C. sued Amazon in May 2021 claiming Amazon effectively bans third party sellers from offering products for less elsewhere by refusing to highlight their listings if they do.\nThe lawsuit also claims Amazon has agreements with wholesalers that guarantee it a minimum profit. As a result, the complaint alleges, if Amazon lowers a price to compete with another online seller, the wholesaler must pay Amazon the difference between the price it sells at and the agreed minimum. These payments are a disincentive for wholesalers to lower prices to compete, the complaint said.\nThe D.C. appeals court said on Thursday the judge who dismissed the case in May 2023 set the bar too high, and the attorney general had a plausible claim the practices harmed competition in the online retail marketplace.\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Chris Reese)\n"

        "Title": "Where Will Amazon Be in 1 Year?",
        "Author": "  Jennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After a steady ascent this year, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock got crushed after it released its second-quarter earnings results last week. The reason? Amazon's guidance didn't impress the market, despite a strong second quarter performance, causing the stock to decline by nearly 13% since, as well as pushing down year-to-date stock gains to just 7% from a peak of 31% last month.\nHowever, investors who take a long-term view of the business know such market movements are short-sighted, since they necessarily take into account only the current snapshot of the company's operations. However, investors do get nervous, because they don't know if this update portends trouble up ahead. So what should investors expect from Amazon, and where will the business be a year from now?\nAmazon reported a 10% year-over-year increase in revenue in the 2024 second quarter, including a 19% increase for Amazon Web services. (AWS). It's investing in all over its business to keep up the momentum, specifically in improving e-commerce and in developing generative artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe market wasn't enthused by management's guidance for third-quarter sales to increase 8% to 11%, but that's within the typical range.\nAmazon generally beats its own expectations. Here's a chart of management's guidance for the past four quarters, along with what actually happened.\nRevenue growth\nQ2 2024\nQ1 2024\nQ4 2023\nQ3 2023\nGuidance range\n7% to 11%\n8% to 13%\n7% to 12%\n9% to 13%\nActual\n10%\n13%\n14%\n13%\nData source: Amazon quarterly reports. Rates are year over year.\nThe second quarter was close to the top of the expected range, but not as much as previous quarters, which came in at the top or beat it entirely. It's likely that Amazon will come in toward the top of guidance in the third quarter, but not a given.\nAmazon keeps getting bigger, and the bigger it gets, the harder it is to build on top in percentage. For example, total sales were $148 billion in the second quarter. While absolute growth isn't impossible, profitability could be lower.\nIn a year from now, Amazon should be a lot bigger, and it could even surpass Walmart to become the largest company in the world by sales.\nAndy Jassy has been curtailing spend in many areas. He cut headcount and spearheaded an e-commerce overhaul that's faster and more efficient. However, management is investing substantially in AWS's AI services as it races with Microsoft and Alphabet to capture market share in the growing and lucrative cloud computing segment.\nIt shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. Aside from the obvious, which is that it's trying to stay on top of the competition, management has made it clear in the past that this is how the model works. It has periods of heavy investments and periods of incredible profitability.\nManagement is guiding operating income between $11.5 billion and $15.0 billion for the third quarter, up from $11.2 billion last year. That's a sharp slowdown. Operating income nearly doubled in the second quarter, and it grew even faster in the previous three quarters.\nWhile it invests in AWS, the e-commerce business is becoming more efficient. That gives it some wiggle room to pump money into generative AI and still report solid operating performance for the whole company. Management said that because of the new regional fulfillment strategy, Amazon is able to consolidate shipments and cut transportation time and fees. That results in lower costs and happier customers.\nAmazon's high-margin advertising business, now reported as a separate segment, once again registered the highest growth among segment, with sales up 20% more than last year. However, that's a deceleration from previous quarters, and it's something to keep an eye on over the next year. Management sees a tremendous opportunity in video streaming ads, which it's just getting started with.\nIn a year from now, the generative AI business is likely to still be at the forefront of the industry, and Amazon's focus specifically. It should, however, achieve its intent of onboarding new business and benefiting from increased client spend. Management said that it continues to see businesses ending their cost optimization efforts, and since 90% of spend is still not in the cloud, the opportunity is enormous. AWS is also a high-margin business, and its growth could eclipse the impact of Amazon's investments.\nAmazon is growing its other businesses, too. Its pharmacy division is taking off, and it's producing hit streaming content through Amazon MGM Studios. In a year from now, these should continue to grow, and Amazon is likely to roll out new services and businesses.\nWhen you're looking to invest, it's important to look for patterns. Does Amazon usually beat guidance? Will Amazon go through compression periods as it builds to come out stronger? Does it bounce back from setbacks? And finally, is management capable of rolling out new products and services profitably? The answer to all of those questions is yes, and Amazon is a great long-term buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

However, small retailers have often alleged that the regulations are bypassed using complicated business structures.\nCommerce Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday signalled out Amazon's business practices and said the company's investments in India have often been used to cover its business losses.\nGoyal, however, did not provide any evidence to substantiate the claim.\n\"When Amazon says we are going to invest a billion dollars in India and we all celebrate, we forget the underlying story that the billion dollars is not coming in for any great service,\" Goyal said at an event in New Delhi, where he did not name any other company.\nDo the losses \"not smell of predatory pricing to any of you ... what was that loss for, they are not allowed to sell to consumers (directly),\" he added.\nAmazon and Flipkart did not respond to requests for comment.\nAmazon in June last year said it will increase its India investments to $26 billion by 2030, including for its cloud business. It is also targeting merchandise exports worth $20 billion from India by 2025.\nGoyal has in the past attacked U.S. e-commerce giants publicly. In 2021, he said companies were using their scale and access to large pools of low-cost capital \"to the detriment of mom-and-pop stores\" and that they \"very blatantly flouted\" laws.\nA Reuters special report in 2021 found Amazon's internal documents showed the U.S. e-commerce company helped a small number of sellers prosper on its Indian platform, gave them discounted fees and used them to bypass foreign investment laws.\nAmazon had then said that it is confident of local law compliance and it \"does not give preferential treatment to any seller\".\nSubsequently, though, it was announced that two of Amazon's big sellers facing such allegations will stop selling products on its website.\n\"They create entities ... when they get caught they start closing down those entities,\" Goyal said on Wednesday.\nAmazon and Flipkart are also facing an antitrust investigation in India but deny any wrongdoing.\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Shivangi Acharya; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)\n"

        "Title": "Amazon flying to generate 20% of Sun Country Airlines\u2019 revenue",
        "Author": "  Eric Kulisch ",
        "Text": "Cargo revenue at Sun Country Airlines inched up in the second quarter despite reduced flight activity on behalf of Amazon, but is expected to jump one year from now when the retail giant supplies additional Boeing 737-800 freighters to the carrier.\nThe two companies in late June agreed on an expanded transportation services agreement under which Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) will deliver eight Boeing 737-800 converted cargo jets it controls through a long-term lease to support package deliveries in its domestic logistics network.\nThe planes will be pulled from current contractor Atlas Air, and transferred to Sun Country starting in March of 2025. The date range provided in Friday\u2019s briefing with analysts was more specific than previous statements that the leisure airline would begin operating the initial aircraft in the first quarter, with the remainder of the planes delivered on a rolling basis by the third quarter.\nMinneapolis-based Sun Country (NASDAQ: SNCY) on Thursday reported cargo revenue of $25 million, up 1.7% from the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to an annual rate escalation that went into effect in December. Cargo flight hours dipped 2.4% to accommodate scheduled heavy maintenance, but are expected to grow in the third and fourth quarters.\nSun Country has operated a dozen Amazon-supplied Boeing narrowbody cargo jets since 2020. The revised contract for crews, maintenance and insurance to operate the eight additional cargo jets was also extended through 2030 and gives Sun Country better rates, in addition to increasing its freighter fleet to 20 aircraft.\n\u201cSun Country\u2019s cargo segment will become a larger portion of our business starting in mid-2025. By 2026, we expect revenue from our cargo segment to be almost 20% of our total revenue, versus approximately 10% in 2024. The expansion of our cargo segment comes with almost no required capex and drives improved profitability and greater free cash flow,\u201d said Chief Financial Officer Dave Davis on the earnings call.\nCargo\u2019s share of operating revenue at large U.S. passenger carriers that don\u2019t operate dedicated freighters is about 3% in a typical year.\nManagement stressed that the Amazon deal will further diversify Sun Country\u2019s revenue base, placing less reliance on the volatile scheduled passenger and charter business to vacation destinations.\nAs previously announced, the airline will temporarily suspend service to some markets next year so pilots and other resources can focus on ramping up the Amazon cargo service.\nSun Country said overall revenue fell 2.6% to $254 million during the quarter. Sales were hurt by overcapacity across the domestic industry and by flight cancellations in late June. The company was able to lower unit costs by nearly 5% compared to the prior year. Net income dropped 91% to $1.8 million, the company\u2019s eighth consecutive quarter of profitability.\nSun Country\u2019s cargo revenue in 2023 increased 10.4% year over year to $100 million while most of the air cargo industry, including express air carriers, experienced downturns in aircraft utilization and revenue. The airline benefited from Amazon gaining share in a declining domestic parcel market, where it overtook FedEx and UPS last year in total deliveries. First-quarter cargo revenue at Sun Country increased 2.5%, to $24 million, from the same period a year ago.\nClick here for more FreightWaves/American Shipper stories by Eric Kulisch.\nTwitter: @ericreports / LinkedIn: Eric Kulisch / ekulisch@freightwaves.com\nAmazon transferring Boeing 737-800 cargo jets to Sun Country Airlines\nThe post Amazon flying to generate 20% of Sun Country Airlines\u2019 revenue appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 12, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: International Business Machines Corporation IBM, Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s AMZN and Microsoft Corporation\u2019s MSFT.\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nInternational Business Machines Corporationrecently augmented the generative AI capabilities of its managed Threat Detection and Response Services with the launch of the IBM Consulting Cybersecurity Assistant.\nDesigned to accelerate and improve the identification, investigation and response to critical security threats, the Cybersecurity Assistant will form an integral part of IBM's watsonx data and AI platform along with IBM Consulting Advantage. This, in turn, is expected to empower IBM consultants to respond more proactively and precisely to critical cyber threats with consistency, repeatability, quality and agility.\nThe Cybersecurity Assistant includes a generative AI conversational engine with real-time insights and support on operational tasks to both clients and IBM security analysts. Utilizing IBM's broader generative AI capabilities that are built on the company's Granite foundation models and watsonx.ai platform, it can continuously learn from investigations, leading to faster response and accuracy with time.\nLeveraging historical correlation analysis of similar threats, the Cybersecurity Assistant will aim to provide a holistic and integrative threat management approach to help security analysts better comprehend critical threats. In addition, it will reduce manual investigations and operational tasks with auto-recommend actions based on the historical patterns of analyzed activity and pre-set confidence levels. This, in turn, will help to effectively mitigate multi-dimensional cyber threats that have become rampant over time.\nIn March, IBM took a giant step forward in enterprise AI innovation by integrating the open-source Mixtral-8x7B large language model into its watsonx AI and data platform. Built on innovative Sparse modeling and the Mixture-of-Experts technique, this model excels in rapid data processing and contextual analysis. Its ability to efficiently handle vast datasets makes it a valuable asset for businesses seeking actionable insights.\nIBM\u2019s Watsonx platform is likely to be the core technology platform for its AI capabilities. Watsonx delivers the value of foundational models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive. This enterprise-ready AI and data platform comprises three products to help organizations accelerate and scale AI \u2014 the watsonx.ai studio for new foundation models, generative AI and machine learning; the watsonx.data fit-for-purpose data store, built on an open lake house architecture; and the watsonx.governance toolkit to help enable AI workflows to be built with responsibility and transparency.\nDespite solid hybrid cloud and AI traction, IBM is facing stiff competition from Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corporation\u2019s Azure. Increasing pricing pressure is eroding margins and profitability has mostly trended down over the years, barring occasional spikes. The company\u2019s ongoing, heavily time-consuming business model transition to the cloud is a challenging task. Weakness in its traditional business and foreign exchange volatility remain significant concerns.\nOver the past year, IBM has gained 34.5% compared with the industry\u2019s growth of 18.9%, outperforming its peers.\nFrom a valuation standpoint, IBM appears to be trading at a premium relative to the industry and is trading well above its mean. Going by the price/earnings ratio, the company shares currently trade at 18.69 forward earnings, higher than 17.14 for the industry and the stock\u2019s mean of 12.64.\nIBM aims to benefit from the increasing propensity of business enterprises to undertake a cloud-agnostic and interoperable approach to secure multi-cloud management with a diligent focus on hybrid cloud and generative AI solutions. A better business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity gains and increased investments in growth opportunities are key growth drivers.\nHowever, with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), IBM appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and new investors could be better off if they trade with caution. It is also trading at premium valuation metrics and investors could wait for a better entry point to cash in on its long-term fundamentals. Consequently, it might not be a prudent investment decision to bet on the stock at the moment.

        "Text": "Most artificial intelligence (AI) development happens in the cloud, with the help of tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) operate centralized data centers filled with chips from leading suppliers like Nvidia, and they rent the computing power to developers who use it to create AI applications.\nPlus, developers can access ready-made large language models on Azure and AWS, including those from leading AI start-ups like OpenAI and Anthropic, to accelerate their progress.\nAWS is the largest provider of cloud services and infrastructure in the world, followed by Azure in second place. However, Azure grew its revenue by 29% in the most recent quarter (ended June 30), with eight percentage points attributed to AI alone. AWS only grew its revenue by 19% during the same period, and the gap, while narrowing, has been a consistent theme:\nMicrosoft doesn't disclose how much revenue Azure brings in, but it recently said the cloud platform was responsible for about half of its \"Microsoft Cloud\" revenue. During the latest quarter, Microsoft Cloud generated $36.8 billion in revenue, implying Azure probably generated around $18.4 billion.\nThat means it has a way to go to catch AWS, which generated $26.3 billion in revenue during its latest quarter. But with the current 10% growth differential, Azure could overtake AWS within five years -- and possibly even sooner if the growth gap widens to where it was earlier this year.\nMicrosoft became an early mover in the AI race when it agreed to invest $10 billion in OpenAI in 2023. The start-up's latest GPT-4o models are among the best in the industry, and they are now available on Azure. That could be a key consideration for developers when selecting a cloud provider.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 19, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN.\nLast week the market experienced its sharpest correction of the year, with the VIX index shooting above 60 and the broad market falling more than 10% in just a few weeks. But the buying impulse has been even more surprising as the V-shaped recovery has caught many investors off guard.\nIn hindsight, it seems that the intense selling seen last Monday may have been a one-off event, with unwind of the Japanese carry trade causing a capitulation among the most levered traders. Even though stocks have rapidly appreciated from last week\u2019s lows, many are still on sale, most notably stocks from the Magnificent 7, which make up the largest and some of the best performing in the market.\nLooking back to last week\u2019s lows, we can see which of the group has rallied the most. Relative strength is one of my favorite ways to find winning stocks as it often points to those with the most momentum and investor interest. Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Amazon have seen the fastest gains since the lows, leading me to believe they may continue to lead the Mag 7 and the broad market.\nIt can be hard to buy stocks right after they have run up, but history tells us that strength often begets more strength. However, markets don\u2019t move in a straight line and if it is difficult to pull the trigger on these stocks, there is nothing wrong for waiting on a pullback. But when the pullback does eventually come, you must have the courage to execute the plan.\nBut how can investors be confident when buying pullbacks? If you take inventory of the broader picture, the economy and stock market should be conducive for the foreseeable future, giving investors security when buying.\nThe economy is growing above trend and remained robust throughout the Fed raising cycle, earnings are growing nicely, and we can expect lower interest rates in the near future. With lower interest rates, we can expect the economy to begin expanding again, which should encourage profit growth at corporations and even some multiple expansion in stock valuations.\nIf we look at the seasonality chart, we can see that there may be some weakness in stocks in the second half of September into October. Additionally, with the US presidential election looming this fall, there may be some additional pangs of uncertainty, possibly adding to any temporary selloffs.\nThus, if we don\u2019t get any pullbacks over the next week or two, investors can remain patient as there should be more buying opportunities before the year end.\nSo, we covered why investors can be confident that the broad market should hold up, but what about Nvidia, Amazon and Meta Platforms are still so appealing as investments? More than anything, these companies are growing profits at truly incredible rates, especially for their immense size.\nAlthough each of these companies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting flat earnings revisions trends, the earnings growth forecasts are more than reason enough to consider buying. Earnings per share (EPS) are projected to grow 37.6% annually at Nvidia, 27.4% annually at Amazon and 19% annually at Meta Platforms over the next three to five years. While not a perfect comparison, stocks typically appreciate in line with their earnings growth over the long term, which could translate to impressive price gains for these companies.\nThese companies sit directly in the front seat of the most important secular business and technology trends, which is why they expect such impressive growth. From Artificial Intelligence, to cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital communities, they will be the leaders in these high growth high profit businesses.\nFurthermore, they all have fairly reasonable valuations, especially compared to historical averages. Meta platforms is trading at 25.3x, right in line with its 10-year median, Amazon is trading at 36.7x, well below its 10-year median of 93.6x and Nvidia is trading at 48.5x, just above its 10-year median of 42.7x.\nWhile the recent market recovery has been swift and robust, it's crucial to remember that the market can be unpredictable. Although the economic environment and earnings growth for companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms remain favorable, markets don't move in a straight line. There could be pullbacks, especially with seasonal trends and the upcoming election adding potential volatility.\nHowever, when these pullbacks occur, they should be seen as opportunities for disciplined investors to enter or add to positions in high-quality stocks. Always prioritize risk management and ensure that your investment decisions align with your long-term goals, as the market will do what it wants, regardless of expectations.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) both posted their latest earnings reports on Aug. 1. Amazon's stock dipped after it missed analysts' revenue estimates and provided soft guidance for the current quarter, but Apple's stock held steady after it followed up its earnings beat with a stable near-term outlook.\nShould investors buy Apple and avoid Amazon? Let's take a fresh look at both companies' near-term challenges and valuations to find out.\nAmazon's revenue rose 10% year over year to $148 billion in the second quarter of 2024 but missed analysts' expectations by $760 million. That revenue miss was caused by the slowing growth of its North American and international retail segments, which offset the accelerating growth of its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform.\nGrowth by Segment (YOY)\nQ2 2023\nQ3 2023\nQ4 2023\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nNorth America revenue\n11%\n11%\n13%\n12%\n9%\nInternational revenue\n10%\n16%\n17%\n10%\n7%\nAWS revenue\n12%\n12%\n13%\n17%\n19%\nTotal revenue\n11%\n13%\n14%\n13%\n10%\nData source: Amazon. YOY = Year over year.\nAmazon blamed its retail slowdown on tougher macro headwinds for consumer spending and lower average selling prices for bargain-hunting shoppers. It also said recent events -- including the U.S. presidential election, the attempted assassination of former President Trump, and the Paris Olympics -- were distracting shoppers and disrupting their online purchases.\nTougher competition from aggressive cross-border e-commerce competitors like Shein and PDD's Temu could be another major issue. All those challenges also throttled the growth of the company's integrated advertising services.\nOn the bright side, AWS' accelerating growth indicates the world's largest cloud platform continues to flourish -- even as it faces intense competition from Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's\u00a0Google Cloud. During the conference call, CEO Andy Jassy attributed a lot of that growth to the \"generative AI [artificial intelligence] boom,\" which is driving more companies to upgrade their cloud infrastructure services. AWS also has much higher operating margins than Amazon's e-commerce marketplaces, so it can still subsidize the expansion of its lower-margin businesses.\nAmazon expects its revenue to rise 8% to 11% year over year in the third quarter, but that midpoint missed analysts' estimates for 11% growth. For now, analysts expect the company's revenue and earnings to grow 11% and 58%, respectively, for the full year.\nApple's revenue rose 5% year over year to $85.8 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on June 29) and exceeded analysts' estimates by $1.4 billion. In the first nine months of the fiscal year, the company generated 52% of its revenue from the iPhone, 24% of its revenue from services (including its App Store and subscription-based platforms), and the remaining 24% from its Macs, iPads, and wearables, home, and accessories segments.\nGrowth by Segment (YOY)\nQ3 2023\nQ4 2023\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\niPhone revenue\n(2%)\n3%\n6%\n(10%)\n(1%)\nServices revenue\n8%\n16%\n11%\n14%\n14%\nMac revenue\n(7%)\n(34%)\n1%\n4%\n2%\niPad revenue\n(20%)\n(10%)\n(25%)\n(17%)\n24%\nWearables, home, and accessories revenue\n2%\n(3%)\n(11%)\n(10%)\n(2%)\nTotal revenue\n(1%)\n(1%)\n2%\n(4%)\n5%\nData source: Apple. Fiscal year ends in September. YOY = Year over year.\nApple's services segment was the only business that consistently grew over the past year. But that closely watched segment, which now serves more than 1 billion subscribers, faces unpredictable antitrust challenges in the U.S. and Europe as regulators probe its prioritization of first-party apps, developer restrictions, and high App Store fees.\nApple's iPhone sales slowed down as the 5G upgrade cycle ended. The company also faced tougher competition in China, and the strong dollar reduced overseas sales. But Mac sales -- which had experienced a growth spurt during the pandemic -- finally stabilized, as the company rolled out its new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Its iPad sales also finally rose again in the first quarter as the company launched the new iPad Air and iPad Pro.\nApple expects its growth to stabilize as it rolls out the iPhone 16 in September, ramps up expansion into India, and locks more users into its services ecosystem with a new batch of generative AI tools. It also continues to plow billions of dollars into its earnings-per-share (EPS) boosting buybacks. Analysts expect revenue and earnings to rise 8% and 16%, respectively, for the full year.\nAmazon and Apple both face macro and competitive challenges, but the market seemed more disappointed by Amazon's slowing e-commerce sales than Apple's sluggish iPhone sales. Neither of these stocks is cheap right now. Amazon trades at 39 times forward earnings, while Apple has a slightly lower forward multiple of 30.\nI own both of these stocks, but I'm not in a hurry to add more shares or trim my existing positions. But if I had to buy more shares of one over the other right now, I'd pick Apple instead of Amazon. It trades at a lower multiple, faces fewer near-term challenges, and has more visible catalysts on the horizon.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is Amazon Alexa the Best AI Assistant in 2024?",
        "Author": "  Fatima Gulzar ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best AI Assistants in 2024.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon Alexa stands against the other AI assistants.\nAs we have mentioned in our article, \u201c10 Most Popular AI Penny Stocks Under $1,\" the estimated value of the global artificial intelligence market in 2023 was $196.63 billion, and between 2024 and 2030, it is expected to increase at a CAGR of 36.6%.\nRegionally, in terms of revenue, the North American AI market held a 30.9% share in 2023, while from 2024 to 2030, the artificial intelligence industry in Europe is expected to grow at a significant CAGR of 33.2%, per Grand View Research. Moreover, the artificial intelligence and robotics markets in the United States have advanced significantly, with an estimated valuation of $42.00 billion in 2023.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau survey indicates that industry-specific AI adoption rates differ. The information and professional, scientific, and technical services sectors dominate in this regard, with 18% and 12% of businesses reporting present use of AI, respectively, while agriculture and construction have low AI adoption rates of 1% each.\nWith the launch of ChatGPT, AI technologies are still at the forefront of AI market trends. After launching in November 2022, OpenAI claims that ChatGPT, its AI tool, attracted over a million users in just five days. The Head of AI & Data at Deloitte Switzerland, Marc Beierschoder, is unequivocal on the significance of AI in day-to-day business, stating that \"AI is not a passing fad.\" In the distant past, a dazzling toy that would momentarily enhance a company's reputation for innovation has evolved into a vital instrument for smooth corporate operations. Particularly, employees are already accustomed to using generative AI technologies like ChatGPT and DALL-E, which generate fresh content in the form of text, photos, audio files, or videos.\nIf 2023 was the year that generative AI (Gen AI) was first introduced to the world, then 2024 is the year that businesses really started utilizing this new technology and reaping its benefits. According to the McKinsey Global AI May 30, 2024 Survey, 65% of participants claimed their companies use generative artificial intelligence on a regular basis. This is almost twice as many as the survey's results from just 10 months ago. Respondents' expectations for Gen AI's impact are as high as they were last year, with three-quarters forecasting major or disruptive change in their industry in the next years.\nAnother study by PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence, \"Sizing the Prize: Exploiting the AI Revolution,\" examines the enormous potential that artificial intelligence holds for economies and businesses. According to the study, artificial intelligence could boost GDP in local economies by up to 26% and add an incredible $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. As businesses look to \"augment\" the productivity of their labor force using AI technology and automate some jobs and roles, advances in labor productivity will fuel initial GDP growth. Additionally, the analysis indicates that by 2030, improvements to products will drive up consumer demand and account for 45% of all economic gains. This is due to the fact that AI will eventually lead to a wider range of products that are more affordable, individualized, and attractive. China and North America stand to gain the most from AI, with China's GDP expected to rise by 26% and 14.5%, respectively, to reach a total of $10.7 trillion, which represents over 70% of the global economic impact.\nTo pick out the 11 Best AI Assistants in 2024, we searched the internet for the best AI assistants in 2024 and ranked them based on their number of appearances in our sources, so each appearance got one Insider Monkey score. Then we ranked the list based on the aggregated scores.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nInsider Monkey Score: 14\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s AI virtual speech assistant service, Alexa, is accessible on over 100 million devices made by Amazon and other manufacturers. It's intended to assist consumers in purchasing Amazon things, playing music, and controlling smart home gadgets (Echo). Many IoT devices and Amazon items come pre-installed with it. The Echo Show 8 is the most recent Alexa show device.\nIn its May 2024 investor letter, Lakehouse Global Growth Fund provided an update on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), sharing their analysis and perspective on the company\u2019s performance and future prospects:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered an impressive quarterly result that also came in well ahead of analyst expectations. Net sales increased 13% year-on-year to $143.3 billion and operating profits increased 219% year-on-year to $15.3 billion (vs the high end of guidance at $12.0 billion). As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U.S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the best AI assistants in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Why Is It the Best Self Driving Car Stock to Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Talha Qureshi ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other self driving car stocks.\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence, data analysis, and machine learning are shaping how industries perform today. These three technological advancements have enhanced the potential of autonomous vehicles and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).\nHowever, are the consumers ready to put their hands off the driving wheel and trust self-driving vehicles? Let\u2019s explore how the autonomous driving industry is progressing with almost all major automotive manufacturers investing significantly to put their Full Self Driving (FSD) cars on the road.\nAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global autonomous vehicle market is valued at $41.10 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22.75% to reach $114.54 billion by 2029. The COVID-19 pandemic hindered the overall output of the automotive industry thereby delaying the production and roll-out of self-driving cars. In addition, increased government regulations to ensure road safety have also proved to be a barrier for automakers. However, with significant improvement in software and hardware technology backed by artificial intelligence, we see automakers rolling out their Level 2 and Level 3 autonomous cars on public roads.\nFor instance, on June 25 CNBC reported that Waymo a leading autonomous vehicle company, opened its self-driving robot taxis for users in San Francisco. The company claims that more than 300,000 people signed up for the service. To cater for the growing number of users Waymo One has rolled out a fleet of 300 cars in the city.\nAccording to a survey by McKinsey & Company, automotive market leaders believe the autonomous segment to be less fragmented due to the complexity and investment involved in its operations. As per the survey, 15% of the respondents believe North America will have most companies working and deploying autonomous technology in the future. In contrast, 38% of respondents believe the European market to be led by at most two or three companies.\nRegionally speaking, China and North America are leading the race to become the first countries to roll out Level 4 highway pilot technology. Respondents of the survey are equally divided with 58% believing either country could be the first in Level 4 technology.\nAs mentioned above, developing and rolling out autonomous vehicles requires a huge investment in software technology. However, the investment is also expected to return high margins. The survey found that experts believe autonomous vehicle software is expected to have an average margin of 15% and hardware technology will add another 10% to the margin, thereby making the autonomous vehicle segment a lucrative venture for automotive companies.\nEmerging trends in the autonomous vehicle industry are paving the way towards achieving level 5 autonomy. Some of the latest developments in the industry include, the use of Internet of Things (IoT) to allow vehicles to connect with other vehicles, its environment, and the internet. This not only improves the vehicle safety by providing quick data acquisition and analysis to make timely decisions based on the traffic changes on the road. New sensor technologies such as the LiDAR scans the surrounding of the car using laser technology. When these LiDAR sensors move continuously using multiple laser sensors they create a 3D representation of the surrounding ensuring the vehicle drives safely without collision. Almost all level 3 autonomous vehicles use LiDAR scanners to enhance vehicle visibility to around 300 meters during daytime.\nMoreover, advancements in artificial intelligence such as object detection algorithms along with the LiDAR help the vehicle detect pedestrians, traffic signs, and other vehicles on the road. Other deep learning algorithms are helping improve the user experience by enhanced voice recognition, gesture recognition, and sentiment analysis to help interact with the vehicle efficiently. Last but not the least, Big Data analysis techniques are being utilized by autonomous automakers to improve vehicle autonomy through analyzing data collected through radars, scanners, and cameras.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the 10 best self-driving car stocks to buy, we looked at autonomous driving stock holdings of the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF. We selected the top 20 stocks from the ETF holdings and ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q1 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates in the retail sale of consumer products in North America and internationally. The company also offers Amazon Web Services and manufactures and sells electronic devices. The stock was held by 302 hedge funds in Q1 2024, with total stakes worth $60.37 billion. Diamond Hill Capital is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $474.3 million.\nThe company expanded its operations in the autonomous vehicle segment when it acquired Zoox in 2020. Since then the company has made significant strides in autonomous vehicles and is developing fully autonomous robot taxis. Zoox unlocked a key milestone in February 2023, when it released its fully automated robot taxi on the roads of Foster City, California. Unlike its competitors, Zoox taxis are completely autonomous and have space for 4 adult passengers.\nMoreover, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also plays a critical role in developing and deploying Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). AWS offers a range of solutions tailored for the autonomous mobility industry, enabling companies to develop, test, and deploy their self-driving technologies efficiently. The company has entered into notable strategic partnerships with BMW, Lyft and Toyota for data processing, machine learning, and simulation capabilities.\nThe company posted a successful second quarter of 2024. Net sales of the company increased 11% year-over-year to reach $148 billion. Net sales were driven by strong growth in the AWS segment and grew 19% year-over-year to reach $26.3 billion. The AWS segment, which also provides ADAS to automotive companies, was able to grow its operational income by 7.2% subsequently reaching $9.3 billion.\nWhat sets Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) apart from its competitors is its robust cloud infrastructure, which provides scalable computing power, storage, and advanced data analytics capabilities. For instance, Amazon EC2 enables high-performance computing, Amazon S3 allows data storage, and Amazon SageMaker service has accelerated the autonomous driving capabilities of its subsidiary Zoox.\nAmazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has grown its top line by 22% and bottom line by 74% during the last 10 years. 65 analysts have a Strong Buy rating on the stock, with their 12-month median price target of $220 presenting an upside of 32% from current levels.\nDiamond Hill Select Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\nAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Texas Instruments and Mr. Cooper Group. Internet retail and cloud infrastructure company Amazon is benefiting from strong profitability, particularly in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business. Shares also received a boost amid growing optimism around the demand for AWS as Amazon customers\u2019 investments in generative AI projects continue growing.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best self driving car stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "The Bull Market Keeps Growing. 3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Like There's No Tomorrow.",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "For those new to investing, a bull market is generally a sustained period of growth over several months or sometimes years. It officially starts when stock prices rise 20% from a recent low.\nThe chart below shows the S&P 500 hit its lowest point in October 2022 and has consistently risen since then, spurring a bull market.\nThe S&P 500 has risen about 55% since October 2022, driven by easing inflation and the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). The index has made a solid recovery and likely isn't done yet. Earnings season kicked off this month, proving companies across tech are beginning to enjoy major gains from their investments in AI.\nAs a result, it's likely not too late to profit from the bull market. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is an attractive option, with its stock slightly beating the S&P 500 since the bull market's beginning, rising 57%. The company is home to a potent business with growth catalysts across tech.\nSo, get in while the bull market is still growing. Here are three reasons to buy Amazon stock like there's no tomorrow.\nInterest in AI has spiked since the start of last year, motivating countless tech companies to restructure their businesses to prioritize the industry. Cloud computing became a crucial growth area for AI, with many businesses turning to the top cloud platforms to integrate the technology into their workflows.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has a leading 31% market share in cloud computing and has staunchly invested in AI. Since the start of 2023, Amazon has added a range of new AI tools to AWS and expanded the platform's reach by sinking billions into opening data centers at home and abroad. According to a Bloomberg report from March, Amazon plans to spend close to $150 billion over the next 15 years on data centers as it expects an explosion of demand for AI cloud services.\nIn addition to AWS, Amazon is enhancing other areas of its business with generative features. Earlier this year, the company launched its AI assistant, Rufus, designed to improve shoppers' experience on its e-commerce site. Meanwhile, AI helps the company better track shopping trends, recommend products, and deal with shipping/warehouse logistics.\nAmazon's success over the years is primarily thanks to consistent reinvestment in its business, which has seen it expand to multiple markets. In addition to online retail and AWS, the company has solid positions in grocery, video streaming, gaming, healthcare, and more. The company makes a point of keeping up with current tech trends, which recently led it to expand its role in the $740 billion digital advertising market.\nThe high costs of content production and running a demanding site for video streaming have seen many companies struggle to profit in the space. As a result, multiple entertainment firms have turned to ads to boost earnings. Netflix, Disney, and Comcast have all launched ad-supported tiers on their respective streaming platforms over the last year, partnering with advertising leaders like Alphabet and Microsoft.\nAmazon also joined this year, introducing ads to its Prime Video streaming service. The move quickly paid off, diversifying its revenue streams and exposing it to another high-growth sector. Ad revenue increased by 20% in the second quarter of 2024, boosted by Prime Video ads.\nPrime Video achieved more than 200 million subscribers this year, accounting for 22% of the streaming market (tied with Netflix in market share). Amazon's vast user base is an excellent tool for attracting advertisers, allowing it to continue expanding its digital ad earnings and potentially charge a premium for its services.\nAmazon's shares are up 33% year over year, outperforming the S&P 500's 28% rise. The company has rallied investors with impressive earnings gains, an expanding role in AI, and unexpected growth in digital advertising.\nMeanwhile, the chart below suggests Amazon is a bargain compared to its growth prospects.\nAmazon's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is high at 42. However, that figure is significantly lower than its 10-year average, a period when the company's stock price rose 958%. Meanwhile, Amazon's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio sits at an attractive three and is similarly below its 10-year average.\nAlongside an exciting outlook in AI and a budding ad business, Amazon's stock is an excellent way to take advantage of the current bull market.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "It's hard to overstate the degree to which artificial intelligence (AI) has altered the technology landscape since early last year, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the ranks of the world's most valuable businesses.\nWhile the No. 1 position has changed hands several times over the past 12 months, it's currently occupied by Apple. The company's recent AI announcements have energized the Apple faithful, driving its market cap to $3.4 trillion.\nWith its full-court press into AI, Microsoft takes up the No. 2 spot at $3.1 trillion. Nvidia, with its industry-leading AI chip, has doubled over the past year to earn the No. 3 spot at $2.9 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- each with solid AI game plans of their own -- are also members of this exclusive fraternity, with market caps of $2.1 trillion, $1.9 trillion, and $1.2 trillion, respectively (as of market close on Wednesday).\nWith a market cap of just $41 billion, it might seem like an exaggeration to suggest that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, might have a shot at joining the $1 trillion club. However, the strong, accelerating demand for servers designed to harness the power of AI -- and the company's years of experience in the field -- suggest Supermicro might have the qualities needed for membership.\nWhile Supermicro has only recently caught the attention of AI-centric investors, the company has been serving up custom-designed servers for more than three decades. This track record of experience served Supermicro well when those wanting to harness the power of generative AI came calling.\nThe company's claim to fame is its track record of developing power-miserly, rack-scale servers that boast a lower cost of ownership. Yet these cost-efficient systems are still able to provide the computational horsepower necessary to harness the power of AI and hyperscale data centers.\nFurthermore, Supermicro's building-block architecture ensures it can create a system to accommodate any budget or technology level. Finally, partnerships with the most important names in AI chips, including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others, ensure a steady supply of the most in-demand processors.\nThis successful strategy has helped generate meteoric growth. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), revenue surged 200% year over year to $3.8 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $6.56 soared 329%. Management is forecasting its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year revenue guidance to $14.9 billion, which would represent growth of 109%.\nManagement said Supermicro grew 5 times faster than the industry average over the preceding 12 months, suggesting the company is gaining market share. Analysts at Northland came to the same conclusion, noting the company has increased its market share from 8% to 11%, with \"plenty of room for future share gains.\"\nFinally, in a nod to Supermicro's importance within the broader market, the stock was added to the Nasdaq-100 Index on July 22.\nSupermicro has the inside track when compared to its rivals. When demand for AI servers ratcheted up last year, the company was nimble enough to adjust on the fly. Its strong relationships with all the top AI chipmakers gave Supermicro a steady supply of the processors needed to outfit its high-end servers. That said, it will be some time before Supermicro achieves the title of trillionaire.\nAccording to Wall Street, Supermicro is on track to deliver revenue of $14.9 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 2.75. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $363 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. Still, those days are a long way off, as Supermicro is scrambling to increase its production capacity to support sales of $25 billion.\nIf the company can keep up its triple-digit year-over-year growth, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap as soon as 2029. However, even the bulls concede that maintaining growth of that magnitude is unlikely to happen. What's more likely is that the growth rate tapers off to a more manageable 50%, in which case Supermicro could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2032.\nSome on Wall Street believe the demand for AI-capable servers will continue for years. Bank of America analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya calculates the market will increase at a compound annual growth rate of 50% over the next three years, maintaining that Supermicro's revenue could \"grow even faster.\"\nThis helps underscore the massive opportunity. If Supermicro captures just a small part of that windfall, the company will be a member of the $1 trillion club in short order.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Greg Bensinger and Deborah Mary Sophia ",
        "Text": "By Greg Bensinger and Deborah Mary Sophia\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com reported slowing online sales growth in the second quarter and said cautious consumers were seeking out cheaper options for purchases, sending shares down nearly 8%.\nThe after-hours stock drop came despite second-quarter profit and cloud computing sales that beat analyst estimates. Amazon shares had gained over 20% this year through the session close on Thursday, and investors were disappointed that the company forecast current-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates.\nAmazon's CFO, Brian Olsavsky, told reporters on a call that consumers \"are continuing to be cautious with their spending trading down.\"\nHe added, \"They are looking for deals,\" and noted that lower priced products were selling briskly.\nCEO Andy Jassy agreed, adding on a call with analysts that customers were trading down on price when they could. Amazon's online retail business has faced heightened competition from budget retailers like Temu and Shein, which sell a wide variety of goods at bargain-basement prices direct from China.\nThe comments echoed similar ones from Oreo-maker Mondelez, PepsiCo and Kraft, which in recent days highlighted challenges facing American consumers.\nAmazon\u2019s online stores sales rose 5% in the second quarter to $55.4 billion, compared with growth of 7% in the first quarter.\nOne analyst said slowing retail sales growth was driving the post-market shares sell-off.\n\"They're showing continued momentum on cloud in terms of re-acceleration and so that's certainly where I think investors will be more positive, but the retail aspect is definitely what's weighing on the stock right now,\" said Charles Rogers, analyst at M Science.\n\"We're continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued re-acceleration in AWS growth,\" Jassy said in a release announcing the results.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud business.\nOlsavsky told reporters it was difficult to make predictions for the third quarter because events like the presidential election and the Olympics in Paris were distracting consumers. He said Amazon\u2019s two-day discount sales event known as Prime Day in July was its \"biggest ever,\" without providing specifics.\nOn Wednesday, Kraft said it has had to offer more entry-level price points, expand its range of Oscar Mayer products at dollar stores and introduce Capri Sun multi-serve bottles because more shoppers were seeking value.\nPLAYING CATCHUP ON AI\nLike other big tech companies, Amazon is boosting capital expenditures to invest in infrastructure for and development of artificial intelligence. Olsavsky said spending in this year\u2019s first six months was about $30.5 billion, suggesting about $16.5 billion in the second quarter.\nSeattle-based Amazon is playing catchup with rivals Microsoft, which partners with OpenAI, and Google in developing its own so-called large language models that can respond nearly instantly to complicated queries or prompts.\nIt has rolled out a chatbot, dubbed Rufus, designed to help customers make purchasing decisions for specific purposes.\nBoth Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft cautioned investors last month that expenses would remain elevated throughout the year to support developing pricey AI software and services. Investors took that as a signal that a payoff from the buzzy technology could take longer than originally hoped.\nAmazon Web Services reported a 19% increase in revenue to $26.3 billion for the second quarter, surpassing market estimates of $25.95 billion.\nThe company expects revenue of $154.0 billion to $158.5 billion for the third quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of $158.24 billion, according to LSEG data.\nAmazon also missed estimates for advertising sales, a closely watched metric, as it ramps up competition with rivals Meta Platforms and Google. Sales of $12.8 billion in the quarter compare with the average estimate of $13 billion, according to LSEG data. The company earlier this year began placing ads in its Prime Video offering for the first time.\nStill, Olsavsky said he was pleased with the advertising results. Those sales grew 20% in the quarter.

Want to level up your entertainment career?\u00a0Go here for more information.\nAmazon doubled its net income in the second quarter of 2024 to $13.5 billion, which it attributed largely to growth in its cloud-based Amazon Web Services (AWS). Net sales for its subscriptions services segment, which includes Prime Video, grew 10% to $10.87 billion in the quarter.\nHere are the top-line results:\nNet income:\u00a0$13.49 billion, up 99% from $6.7 billion a year ago.\nEarnings per share: $1.26 per share, compared to $1.05 expected by analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.\nRevenue: $148 billion, up from $134.4 billion last year, compared to $148.6 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.\nShares of Amazon, which reported its results after the bell on Thursday, climbed more than 7% in after-hours trading. As of Thursday\u2019s close, the Amazon\u2019s stock price was up 23% this year.\nCEO Andy Jassy noted Amazon\u2019s 11-year deal to secure the media rights for the NBA and WNBA, but most of Thursdays\u2019s earnings presentation focused on AWS and AI.\nNorth American segment sales for AWS were $90 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase. Sales for the international segment also increased by 7% over the same time period, clocking in at $31.7 billion. When accounting for changes in foreign exchange rates, the year-over-year increase was closer to 10%. Total segment sales for the period were a reported $26.3 billion, a 19% increase compared to Amazon\u2019s second quarter in 2023.\nAmazon\u2019s subscriptions segment also saw growth. That division includes annual and monthly fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships as well as digital video, audiobook, digital music, e-book and other non-AWS subscription services.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued re-acceleration in AWS growth,\u201d Andy Jassy, president and CEO of Amazon, said in the second quarter earnings letter.\nJassy said that AWS continues to be a \u201ctop choice\u201d as companies continue to modernize, move to the cloud and explore opportunities using Generative AI. He pointed to four AI tools as being beneficial to the growth of AWS: SageMaker, a cloud-based machine-learning platform that was designed for model builders; Bedrock, a tool that connects AWS users to foundation models from leading AI companies like Meta; Trainium, a machine-learning chip that is built for deep learning training and serves as a more affordable option for customers; and Q, Amazon\u2019s GenAI assistant for developers.\n\u201cThe reality right now is that, while we\u2019re investing a significant amount in the AI space and infrastructure, we would like to have more capacity than we already have. We have a lot of demand right now, and I think it\u2019s going to be very, very large business for us,\u201d Jassy said.\nAI has been a major factor during this round of earnings. Last week, Alphabet reported growth through Google\u2019s implementation of AI Overview, which provides its search users near-instant answers to their queries based on sources from around the web. This consumer-facing use of AI has increased engagement from users 18 to 24 years old. The company also announced it would be launching new ways to incorporate AI into search, including the introduction of a VR lenses and new features for Gmail and Google Photos.\nAs for Apple, the tech giant introduced Apple Intelligence last quarter. The upcoming personal intelligence system will put private generative AI models into the company\u2019s iPhone, iPad and Mac products.\nAmazon executives also mentioned Prime Video ads, which launched this year, as a sponsor product that is driving growth. At its launch in January, Prime Video estimated that its ads would reach 115 million monthly viewers in the U.S. This year also marked the first time Amazon attended the upfronts in New York, a series of presentations catered to potential advertisers.\nThe post Amazon Doubles Q2 Net Income to $13.49 Billion on Strength of Amazon Web Services appeared first on TheWrap.\n"

        "Text": "Dublin, Aug. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Saudi Arabia Ecommerce Market Report By Types (B2B Ecommerce, B2C Ecommerce) and Company Analysis 2024-2032\" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.The Saudi Arabia E-Commerce Market is forecast to reach US$ 41.59 Billion by 2032, up from US$ 11.79 Billion in 2023, with a CAGR of 15.04% between 2024 and 2032.Driving forces for Saudi Arabia's E-commerceRising Internet penetration:With nearly 100% of the population using the Internet, Saudi Arabia is a developed country with a high level of Internet penetration. This is according to data from the World Bank. This suggests that many people are aware of internet purchasing, which fuels market expansion. The increasing popularity of internet-based services can be attributed to the developments in broadband, smartphones, and mobile internet technologies. Additionally, as more people use the internet, e-commerce platforms can reach customers in remote locations where traditional retail infrastructure might not be as robust. Increased market growth and rivalry among e-commerce companies due to this broader access are pushing innovations in services, logistics, and customer experience.Government Initiatives:According to the analysis, the nation's increasing governmental support for using digital technologies by the Vision 2030 plan will accelerate market expansion throughout the projection period. For instance, the Ministry of Commerce in Saudi Arabia initiated ten projects in September 2022 to build e-stores. According to the ministry, ten initiatives were chosen to advance this sector based on recommendations from the general public.Rise in disposable income:The e-commerce market in Saudi Arabia is experiencing notable growth due to increased disposable income. The IMF reports that the nation has recorded a high per capita GDP, which is expected to continue growing, and a high individual net income. The nation's purchasing power may rise due to the per capita GDP growth, predicted to fuel demand for the clothing and fashion sectors. Higher disposable incomes also drive consumers to look for ease and variety when making purchases, which makes e-commerce platforms a desirable choice because of their affordability, wide selection of products, and competitive pricing.Homegrown e-commerce platforms boost the market: Homegrown e-commerce platforms are essential to the expansion of the e-commerce industry in Saudi Arabia since they are tailored to the country's tastes, demands, and legal restrictions. In addition to providing a large selection of products, websites like Noon, Souq (now Amazon. sa), and Jarir.com are aware of the particular cultural quirks and shopping habits of Saudi Arabia. In addition to supporting Arabic-language user interfaces and offering localized customer care, they also include payment choices like cash-on-delivery, which are popular with Saudi customers. These platforms also aid in economic diversification by generating jobs, assisting regional suppliers and logistics companies, and fostering innovation in digital technologies specifically suited for the Saudi market.Riyadh E-commerce MarketSeveral contemporary trends fuel the substantial expansion of the Riyadh e-commerce business. There has been a noticeable movement in favor of mobile commerce, or m-commerce, with many customers shopping via smartphones. This has made mobile-friendly platforms and apps necessary. Furthermore, e-commerce companies must improve their logistics capabilities and provide same-day or next-day delivery choices due to the growing demand for rapid and dependable delivery services.\nAdditionally, there's a noticeable shift toward customized shopping experiences and marketing strategies that make use of data analytics as well as artificial intelligence to understand consumer preferences better. Anticipating the future, augmented reality (A.R.) and virtual reality (V.R.) technologies are expected to be more integrated into the shopping process, improving customer interaction and product visualization.Saudi Arabia Ecommerce Company AnalysisThe top e-commerce companies in Saudi Arabia are Amazon., eBay., Emaar Properties Namshi, Noon, Alibaba, Jarir Marketing (Bookstore), and Carrefour.Key Topics Covered: 1.

The company says the new location could create more than 600 jobs for New Mexico residents.\nAmazon currently has one fulfillment center, one distribution center and a warehouse facility in Albuquerque, and a warehouse in Santa Fe.\n\"It's going to be a huge economic impact for not just Los Lunas, but Valencia County,\" said Victoria Archuleta, senior economic developer for the village of Los Lunas.\nAn added bonus, Archuleta said, is that some of the employees the facility already has brought on are transfers from Amazon's ABQ1 west-side fulfillment center in Albuquerque who live in Valencia County.\n\"So it's really great to see our workforce be able to live and work and stay and do all the things that they need here in Valencia County. And the more that we grow and get really notable employers like Amazon, Meta and some future employers to come, I think there's going to be so many more economic opportunities here for our residents,\" Archuleta said.\n"

        "Text": "Amazon Music announced Tuesday the launch of its new AI-powered feature, \u201cTopics,\u201d which allows users to explore podcast episodes by specific topics discussed in the episode.\nWhen you visit the page of a podcast episode, look for new Topic tags below the episode description. You can tap on a tag to see a list of related podcast episodes on the same topic. This allows you to find podcasts on specific topics like \"Coffee\" and \"Dopamine\" in addition to the usual categories like Comedy and News.\nThe company explained that the new feature is powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) but also relies on human labor. The AI analyzes podcast transcripts and descriptions to identify key topics, and then human team members determine the relevant tags to add to the episode page.\nThe feature is available for all Amazon Music users in the U.S. on iOS and Android devices, starting today. It\u2019ll roll out across top podcasts on Amazon Music, including The Daily, SmartLess, and This American Life, among others. The company also plans to expand the coverage of Topics to more podcast content, which will lead to a wider range of topics and an improved list of related podcast episodes.\nAnother AI-powered feature that Amazon Music is adding is Maestro, an AI playlist generator that creates playlists based on user prompts. The feature launched in beta this past April. The new AI features follow Amazon\u2019s acquisition of audio content discovery engine Snackable AI last year, which aimed to help enhance features for its podcasting venture.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/06/amazon-music-ai-feature-podcast-episodes-topics/\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 26, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\nSemiconductor and AI leader Nvidia reports earnings next Wednesday, August 28 after the market close and investors are waiting with bated breath. Nvidia's remarkable performance over the past two years is almost unfathomable, yet the company\u2019s expansion appears it should continue at this same rapid pace for years to come.\nHere, we will cover the path Nvidia has taken to get to its current position, what to expect from next week\u2019s earnings report and whether it\u2019s possible for Nvidia to reach a $10 Trillion market capitalization.\nThe results Nvidia has provided its shareholders with over the last 25 years is truly hard to understate. Over that period, the stock has compounded at an annual rate of 35.4%, yielding a dizzying 217,000% return. Even more recently, over just the last five years, NVDA stock has compounded at an annual rate of 98.5%, 30xing investor money over that time.\nAt the depths of the 2022 bear market, Nvidia had a market cap of $250 billion; today, it stands at a staggering $3 trillion. The meteoric rise is a direct result of Nvidia\u2019s strategic focus on AI infrastructure through its data center products. Since the pivot, annual sales have nearly quadrupled to $80 billion, and are expected to double again by 2026. Even more impressive is that Nvidia boasts 53% net margins on that revenue.\nFueled by surging demand for AI-driven solutions, Nvidia positioned itself at the heart of the AI revolution. Nvidia\u2019s focus on strategic partnerships with major cloud providers, its continued innovation in AI software (like the CUDA platform), and its ability to foresee the massive potential of generative AI were key to the stock\u2019s unprecedented rally.\nPartnering with fellow tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet has been the primary driver of its growth. Because Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet run massive cloud computing operations, and much AI development will occur in the cloud they have plowed tens of billion into Capex spending. While this is hugely beneficial to Nvidia, it is also good for all three major cloud providers. It\u2019s a symbiotic relationship as Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft add more power users to their platforms and Nvidia sells them the hardware.\nIf we look at the current quarter earnings forecasts, we can put into perspective the incredible pace that Nvidia continues to grow both the top and bottom line. Sales for the quarter are expected to grow 110% year over year (YoY) to $28.2 billion, while earnings are projected to climb 133% YoY to $0.63 per share. Looking further out, the expectations are equally impressive.\nAlthough Nvidia had sat atop the Zacks Rank for nearly two years, as analysts were continuously upgrading earnings estimates, today it has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, which most definitely isn\u2019t a negative thing. There is nothing bearish about a rank #3, just simply that earnings estimates haven\u2019t been upgraded recently.\nIt isn\u2019t just possible, it\u2019s likely Nvidia will reach a market cap of $10 trillion within the next five years based on current forecasts. Today, Nvidia has a one year forward earnings multiple of 48.9x, which is well below its five-year median of 55x. Incredibly, Nvidia has grown so fast that even though the stock price is up 20x in the last five years, it is still close to its cheapest relative valuation because of the incredible profit growth.\nTo get to the conclusion that Nvidia may be worth $10 trillion is of course quite speculative, however a simple extrapolation shows how it is not an unreasonable expectation. Earnings are forecast to grow 37.6% annually over the next three to five years, and if the stock grows at that pace while maintaining its current earnings multiple, it would be there in under five years.\nFor investors seeking exposure to AI and high-growth tech, Nvidia remains among the most compelling options. Despite the incredible run-up in its stock price, the company\u2019s leadership in AI infrastructure, strategic partnerships, and unmatched growth rates suggest that Nvidia could still have significant upside potential.\nAt its core, Nvidia is positioned to remain a key player in the AI revolution, with its GPUs powering the future of AI-driven industries. The company\u2019s focus on continuous innovation and its partnerships with major cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet provide a strong foundation for future growth.\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s valuation is relatively high, it is backed by extraordinary earnings growth that is expected to continue at a rapid pace. The company's potential to reach a $10 trillion market cap underscores its long-term growth trajectory, making it an attractive investment for those with a higher risk tolerance and a long-term perspective.\nIn conclusion, Nvidia's stock may be a buy for investors who believe in the future of AI and are willing to weather short-term market volatility in exchange for long-term gains. With its leadership in the AI space and strong earnings growth projections, Nvidia could continue to reward investors as it moves toward new milestones.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Text": "Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported its second quarter results. Although its financials showed AWS growth has\u00a0reaccelerated, this piece of good news was overshadowed by\u00a0increased capital spending that pressured margins. Amazon has joined Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) in their AI spending spree.\nFor the quarter ended on June 30th, Amazon reported revenue grew 10% YoY to\u00a0$148.0\u00a0billion, which came short of LSEG\u2019s\u00a0$148.56 billion\u00a0consensus estimate.\nBy inserting ads into Prime Video, Amazon fueled its advertising revenue that went up as much as 20% to $12.77 billion, but this was still short of StreetAccount\u2019s consensus estimate of $13 billion. This is a slowdown compared to the previous quarter when Amazon recorded YoY growth of 24%.\u00a0Undoubtedly, advertising is Amazon\u2019s fastest-growing revenue stream. It is also one of its highest-margin businesses.\nAmazon touted the growth of its core profit driving segment, AWS, whose sales surged 19% to $26.28 billion, with operating income of $9.3 billion\u00a0greatly exceeding that of last year\u2019s comparable quarter when it amounted to $5.4 billion. AWS growth accelerated from previous quarter\u2019s 17% while Microsoft reported its cloud computing unit, Azure, slowed from 31% reported in the previous quarter to 29%. Although Amazon has not revealed the exact contribution of generative AI to AWS\u2019s top line, it did state back in May that the developing technology has grown into a multi-billiion dollar revenue run-rate business. But, the segment\u2019s margins shrinked by 2 percentage points to 36%, as they were squeezed by investments in property and equipment that rose 50% to $17.6 billion. After pulling back after the pandemic, Amazon went back to increasing its capital spending.\nNet income doubled to $13.5 billion,\u00a0$1.26 per diluted share, topping analyst estimates for EPS of $1.03 and for net income of $11 billion.\nAmazon guided for current quarter sales to range between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, which translates to year-over-year growth between 8% and 11%. Operating income outlook is in the range between $11.5 billion and $15.0 billion, which is a further signal that the AI spending spree threatens to eat into profits.\nThe need for evidence to justify\u00a0the AI spending spree.\nLike its tech peers, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet, Amazon needs to prove its hefty AI investments are worth the immense cost. Earlier this week, Microsoft also revealed a surge in capital spending for the sake of building its AI infrastructure. Covering all cloud and AI-related spending, Microsoft revealed its capital expenditure surged almost 80% YoY to $19 billion. As for the 2024 fiscal year, Microsft reported full year capital expenditure of $55.7 billion, adding that it will continue to rise next year.\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  JOHN COX, The Bakersfield Californian ",
        "Text": "A $20 million \"last mile\" distribution center that sat empty on Wilson Road for two years after it was built finally opened last week, creating about 250 jobs and improving delivery service for local Amazon customers.\nThe 128,000-square-foot facility just west of Highway 99 is not expected to operate at full capacity until close to the holiday season, but it is officially running with dozens of Amazon and Budget rental delivery vans ready to go.\nAmazon now has three working distribution centers in Kern, including a 2.6 million-square-foot \"fulfillment\" center in Oildale across Merle Haggard Drive from Meadows Field Airport and a facility less than half that size designed for soft goods in Shafter. A fourth measuring 653,442 square feet was approved in late June by the county Board of Supervisors for construction just south of Bakersfield near Houghton and Wible roads.\nThe one on Wilson, at a former Kmart and Big Lots shopping center, is the smallest of the four, designed to take in six truckloads of consumer goods per day then sort and home-deliver them.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to continue investing in Bakersfield with the opening of our newest delivery station, bringing more great jobs with comprehensive benefits that start on day one to the region,\" Amazon spokesperson Natalie Banke said in an email statement Tuesday.\nAmazon put the brakes on the facility in summer 2022 just as construction finished. A subsequent report said the delay was part of a move by the company to cancel, delay or close 49 last-mile processing centers nationwide, for a total of 50.2 million square feet of warehouse space. The decision to do so was made just months after Amazon reported its slowest sales growth in decades.\nBanke reported Tuesday the new center will create more than 100 direct jobs with Amazon and more than 150 additional positions through what it called a delivery service provider. The program invites local entrepreneurs to build their own logistics business delivering packages for Amazon.\n\"We look forward to better serving our customers across Kern County with faster, more efficient deliveries as the station continues to ramp up,\u201d she stated.\n"

        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.23 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.63 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 17.14%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online retailer would post earnings of $0.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.13, delivering a surprise of 36.14%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\nAmazon , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $147.98 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.44%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $134.38 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nAmazon shares have added about 23.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 15.8%.\nWhile Amazon has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Amazon: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.19 on $158.17 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.59 on $638.21 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Commerce is currently in the top 21% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\nOne other stock from the same industry, Solo Brands, Inc. (DTC), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 7.\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -45.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\nSolo Brands, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $128.5 million, down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "SALTILLO - The details are scarce for now, but Amazon has announced plans to open a \"last mile\" facility in Saltillo's Turner Industrial Park.\nPlans for the 96,000 square-foot delivery station announced Monday are in the very early stages, with renovations to an existing on-site spec building scheduled to begin in the coming weeks, the company said.\n\u201cThis last mile facility will allow us to better serve customers in Lee County and the surrounding area,\u201d said Jessica Breaux, senior manager of economic development for Amazon. \u201cWe\u2019re grateful for our partnership with the Community Development Foundation and Lee County. We look forward to sharing more details about this facility in the future.\u201d\nThe company said the new last mile facility will help \"power the last mile of Amazon\u2019s fulfillment process by enabling fast, everyday delivery directly to customers\u2019 doorstep.\" Packages are transported to delivery stations from Amazon fulfillment and sortation centers, and then employees process customer packages for last mile delivery. Most employees in customer fulfillment and transportation earn between $17 and $28 per hour.\nAmazon will utilize a spec building already in place at Turner Industrial Park, and will make renovations to it to meet its needs.\n\u201cCDF began investing in the construction of speculative shell buildings several years ago for the purpose of recruiting new companies to our community,\u201d said CDF Board Chair Charlie Kinney. \u201cThis investment is paying great dividends now as a global brand such as Amazon has decided to locate here into one of our buildings.\u201d\nHow many jobs the Saltillo facility will provide, and the investment Amazon will make, is unknown.\nBut the company has made several similar announcements in recent months. A 65,000-square-foot last mile facility in Jackson, Tennessee, was announced in March, as was a facility in Burlington, Iowa. In Rapho Township, Pennsylvania, a facility opened in March with 150 direct and indirect jobs. In May, a facility was announced for Yakima, Washington, and Fallon, Nevada.\nA $20 million facility in Bakersfield, California, opened last week with 250 jobs.\n\u201cWe are excited to welcome Amazon to Lee County,\u201d said Wesley Webb, president of the Lee County Board of Supervisors. \u201cAmazon\u2019s presence in our community will help attract other major brands to locate here. This will also increase their service capacity to the region. We want to especially thank our partners at Tennessee Valley Authority and Appalachian Regional Commission for helping us and assisting with product development for our recruitment of companies.\u201d\nSince 2010, Amazon has created more than 6,000 full- and part-time jobs in Mississippi and has invested more than $3.5 billion across the state. That number includes both investment in infrastructure and compensation to employees. These investments have contributed an additional $3.2 billion to the Mississippi economy and have helped create more than 11,700 indirect jobs on top of Amazon\u2019s direct hires \u2014 from jobs in construction and logistics to professional services.\nIn addition, more than 1,500 independent sellers \u2014 most of which are small and medium-sized businesses \u2014 in Mississippi are selling to customers in Amazon\u2019s store, creating thousands of additional jobs across the state.\n"

        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Amazon.com Inc's (NASDAQ:AMZN) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-08-05, Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $87.98. It's currently trading at a price of $167.83. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -90.76%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$3.64\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.74%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n22.38\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n10.45\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n87.98\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $59.54. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -181.88%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods,\u00a0please click here>>>\nHere are the key points:\nThe overall picture that has emerged out of the Q2 earnings season is one of stability and an improving earnings outlook, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality. That said, estimates for the current period have started to weaken faster than we saw in the last two periods.\nFor the 431 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, or 86.2% of the index\u2019s total membership, total earnings are up +10.6% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 79.8% beating EPS estimates and 59.2% beating revenue estimates.\nFor 2024 Q3, total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +4.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway, with the current +4.7% earnings growth pace down from +6.9% in early July.\nQ2 earnings for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 companies are expected to be up +33.5% from the same period last year on +14.3% higher revenues. Excluding the \u2018Mag 7\u2019, Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +6.2% (from +11.0%).\nThe \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 stocks - Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA \u2013 have been in the spotlight in the ongoing market turmoil. This followed these companies\u2019 Q2 quarterly releases that mostly failed to impress market participants, particularly the reports from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla.\nAs we noted in this space recently, the market\u2019s issue with the Mag 7 companies\u2019 quarterly reports wasn\u2019t so much their current earnings or outlooks for the coming periods but rather with their ever-rising capex levels that are going towards AI projects. Market participants would like to see a clearer monetization path for these AI investments, but management teams have generally been unable to provide that level of visibility.\nWe don\u2019t see elevated capex by Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, or any other Tech operator as an issue. After all, these investments will ensure that these companies remain at the cutting edge of this evolving new business opportunity.\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, we now have Q2 earnings from all but Nvidia, which is scheduled to report on August 28th. For the group as a whole, combining the actual results from the six companies that have reported already with estimates for Nvidia, total Q2 earnings are on track to be up +33.5% on +14.3% higher revenues.\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +20.6% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.5%, followed by another strong showing expected next year. A big contributing factor to the Tech sector\u2019s positive earnings outlook is the sector\u2019s margins outlook.\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year\u2019s record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector\u2019s productivity.\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway.\nThis is a bigger decline to estimates relative to the comparable periods for the two preceding quarters. The negative revisions trend is widespread and not concentrated in one or two sectors, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut over this period. The Tech and Finance sectors are the only ones enjoying positive estimate revisions over this period.\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +8.4% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +8.1%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.2%. In other words, about half of this year\u2019s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "SHELTON, Conn., August 15, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Telliris, a leading provider of IVR solutions for workforce management and time & attendance announced it has executed testing of Telliris Attend version 2.9.0 on AWS EC2 for a six-month period.\nProvisioning of Telliris Attend on AWS is a natural progression of operating in a virtual environment. Due to the real-time nature of telecommunications processing it was not possible to run in a virtualized environment in the early days of IVR. Telliris first announced support of a virtualized environment in 2014 with VMWare vSphere Hypervisor ESXi 5.1 In 2022 Telliris transitioned its cloud environment from carrier neutral data centers to the Google Cloud Platform.\nTelliris is available in both Cloud SaaS as well as On-Premises formats. This is due to it serving a telecommunications role where on-premises format is sometimes more favorable, keeping traffic within an organizations private network.\nTelliris is built from the top down to operate for long periods of time with near zero administration. The testing in AWS for six months demonstrated stable operation including continuous connectivity with a partner time & attendance system located at one of the other four major public cloud providers. The positive results were in accord with this overall strategy.\nFrom an operational perspective there are no changes when running Telliris in AWS, GCP, VMWare, or Bare Metal environments. Organizations that prefer running in AWS can stand up an instance of Telliris in a couple hours. The procedure is similar to provisioning in other public cloud environments. Partners and their end-customers can use the Telliris AWS Provisioning Guide even if they do not have AWS knowledge and expertise such as for setting up a reference platform for use by support staff. Telliris employs a \"one step install process\" which takes a new server / VM / Public Cloud Instance and loads all software in 10 to 15 minutes so it is ready to accept inbound calls. The one step install along with the AWS guide make it a routine process which is greatly appreciated by the Telliris channel partner community. Telliris products are sold, installed, and maintained by channel partners that provide it alongside their workforce management, human capital management, and time and attendance products.\n\"Telliris recognized a strong desire for Virtualization and Public Cloud support by its channel partners and their end-customers years ago,\" said Mark Nickson, Managing Director at Telliris. With the addition of AWS, HR and IT departments have another virtualization solution.\nAbout Telliris\nTelliris, a division of DAC Systems focuses specifically on making IVR Time and Labor Data Collection solutions. Telliris Attend is available through the companies it has partnered with in the Time & Attendance, Workforce Management and Human Capital Management industries.

Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway, with the current +4.3% earnings growth pace down from +6.9% in early July.\nThe Q3 negative revisions trend is far bigger than what we had seen in the comparable periods of the preceding two quarters. Estimates have come down for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines in the Energy, Medical, Transportation, and Business Services sectors. Estimates for the Tech and Finance sectors have gone up.\nThe 'Magnificent 7' stocks - Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA \u2013 were in the spotlight in the recent market turmoil. This followed these companies' Q2 quarterly releases that mostly failed to impress market participants, particularly the reports from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla.\nAs we noted in this space recently, the market's issue with the Mag 7 companies' quarterly reports wasn't so much their current earnings or outlooks for the coming periods but rather with their ever-rising capex levels that are going towards AI projects. Market participants would like to see a clearer monetization path for these AI investments, but management teams have generally been unable to provide that level of visibility.\nWe don't see elevated capex by Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, or any other Tech operator as an issue. After all, these investments will ensure that these companies remain at the cutting edge of this evolving new business opportunity.\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, we now have Q2 earnings from all but Nvidia, which is scheduled to report on August 28th. For the group as a whole, combining the actual results from the six companies that have reported already with estimates for Nvidia, total Q2 earnings are on track to be up +33.4% on +14.3% higher revenues.\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +20.6% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.6%, followed by another strong showing expected next year.\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year's record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector's productivity.\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues. Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway.\nThis is a bigger decline to estimates relative to the comparable periods for the two preceding quarters. The negative revisions trend is widespread and not concentrated in one or two sectors, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut over this period. The Tech and Finance sectors are the only ones enjoying positive estimate revisions over this period.\nPlease note that this year's +8.1% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +7.8%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.2%. In other words, about half of this year's earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.
