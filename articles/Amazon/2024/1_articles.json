        "Author": " Alexandra Canal    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) is\u00a0expected to start rolling out ads on its Prime Video streaming service beginning Monday in the US \u2014 and Wall Street is bullish on the tech behemoth massively disrupting the shifting media market.\nPrime Video subscriptions will now automatically default to the ad-supported tier at current monthly rates of $14.99 for Prime delivery members and $8.99 for non-Prime members, or those who only subscribe to the standalone video service. Subscribers who want the ad-free version will now see their monthly bill go up by $3 a month.\n\"A 500 lb. gorilla enters the room,\" MoffettNathanson lead analyst Michael Morton wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"We strongly believe that Amazon\u2019s decision to add advertising to Prime Video will be a disruptive force to commoditized advertising video on demand (AVOD) players, siloed connected TV (CTV) platforms and non-top 20 linear cable networks.\"\nAmazon has roughly 96 million US Prime households, but only a subset of that actively engages with Prime Video, according to MoffettNathanson. The firm estimates Prime Video, which streams shows like \"Reacher\" and \"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,\" has an active US subscriber base that's roughly equivalent to Netflix\u2019s 70 million.\nAs a result of the new rollout, the firm anticipates video ad revenue of $1.3 billion in 2024\u00a0and $2.3 billion in 2025. Subscription revenue should also go up by $500 million annually for those who opt to pay extra for the premium tier.\n\"We forecast Amazon and Disney being neck-and-neck for largest drivers of AVOD ad-revenue,\" the analysts wrote, predicting the US connected TV and ad-supported market will hit $16 billion by 2025.\nAmazon is expected to lead the pack at $4 billion, with Hulu close behind at $3 billion. Peacock (CMCSA) and Roku (ROKU) round out the top four at $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.\nFollowing its US debut, the ad tier will roll out globally in the UK and Germany on Feb. 5 before dropping in France, Italy, Spain, Mexico, and Australia later this year. Amazon said it plans to have \"meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers.\"\nAccording to Adweek, ad buyers will pay a cost-per-thousand, or CPM rate, between $30 to $35. That's lower than what they pay to advertise on competitor platforms, which analysts say could lead to downward pressure on pricing.\nTo compare, Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS) were reportedly seeking a CPM rate between $50 and $60 for their respective ad tiers. Pushback from advertisers eventually convinced them to lower their asking price.\nIn addition to pricing, Amazon's decision to default users to the ad-supported tier also differs from competitors, although it was considered by one streaming giant.\n\"We did consider making [ads] the default option,\" Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said on Wednesday's earnings call. \"But given our long history of not having ads, we thought it was better for our members rather than force them into a change and give them ads.\"\nPeters added he's not concerned when it comes to Amazon entering the ad-supported arena, telling investors there's plenty of ad inventory to go around.\n\"We talked about over $25 billion in [connected TV] ad spend alone, so there's room for multiple players,\" he said, noting the streamer will compete by \"playing to its strengths\" like viewership engagement.\nStill, the move is widely expected to massively transform the industry.\n\"Amazon has one of the broadest audience reaches of all the streaming services,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen told Yahoo Finance. \"They have the reach, they have the consumer data. There will likely be an acceleration toward retail media spending, which could encourage everybody else to do more shop-able advertising.\"\n\"It just raises the stakes,\" the analyst continued. \"Everybody now faces another competitor and a very large supply of inventory that they're going to be competing for. It'll drive more demand, or better tools to get better pricing on ads through better targeting or better use of programmatic advertising.\"\nNollen added Amazon's entrance will also encourage a substantial shift of ad buyers from linear to streaming \u2014 yet another blow to legacy media as the cable bundle continues to deteriorate.\n\"Among media companies, the entire media sector would appear to be at risk with the greatest pain at Paramount (PARA) and AMC Networks (AMCX) given their lack of diversified profitability away from linear networks and limited exposure to live cable network content,\" MoffettNathanson wrote in its report.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  Demitri Kalogeropoulos, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) shareholders had a fantastic 2023 as their stock gained 80% on the year, easily beating the 24% rally in the S&P 500 and the 43% spike in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index. That performance wasn't quite good enough to put the e-commerce giant's shares back into record territory, although it did push its valuation back above $1.5 trillion. Amazon stock remains below the all-time highs of over $180 per share that were set when the market was soaring in late 2021.\nThe 2023 rally was powered by several encouraging trends that imply much higher annual earnings ahead for this massive business.\nAmazon posted accelerating sales trends throughout the year, giving investors one big reason to like the stock. Sales were up 13% in the most recent quarter compared to an 11% increase in fiscal Q2 and a 9% uptick in Q1. Wall Street loves to see speeding revenue gains, especially in a business that books over $500 billion of sales each year.\nPart of that rebound came from a return to growth in the e-commerce division following a painful post-pandemic slowdown through most of 2022. But investors were even happier to see Amazon's services segment expand more quickly. That division, anchored by the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, grew at a blazing 18% rate last quarter and now accounts for well over 50% of the total business. That's great news because a continued shift toward service sales likely means higher profitability over time.\nAmazon also showed solid progress in its pivot toward more balance between growth and profits. Operating cash flow soared over the last few quarters and is in solidly positive territory after declining in 2022. Earnings are on a much stronger trajectory, too.\nThe 2023 rally means the odds are stacked against Amazon repeating its market-thumping performance this year. Yet growth stock investors shouldn't ignore that possibility. If its operating and financial momentum carries through into 2024, operating profit margin could keep moving toward the double digits. Success here would mean much higher profits, and positive shareholder returns, over the long term.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the top e-commerce company in the world. Its Prime Day and Black Friday sales often serve as indicators for how well the global economy is doing. Moreover, it's been a fantastic growth stock. A $20,000 investment in it 20 years ago would be worth more than $1.1 million today.\nBut as well as it has performed over the long haul, it has slowed down in recent years. There's another stock, also involved in e-commerce and tech, that has been an even better buy of late, and that's Shopify (NYSE: SHOP).\nShopify went public in 2015 and has been red-hot ever since. Aside from 2022, when the markets as a whole struggled, Shopify has delivered consistently positive returns since 2016 (its first full year on the market). And it has also done better than Amazon in almost every one of those years.\nWhat has made Shopify successful is its ability to help anyone become an online vendor quickly and easily. For a recurring fee, it will help any business set up and manage an online shop to sell its goods and services all over the world. And there is no need to go onto a different platform, such as Amazon, to sell those items. Merchants can do so right on their own websites. \nThe ease of use and attractiveness of Shopify's services have enabled it to be a big player in e-commerce. And a big reason for the stock's superior returns over Amazon in recent years is that its growth rate has also been significantly higher.\nAMZN revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months.\nThe advantages Shopify has are that as a smaller company, it takes much less growth in absolute terms to provide it with faster growth on a percentage basis, and it has more room to expand its footprint, especially in a massive industry such as e-commerce. Its revenue over the past four quarters totaled $6.7 billion, while Amazon generated more than $554 billion in sales during the same period.\nInvestors' hopes that Shopify will become the \"next Amazon\" are likely a key reason why the stock has performed so well and been such a hot buy. But even today, its market capitalization is just under $100 billion -- nowhere near the $1.5 trillion market cap of Amazon.\nBoth Shopify and Amazon are attractive growth stock options for investors to consider for the long haul, and it would be hard to go wrong with either one for your portfolio, especially as the global economy grows.\nBut I do believe that Shopify can continue to outperform Amazon. Over the years, Amazon has been diversifying into industries like healthcare and video streaming in an effort to expand its growth opportunities. But I think by focusing primarily on e-commerce, Shopify could produce better results in the long run.\nIf you want to buy only one of these stellar e-commerce stocks, then buy Shopify. But there would be nothing wrong with investing in both.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock in 2024",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is up 66% over the last 12 months after a stellar growth year. Cost-cutting measures and investment in lucrative sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) have put the company on a promising trajectory that could offer major gains over the long term.\n2023 was a year of recovery for Amazon, as it brought its e-commerce business back to profitability and expanded its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The tech firm's earnings and free cash flow soared, putting it on a solid financial footing for 2024.\nWith lower costs and growth catalysts throughout tech, the company could be in for another impressive year that you won't want to miss out on. So here are three reasons to buy Amazon stock in 2024.\nMacroeconomic headwinds throughout 2022 brought down the entire tech market and led the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector to plunge 40% throughout the year. Amazon was not unscathed, with its stock falling 50% during the period alongside steep earnings declines.\nHowever, a market downturn can sometimes be the best test of a company's worth as a long-term investment. And Amazon's performance under pressure has proven it's one of the most reliable stocks.\nAfter repeated hits to its business in 2022, Amazon got to work restructuring its operations, with a priority on profits. Cost-cutting moves like closing dozens of warehouses, thousands of layoffs, and shuttering unprofitable projects like its telehealth platform Amazon Care have been instrumental to the company's recovery.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, Amazon posted revenue growth of 13% year over year, beating Wall Street forecasts by $1.5 billion, while operating income more than tripled. Much of the tech giant's growth came from its e-commerce business. Its North American segment posted more than $4 billion in operating income, significantly improving on the $412 million in losses it posted in the year-ago quarter.\nMoreover, Amazon's restructuring has seen its free cash flow skyrocket 427% over the last year to $17 billion. The company is in the best financial health it's been in years, with the funds to keep investing in its business and overcome potential headwinds.\nAmazon is best known for the popularity of its online retail site, which accounts for more than 80% of its revenue. However, the company's biggest growth driver has quickly become AWS. The cloud platform earned 60% of Amazon's $11 billion in operating income in Q3 2023.\nThe cloud market has exploded in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic boosted the sector, as countless businesses moved operations online and adopted hybrid working styles. Meanwhile, cloud computing looks likely to become one of the most lucrative areas of AI. Companies are increasingly seeking ways to boost productivity with the help of AI and turning to cloud services to do so.\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030, which would see it exceed a value of $1 trillion. With its leading 32% market share in the cloud sector, AWS is well positioned to reap major benefits from AI.\nOver the last year, AWS has added a diverse range of AI tools and announced a coming venture into chip production. Alongside significant financial resources and brand power, Amazon could become one of the biggest threats in AI -- if it isn't already.\nDespite last year's bull run, Amazon's stock remains down about 17% from a high it hit in July 2021. The figure could mean the company's shares have plenty of room left to run in the new year. Meanwhile, EPS estimates are even more optimistic.\nThis chart shows Amazon's earnings could reach nearly $5 per share by fiscal 2024. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 44 yields a stock price of $211, projecting stock growth of 36% over the next fiscal year.\nAlongside recent cost-cutting measures and a highly profitable cloud business, Amazon stock is a no-brainer in 2024.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been among the best-performing stocks you could own for a long time. If you'd invested $10,000 in Amazon two decades ago, it would now be worth over $571,000. However, that return used to be higher, as Amazon hasn't set a new all-time high since 2021.\nBut with how things are shaping up, Amazon could be set to notch a new all-time high in 2024. That could make it the biggest year in history for Amazon, and I think it's a wise idea to buy the stock now in preparation.\nAmazon is far more than the e-commerce business that everyone knows. While Amazon used to be primarily a buyer and seller of goods, it's become more of a service-oriented business now, which is good for investors.\nWhile its online stores still make up about 45% of total sales, it's growing at a slow 7% pace. One of its fastest-growing segments, third-party seller services, grew at a 20% pace and made up 27% of revenue. That's a critical transition, as Amazon is now selling its platform to other commerce companies to do business on while handling their payment transactions and delivery. This is a far more profitable avenue, as Amazon doesn't have to worry about finding the latest product or maintaining inventory, which falls on the seller's shoulders.\nAmazon is also benefiting by selling more Amazon Prime subscriptions, up 14% in Q3, and it has a booming ad services division, up 26% in the same quarter. Although Amazon doesn't break out the profitability of each segment directly, we can use companies focused on subscription and advertising to deduce that these businesses are far more profitable than commerce.\nThe rise of these divisions is already having a huge effect on Amazon's gross profit margin.\nWith these higher-margin businesses growing faster than their lower-margin ones, Amazon's gross profit has steadily risen to new all-time highs. This trend shows no signs of slowing in 2024, leading to new records.\nThe higher gross margin will also lead to improved profit.\nWhen founder Jeff Bezos was at the head of Amazon, he was always focused on the next biggest growth driver and on how big Amazon could get. Profit came second to growth, which hurt the company in 2022.\nHowever, when Andy Jassy took over the CEO role, he began to focus on profit alongside growth, something that was crucial for Amazon's business maturity. While it took some time to work through Bezos' decisions, like excess warehouses and staff, the effects are now being felt.\nIn Q3, Amazon's operating profit margin approached levels set in 2021, when the stay-at-home boost from COVID was in full effect.\nWith sustainable changes in place, Amazon will probably deliver at least 8% operating margin throughout 2024. That's something investors have never seen with Amazon and would make it a massive year for the company.\nIf Amazon grows its revenue by 11% to $572 billion in 2024, as Wall Street analysts project, and maintains an 8% operating profit margin, that would give Amazon a profit of $41.2 billion, assuming a 10% tax rate. That would value Amazon at 38 times 2024 earnings, which is still expensive.\nBut if Amazon can squeak out a few more points on its margin, up to 10%, that valuation falls to 30 times 2024 earnings.\nThis could be Amazon's biggest year, thanks to an improving margin. However, this trend won't be wrapped up in 2024; it's expected to continue for several years. If Amazon stays on this path, it will continue to be one of the best investments in the market.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock lost ground in Thursday's trading. The e-commerce and cloud computing giant's share price closed out the daily session down 2.6%, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nAmazon stock pulled back today following a report from Bloomberg that TikTok is planning on entering the e-commerce market. Wall Street is showing some concern that an innovative competitor could pressure the reigning online retail giant.\nTikTok, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has a massive and highly engaged global user base -- and it could make waves in industries outside of its core social-media operations. Exactly what tack ByteDance and TikTok might take to enter and expand in the e-commerce market remains to be seen.\nBuilding out a warehousing and distribution network would be difficult and costly. Building infrastructure that could rival Amazon's would be even more challenging. TikTok could accelerate its entry into the market with acquisitions or partnerships, but it's far too early to suggest that it's poised to disrupt Amazon in the category.\nEven with indications that TikTok could enter the e-commerce market, Amazon still looks like a smart buy for 2024.\nWhile Amazon generates the large majority of its revenue from its e-commerce business, it actually generates the large majority of its profits from its cloud infrastructure business. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is facing increasing competition from companies including Microsoft and Alphabet, but it remains top dog in the cloud market.\nCrucially, the space continues to grow and is big enough to support multiple winners, and Amazon is poised to score ongoing wins as the cloud services industry continues to expand. With new artificial intelligence applications being developed, launched, and scaled on the company's cloud infrastructure, AWS stands to enjoy strong demand tailwinds through the next decade and beyond.\nAdditionally, the company's e-commerce business could benefit from AI trends. With computing breakthroughs opening the door for increased factory and delivery automation, Amazon could see margins for its online retail business improve significantly.\nAmazon remains one of the world's best-run companies, and it has an excellent track record when it comes to innovating and fending off competitors.

        "Author": " Hamza Shaban    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "The COVID-era spending spree is over. And the tech layoffs keep coming.\nAmazon (AMZN) is eliminating several hundred roles across Prime Video and MGM Studios, according to a memo sent to staff on Wednesday. And the company's video game livestreaming platform, Twitch, announced it is laying off more than 500 people.\nThat Amazon is ringing in the new year with another round of cuts highlights the tech sector's climb down from COVID-era expansion. Even as confidence grows on Wall Street that the economy will finally break free from fears of a recession, tech companies are still reeling from heady staffing days and ambitious investments made during the early stages of the pandemic.\nDuring the acute phase of the public health crisis, company ranks swelled alongside aspirations of rapid growth and a tech-centric transformation. Many executives and market observers believed new consumer habits would redefine the trends to come and accelerate changes already on the way. Screen time exploded as social lives shrunk and adapted. But the spike in demand for e-commerce and digital services eventually leveled off, leaving executives with what they claimed were bloated teams and inefficiency. A brutal wave of job cuts was their answer.\n\"A lot of companies in various sectors of the economy had rapid expansion during the 'stay at home economy,'\" said Clark Bellin, president and chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth. \"Amazon is taking steps to narrow the gap between employee headcount and the growth of its business.\"\nAmazon was arguably the darling of the pandemic era as it benefited from consumers\u2019 sudden shift to online shopping and businesses\u2019 broad move to the cloud, said Nicole Tanenbaum, partner and chief investment strategist at Chequers Financial Management. During this period, Amazon\u2019s profitability soared while the company boosted staffing and leaned into expanded offerings and markets. Amazon\u2019s headcount grew by 310,000 from 2020 to 2021, an increase of almost 25%.\nBut as the disruptions of the pandemic eased into a recovering economy,\u00a0the company\u2019s prior investment decisions collided with slowing revenue growth, a reset in consumer spending patterns, and increasing cost pressures triggered by historic inflation.\nAmazon also faced a major leadership transition. Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s founder, whose identity is intimately tied to the company, stepped aside as CEO in 2021. Andy Jassy, the head of Amazon\u2019s lucrative and industry-leading cloud service, AWS, then took the reins.\n\u201cNot only does Jassy take a much more direct approach with regards to regulatory and political issues, he has not been afraid to admit that the company overbuilt and needed to reset its approach, lasering in on efforts to control margins and operations in the face of significant inflationary pressures,\u201d Tanenbaum said.\nFor Jassy and Amazon, rightsizing the business arrived in the form of substantial cost-cutting initiatives. The company enacted stark headcount reductions along with a hiring freeze to further control costs.\nAmazon's layoffs over the last several years amount to more than 27,000 cuts. The latest round underscores the financial pullback, especially in contrast to massive spending during peak COVID. For instance,\u00a0Amazon spent $8.5 billion to acquire MGM, the home of James Bond, in 2022. And the company is estimated to have doled out more than $1 billion to produce multiple seasons of The Rings of Power, its Lord of the Rings prequel series, and likely the most expensive show ever.\nWhile Amazon is among the largest private employers in the US, and the biggest within the tech world, several of its industry peers have turned to drastic layoffs. Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, dubbed 2023 the \"year of efficiency.\" The social media company cut more than 20,000 jobs since late 2022 to cope with declining ad revenue and to improve the business and its cost structure.\nAnd Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which has cut more than 10,000 jobs in that period, said on Thursday it is laying off hundreds of workers on its digital assistant, hardware, and engineering teams, as the search giant aims to trim costs and focus on its biggest priorities.\nThere is a chance Big Tech will bolster its ranks if the Fed starts to cut rates later this year, relaxing the more reserved posture the industry has adopted. But what\u2019s happening now to staff levels suggests otherwise, said Cory Stahle, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. After peaking in the spring of 2022, tech industry headcounts suffered a significant decline through the summer of last year. Those losses eventually flattened out and leveled off, a trend that\u2019s likely to continue, as exuberance gives way to caution.\nThe digital lives of consumers changed during the pandemic \u2014 that's undeniable. But they continue to change, along with the next chapter of the US economy.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock soared approximately 75% in 2023, around triple the total returns of the S&P 500 index. After a rough 2022, the stock made a huge turnaround as the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant finally saw some margin expansion and generated positive free cash flow again. It now sits at a market capitalization of over $1.5 trillion and is the fifth-most valuable company in the world.\nWith the stock up by so much, you might be under the impression you've missed the boat with Amazon stock. But just because a stock is up a lot doesn't mean you should avoid buying shares. Is Amazon set to beat the market yet again in 2024? Let's take a closer look to find out.\nAmazon has its fingers in a lot of pies. For example, it is currently investing heavily in healthcare and satellite internet services. But today, two segments drive this entire operation: e-commerce and cloud computing.\nPeople have been skeptical about Amazon's e-commerce segment for years, claiming it will always struggle to generate a profit due to the sky-high costs associated with building a vertically integrated online shopping platform. This is especially true in the United States due to how spread out the population is geographically.\nIn late 2023, the company showed that these concerns are misguided. Due to the scale of its logistics footprint, booming advertising revenue, and more sales coming in from high-margin, third-party seller fees, Amazon's e-commerce segment is showing margin expansion.\u00a0At least, it is in North America.\nLast quarter, Amazon's North American segment had a 4.9% operating margin, up from negative 0.5% a year prior. With $340 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, a 5% operating margin equals $17 billion in operating income from this segment.\nThere's no reason to think this margin expansion won't continue. Amazon is still working through the huge capacity build-out that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic and is seeing strong growth from advertising and third-party sales. With how high-margin these revenue streams are, it would be unsurprising to see Amazon's North American segment reach 10% operating margins at some point in 2024. That is $34 billion in earnings just from its North American retail operations.\nOnline shopping is set to continue gaining market share this decade and still makes up just 20% of overall retail sales. That means Amazon -- after all these years -- still has an industry tailwind at its back that should keep revenue compounding to higher levels over the next few years.\nAmazon's most profitable segment is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing division. Closing in on $100 billion of revenue with greater than 25% operating margins, this would be one of the world's most profitable businesses on its own.\nInvestors have been worried about slowing revenue growth at AWS, with sales up just 12% year over year last quarter. This feels short-sighted. AWS has felt the slowdown in venture capital funding and the software sector, as it is the computing backbone for many of these companies. It even explicitly started working with struggling clients to reduce their cloud computing bills, which slowed revenue growth.\nDespite these headwinds, the segment is still growing revenue by 12% year over year. With cloud computing continuing to take market share from legacy computing solutions, the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, and the general growth of computing needs worldwide, AWS looks poised to grow revenue at a double-digit rate for the foreseeable future.\nIf AWS reaches $200 billion in revenue within five to six years, which seems doable as long as it can maintain market share, the segment could be doing over $50 billion in operating income for Amazon. That would be quite the profit machine.\nThe short answer? Yes. At least it is if you have a multiyear time horizon. Amazon trades at a market cap of $1.56 trillion and has a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 78, which makes the stock seem expensive in a vacuum. However, anyone just looking at the trailing P/E is failing to appreciate the rapid margin expansion within e-commerce and the massive growth potential remaining in the cloud computing division.\nIf we assume its North American retail division can hit 10% margins and $34 billion in earnings, and cloud computing will hit $25 billion in earnings shortly, that is $59 billion in combined earnings for Amazon. It also assigns zero value for its international retail operations and any of its moonshot bets, such as Kuiper satellite internet or healthcare. Dividing $1.56 trillion by $59 billion equals a P/E of 26, almost exactly the market average and much more palatable than a P/E of 78.\nRemember that Amazon still has plenty of runway left to grow its top line and that this also puts zero value on any other subsidiaries besides AWS and North American retail. With this in mind, I think Amazon stock remains cheap and has a good chance of beating the market again in 2024.

        "Title": "Amazon launches health monitoring program, partners with Omada Health",
        "Author": " Anjalee Khemlani    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) is partnering with Omada Health, a digital platform that aims to help users manage chronic diseases, the two companies announced this morning.\nThe announcement, made at the annual JPMorgan healthcare conference in San Francisco, signals the e-commerce giant's continued focus on getting a share of the more than $4 trillion healthcare industry.\nThrough the partnership, Amazon will identify potential Omada customers based on their Amazon purchases; however, the partnership is limited to existing Omada customers who have benefits through their employer or other insurance plan. If a customer does not have access, Omada does not have a direct-to-consumer service plan.\nAmazon Health Services vice president Aaron Martin told Yahoo Finance that Amazon is hoping the program helps to lower overall health care ecosystem costs by helping patients better manage their health. Martin said that many Americans are unaware of the full scope of benefits offered by their employers, often leaving free services on the table that the employer has already paid for.\nOmada Health co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy told Yahoo Finance the idea was hatched over a dinner the two longtime business friends had a year and a half ago. Duffy said that Omada's size at that point helped push the conversation beyond a pilot program.\nHere's how the program will work: If a customer buys a Bluetooth scale, for example, or other equipment that could indicate medical needs, Amazon will push a widget through that asks the customer to check if they are eligible for health disease management services through Omada.\n\"What we're hoping to do in this is ... what Amazon has traditionally been very good at, which is make people aware, in this case of a product ... or a service that doesn't actually even cost them anything more,\" Martin said.\nCustomers will enter their name, date of birth, company name, and insurer in order to help Amazon see if the person is already receiving the benefit.\nBy allowing Amazon to collect this data, customers can also allow Amazon to save their details in the event they are not currently eligible but are in the future. And there is a way to remove the data.\n\"If a customer does not want to retain their information on Amazon, our customer service agents can assist with unenrolling their account,\" and all the data they provided to begin with, a spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.\nOmada Health launched in 2011 as a chronic care virtual management system. It offers diabetes, heart health, musculoskeletal, GLP-1, and obesity management services. It has been recognized by the CDC for its digital diabetes prevention program and competed with Livongo for partnerships with insurers and other firms in diabetes management until the latter was acquired by Teladoc in 2020. Omada has had a longstanding partnership with Cigna (CI) since 2015, which includes a $50 million funding round from Cigna in 2017.\nIt offers its services through Cigna's members, as well as through employer, university, and county benefits plans. Duffy said Omada currently works with 1,900 employers and has enrolled more than 1 million members \u2014 about 1 in 10 commercially insured adults in the US.\nThe partnership with Amazon is not exclusive, according to Martin. And Amazon intends to add more partners for its new program focused on other chronic health and disease management needs.\nMartin declined to reveal further details of the partnership and what financial benefits, such as from referral fees, Amazon receives from the relationship.\nDuffy said there is no two-way street or cross-promotion, and Omada has similar relationships with other retail vendors. But Amazon's scale is a huge differentiator.\n\"There's nothing else in the world like this,\" Duffy said. But he added if the experience works well for customers by allowing them to find out about a health benefit they didn't realize they had, it could result in greater use of Amazon's site.\nAmazon's Martin said the move capitalizes on the fact that many people \"use Amazon every day.\"\nWhen pushed for further clarity on who is gaining financially and how, neither provided details.\n\"There is an economic relationship that we're just not ready to disclose between us and Omada,\" Martin said.\nHe also declined to reveal what other disease areas or types of platforms could become part of the new program.\nBut the new partnership is in line with the messaging Amazon has been sending on health care: It cannot disrupt the industry alone and needs partners in order to succeed.\n\"I think the problem is that health care is a little bit cordoned off from the rest of our daily lives. And if we can kind of make it a little bit more pervasive, perhaps more people would engage with solutions, and [it would] help make them healthier,\" Martin said.\nThe program has actually been live for a few weeks, Martin said, though he declined to provide further details about customer engagement levels.\nAnjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After its shares tanked in 2022, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), like many of its big tech peers, had a remarkable bounce-back year in 2023. And as we enter 2024, investors will find it very easy to be optimistic. \nThe possibility of a stronger economic backdrop this year can drive better business results. And with the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, investor enthusiasm could rise even more. \nBesides these points, here are three compelling reasons to buy Amazon stock like there's no tomorrow.\nI think a key reason why Amazon makes for such a wonderful investment is that it benefits from numerous growth drivers. Of course, most investors are familiar with the company's dominance in e-commerce. Amazon went from selling just books online to now selling anything imaginable. And it now attracts 38% of all online spending that happens in the U.S.\nThis lead means that Amazon should continue to gain a large chunk of the growth of the e-commerce sector. With less than 16% of retail spending in the U.S. as e-commerce, there is a long runway to go.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud division that controls about a third of the global market, is also incredibly important. AWS will continue benefiting as enterprises shift their spending off-premises thanks to cost savings and flexibility. Grand View Research thinks the cloud industry will hit $1.6 trillion in revenue by 2030, putting AWS in an advantageous position.\nBehind only Alphabet's YouTube and Netflix, Amazon Prime Video is the third-most popular streaming service in terms of TV viewing time in the U.S. As this form of entertainment continues becoming more popular in the years ahead, compared to traditional cable TV, Amazon has a lucrative tool to drive subscription revenue.\nThen there's digital advertising, an up-and-coming segment that is boosted by the popularity of the online marketplace. Because Amazon.com had 4.7 billion visitors in the month of November, it's a smart place to place ads. This division raked in $12.1 billion of revenue in the third quarter of 2023, up 25% year over year.\nIt's also a fantastic idea to buy Amazon stock because of the company's wide economic moat. This factor helps bolster Amazon's competitive standing and protects it against the possibility of disruption.\nFor starters, the company's scale is unmatched. By operating an enormous logistics footprint, Amazon is able to ship products at low costs. And this helps improve the customer experience.\nThe online marketplace benefits from powerful network effects. Those 4.7 billion visitors attract merchants looking to sell to a massive customer base. And with more sellers on the platform, there is a gargantuan selection of merchandise to shop from as a result. So the marketplace gets more valuable as it gets larger.\nAmazon's data advantage also cannot be ignored. In the digital age, this becomes even more important. The e-commerce operations can glean insights from all the data collected about shopper behavior, which can then be used to improve features on the site.\nAnd thanks to its dominance in the cloud industry, AWS can amass more data from its clients than rival firms, which can be directed toward various initiatives, especially when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI).\nBesides multiple growth engines and an economic moat stemming from lots of sources, investors should buy Amazon stock like there's no tomorrow because of its reasonable valuation. Its shares soared 81% in 2023, crushing the Nasdaq Composite's gain of 43%. But the stock remains about 20% below its peak price, and it trades at a price-to-sales multiple of 2.8 right now. That's below its 10-year historical average.\nInvestors are faced with an opportunity to buy one of the best businesses in the world at a valuation that isn't ridiculous at all. Now is a good time to act.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Title": "Amazon is more profitable than ever after a year of mass layoffs",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "Amazon recorded its highest operating profit in its history in the holiday quarter of 2023, buoyed by revenue growth across all its major business lines and a year of heavy cost-cutting under the direction of CEO Andy Jassy.\nThe company announced on Thursday that its operating income \u2013 or profit from its core business operations that excludes certain items like investments in other firms and interest expenses \u2013 grew 383% year over year to $13.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, marking the second straight quarter in which Amazon has achieved its highest operating profit ever.\nThe record profits come as Jassy, who took over for Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2021, continues to put his own stamp on the tech giant, in part through heavy job cuts.\nAmazon previously announced 27,000 corporate layoffs, which began in 2022 and continued into 2023, marking the largest corporate layoff in the tech giant\u2019s history. Then, earlier this year, Amazon announced hundreds of job cuts across its gaming and video divisions. Going forward, Amazon isn\u2019t opposed to making more job cuts either, Amazon chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said in a call with reporters on Thursday.\nAmazon will \u201ccontinue to be careful on what we invest in, continue to invest in new things and new areas\u2026[but] where we can find efficiencies and do more with less, we are going to do that as well.\u201d\nAmazon, under Jassy, is boosting its bottom line through other means as well. Revenue growth inside Amazon\u2019s two most profitable divisions \u2013 Amazon Web Services and Amazon\u2019s massive advertising business \u2013 accelerated in the fourth quarter, and Olsavsky said the company expects that acceleration to continue in AWS into 2024.\nWhile Amazon declined to say how much of AWS\u2019 growth is coming from a surge of corporate interest in generative AI apps and services, Jassy told Wall Street analysts that he expects the area to produce tens of billions of dollars in revenue in the coming years.\nThe record operating profit was just one highlight from a blockbuster fourth-quarter earnings report that sent Amazon shares up more than 8% in after-hours trading. Revenue from Amazon\u2019s online retail business in North America grew 8% excluding currency fluctuations, marking the fastest growth for that segment in five quarters. Executives said the massive e-commerce business benefited from expanded holiday promotions and increased delivery speeds that successfully attracted many last-minute holiday shoppers.\nDo you have insights or a tip to share?

Andy Jassy, formerly head of AWS, became CEO of Amazon in 2021 and is executing exceptionally well. Because of their scale, AWS and Amazon retail benefit from numerous competitive advantages, which in turn drive a high customer value proposition. For example, instead of using the benefits of size to maximize short-term profits, Amazon operates with a scale-economies-shared business model, giving back some of its margin to the underlying consumer. This in turn drives further demand and strengthens the company\u2019s ecosystem. Amazon\u2019s long-term strategy masks the underlying earnings power of the business.

        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In the third quarter of 2023 (ended Sept. 30), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) generated revenue of $143 billion. The vast majority of this, about $92 billion, was derived from online stores and third-party seller services, which are directly related to the company's insanely successful digital marketplace.\nIt has long been the case that Amazon's e-commerce operations were the bread and butter of the business. After all, the company was founded with the goal of selling books online, which eventually turned into consumers being able to buy just about anything they wanted from the comfort of their homes.\nWith so many billions in e-commerce revenue, investors may be surprised to learn that this tech titan generated 62% of its Q3 operating income from an entirely different segment. Here's what you need to know.\nGenerating over $23 billion in sales last quarter, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides businesses and governments with various tech infrastructure services, like computing power, storage capacity, and database management. Compared to investing in IT tools on-site, these cloud computing customers benefit from lower costs and from having the flexibility to adjust their needs up or down at any time. This frees up capital that would otherwise be tied up in long-term projects.\nAWS, whose clients include Walt Disney, Verizon Communications, and Capital One, is tiny (as measured by revenue) when compared to the company overall. But its profitability is notable. The segment posted a stellar 30% operating margin in Q3, generating $7 billion in Q3 operating income. For comparison's sake, Amazon as a whole reported $11.2 billion in operating income last quarter.\nThis outsized profitability demonstrates the monster potential of AWS. It has long dominated the industry, with about one-third of the global market share. As it continues scaling up, it's easy to believe that margins will keep expanding. In the first quarter of 2015, AWS registered an operating margin of 17%, so it has improved over time.\nBut it was discouraging to see AWS' chief rivals, Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, posting much faster revenue growth in the latest quarter. Of course, they are starting from a smaller sales base, but this is not a good trend.\nCEO Andy Jassy doesn't seem worried. \"We're seeing the pace and volume of closed deals pick up, and we're encouraged by the strong last couple of months of new deals signed,\" he said optimistically on the Q3 2023 earnings call.\nAnd zooming out, there is a ton of growth to be achieved. Grand View Research estimates that by 2030, the global market for cloud infrastructure services will be worth a whopping $1.6 trillion in annual revenue, rising at about 14% per year until then. As the clear leader in the industry, AWS is in a prime position to benefit from this trend.\nWhile AWS is certainly a major growth and profitability driver for Amazon, investors shouldn't completely ignore other divisions that are critical to the operations as well. \nIt's hard to envision a scenario where the online marketplace doesn't remain the focal point for the business for the foreseeable future. Management has made huge investments to bolster the company's logistics footprint to better serve customers, and this will continue to provide benefits when drawing in shoppers looking for low prices and fast shipping.\nThe popularity of Amazon.com has spawned another booming revenue source. Most investors might not know that Amazon currently produces the third-most digital advertising revenue in the world, behind only Alphabet and Meta Platforms. This is just another growth engine the company can lean on.\nNonetheless, it's almost a certainty that AWS will keep rising in importance in the years ahead.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "A Look At The Fair Value Of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The projected fair value for Amazon.com is US$197 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nWith US$159 share price, Amazon.com appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\n Analyst price target for AMZN is US$184 which is 6.7% below our fair value estimate\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n Check out our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$57.7b\nUS$75.7b\nUS$84.7b\nUS$90.2b\nUS$107.7b\nUS$117.0b\nUS$124.8b\nUS$131.5b\nUS$137.3b\nUS$142.4b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x13\nAnalyst x10\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x4\nAnalyst x4\nEst @ 8.61%\nEst @ 6.69%\nEst @ 5.35%\nEst @ 4.41%\nEst @ 3.75%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% \nUS$53.7k\nUS$65.5k\nUS$68.2k\nUS$67.6k\nUS$75.1k\nUS$75.8k\nUS$75.3k\nUS$73.8k\nUS$71.7k\nUS$69.2k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$696b\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.5%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$142b\u00d7 (1 + 2.2%) \u00f7 (7.5%\u2013 2.2%) = US$2.8t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$2.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$1.3t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.0t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$159, the company appears about fair value at a 19% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.054. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nCurrent share price is below our estimate of fair value.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "Title": "Will Amazon Be Worth More Than Apple by 2030?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Five years ago, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was more valuable than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The e-commerce and cloud leader had a market cap of $821 billion, while the maker of iPhones, iPads, and Macs was worth $744 billion.\nBut today, Amazon is worth $1.64 trillion, while Apple has a market cap of $2.98 trillion. Let's see why Amazon fell behind Apple -- and if it might catch up and eclipse its market cap again by 2030.\nAmazon generates most of its revenue from its e-commerce marketplaces, but most of its profits come from its cloud platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Both businesses experienced accelerating and decelerating growth over the past five years.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon's e-commerce and cloud growth accelerated as more people shopped online and more companies signed up for its cloud-based services. But it faced tough year-over-year comparisons after the pandemic ended, and both businesses struggled as inflation curbed consumer spending and rising rates forced companies to rein in their spending on cloud-based services. AWS also grew at a slower rate than its closest competitor, Microsoft's Azure, as the latter ramped up its investments in its new artificial intelligence (AI) features.\nThat's why Amazon's revenue growth decelerated over the past three years. Jeff Bezos' departure from the CEO role in 2021 also strongly suggested its high-growth days were over.\nMetric\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023 (Forecast)\nRevenue growth\n20%\n38%\n22%\n9%\n2%\nData source: Amazon, analysts' estimates.\nTo make matters worse, Amazon's investment in Rivian\u00a0backfired as the electric vehicle (EV) maker's stock plummeted over the past two years. That investment caused Amazon to post a whopping net loss of $2.7 billion in 2022.\nIf Amazon matches analysts' expectations for 2023, its revenue will have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% from 2019. By comparison, Apple grew its revenue at a CAGR of 10% from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last September) as it also went through its own cycle of accelerating and decelerating growth.\nMetric\nFY 2019\nFY 2020\nFY 2021\nFY 2022\nFY 2023\nRevenue growth\n(2%)\n6%\n33%\n8%\n(3%)\nData source: Apple.\nApple's growth accelerated into fiscal 2021 as it launched its first 5G iPhones. But that upgrade cycle cooled off over the past two years -- and that slowdown was exacerbated by its persistent macro, competitive, and regulatory challenges in China.\nNevertheless, Apple's stock continued rising because its challenges seemed cyclical and its mountain of cash and marketable securities ($162 billion at the end of fiscal 2023) made it a safe-haven investment amid inflation and rising rates. Amazon held $64 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in the third quarter of 2023.\nApple also bought back 16% of its shares over the past five years, while Amazon's share count rose 5% during the same period. Apple only pays a tiny forward dividend yield of 0.5%, but Amazon doesn't pay anything at all. Those shareholder-friendly strategies likely made Apple a more compelling play for long-term investors than Amazon.\nAmazon's stock isn't cheap right now, at 44 times forward earnings. But looking ahead, analysts expect its revenue to rise at a CAGR of 11% from 2023 to 2025 as the macroeconomic environment improves. They also expect its EPS to grow at a CAGR of 33%.\nApple's stock seems cheaper at 29 times forward earnings. However, analysts only expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 5% from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, and for its EPS to rise at a CAGR of 9%. We should take all of those estimates with a grain of salt, but Apple could certainly struggle if it doesn't diversify its top line away from the aging iPhone.\nAmazon could continue to grow faster than Apple through the end of the decade, but its valuations are a bit stretched. If Amazon maintains its current valuations, matches analysts' expectations, and grows its EPS at a CAGR of 20% from 2025 to 2030, its market cap would reach $5.5 trillion by the final year. If Apple does the same thing and grows its EPS at a CAGR of 10% from fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2030, it would be worth $5.2 trillion.\nTherefore, Amazon has a narrow path toward overtaking Apple again by 2030, but only if it stabilizes its e-commerce and cloud businesses. If either of those growth engines sputter out, its price-to-earnings ratio could plummet and prevent it from ever matching Apple's market cap. Apple's lower multiple, reputation as a safe-haven play, and constant buybacks arguably give it a much clearer path toward reaching a $5 trillion valuation.\nA lot could happen over the next six years, but I suspect Amazon will still be worth less than Apple by 2030. Both stocks are still solid long-term investments, but Amazon simply faces more unpredictable challenges than Apple -- which can continue to leverage its scale, luxury appeal, and expanding ecosystem to lock in more consumers.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$142b\u00d7 (1 + 2.2%) \u00f7 (7.5%\u2013 2.2%) = US$2.8t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$2.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$1.3t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.0t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$152, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.053. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

        "Title": "Amazon (AMZN) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Amazon (AMZN) reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 1, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis online retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +281%.\nRevenues are expected to be $166.19 billion, up 11.4% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.81% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amazon?\nFor Amazon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.58%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\nSo, this combination indicates that Amazon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Amazon would post earnings of $0.58 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.85, delivering a surprise of +46.55%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nAmazon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\nAnother stock from the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, Match Group (MTCH), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.49 per share for the quarter ended December 2023.

        "Title": "Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 10 Years?",
        "Author": "  Demitri Kalogeropoulos, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The best stock market returns accumulate over decades rather than quarters. That's why billionaire investor Warren Buffett cites his longevity as a key supporting factor in his portfolio's massive growth over the last several decades. \"It helps to start early and live into your 90's,\" he told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in this year's annual report.\nGrowth-stock investors can seek to replicate some of his success by taking a much longer outlook on their investments. With that goal in mind, let's look at Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) prospects for success in the coming decade. Where will the business, and the stock, be by early 2034?\nE-commerce will always be a big part of Amazon's business, but the future seems to be all about its services sales. That segment is anchored by the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform and includes things like Prime subscriptions and advertising sales. Through the first three quarters of 2023, that unit clocked in at $226 billion, or 56% of sales, and was expanding at a much faster rate than the e-commerce segment.\nIt wouldn't be a stretch to think that in a decade, Amazon's business might look more like Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) does today. It will sell products, sure, but almost all its profits will come from cloud and software services.\nThis shift has a good shot at enhancing profitability and boosting cash flow, as investors have already seen in the last few quarters. Amazon likely won't have Microsoft's 40% profit margin by 2034 but should post much stronger results than its current 4% level. And positive stock returns will track along with those financial improvements.\nIf you don't think artificial intelligence (AI) is a priority for Amazon, consider that the term \"generative AI\" showed up 18 times in its most recent earnings release. That tech is now deeply embedded in the AWS platform, which is already helping many of its biggest customers with their own AI projects.\nAmazon is also using it to improve the shopping and selling experiences on its e-commerce store, for example by sifting through product reviews to highlight factors that previous buyers have frequently mentioned.\nThere's no telling how AI will develop over the next decade, but it appears likely that Amazon will join other tech giants like Microsoft in leading the shift into this computing era. It's also unclear right now what impact the technology will have on Amazon's finances.\nThe early signs are encouraging, though. Generative AI is popular because it is creating more value across a wide range of business processes. That makes it probable that the technology will lift Amazon's profit margins even as it helps accelerate sales growth in the next decade.\nAmazon is currently valued more like a retailer than a software-as-a-service stock. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3 is closer to eBay's P/S of 2 than it is to Microsoft's ratio of 13 times annual sales.\nAmazon should close that gap with Microsoft over time if it continues shifting its business toward services sales while capitalizing on the AI boom. Many factors -- including a slowdown in spending on information technology, or a wider recession -- could delay or even derail these ambitions.\nBut Amazon stock seems primed to generate solid returns for patient investors over the next several years.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Amazon made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks\n\u00a0\n*Stock Advisor returns as of December 18, 2023\n\u00a0\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "Author": "  Jeannine Mancini ",
        "Text": "Taking a chance on something unknown is always intimidating. It's easy to pass up an opportunity, especially when its success seems uncertain. But what if that opportunity was Amazon?\nIn 1994, Jeff Bezos, a then 30-year-old hedge fund manager, was seeking funding for a revolutionary idea: an online bookshop. To realize this vision, Bezos embarked on a quest to secure investments of approximately $50,000 each from potential investors, primarily targeting family members, friends and others who might be willing to take a risk on his concept.\nDon't Miss:\nCopy and paste Mark Cuban\u2019s startup investment strategy according to his colorful portfolio.\nAirbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This startup is automating the trillion-dollar hospitality market.\nBezos's journey to raise funds for his nascent company was no small feat. He held 60 meetings, tirelessly pitching his idea to convince others of its potential. Despite his efforts, he faced numerous rejections. Out of the 60 people he approached, only 22 were convinced to invest in his idea, contributing to the $1 million he needed to start Amazon.com Inc. In total, he gave up 20% to early investors, according to a 2013 article on Geekwire.\nThe 22 people who leaped included Bezos's parents, Mike and Jackie Bezos, as well as his younger brother Mark and sister Christina. Bezos's parents emerged as major winners after investing $300,000 for a 6% stake in the company.\nA 2016 Business Insider article highlighted that a $50,000 investment in Amazon at the early stages for a 1% stake in the company would have been worth approximately $3.5 billion that year, provided those stakes had never been diluted by later investors.\nTrending: Here is where your most successful angel investment may be hidden.\nFast forward to 2024, and that same investment would now be valued at approximately $15.9 billion based on Amazon's January market capitalization of approximately $1.59 trillion to $1.604 trillion. This figure showcases Amazon's growth and success that potentially transformed early backers into billionaires. It\u2019s unknown whether these investors retained their entire stakes; this estimate merely calculates the potential growth of the original investment.\nSome of those who declined to invest in Amazon still find it too painful to discuss their decision, knowing they missed out on becoming billionaires. Meanwhile, others recognize that they have led fulfilling lives regardless of the missed opportunity. As Bezos reflected in an on-stage interview posted by The Guardian in 2018, \"Some people are just better at rolling with the punches.\"\nIn 1994, the internet was far from mainstream, and many were skeptical about its potential. This skepticism was reflected in the reactions of potential investors. As Bezos recalled, \"The first question people had, was what was the internet?\" He noted that anyone with knowledge of the book business did not invest, illustrating the challenge of convincing people to invest in an unfamiliar and unproven concept.\nThe early investment rounds of Amazon are a prime example of the potential rewards of investing in startups. They underscore the significance of vision and the willingness to take risks in the entrepreneurial world. Bezos\u2019s ability to recognize the possibilities of the internet and e-commerce and to convince a select group of investors to support his vision was crucial in Amazon\u2019s journey from a tiny startup to one of the most valuable companies in the world.\nRead Next: \nHedge funds intend to snatch all pre-IPO shares of future AI unicorns before you can.

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If your family is like mine, you kept Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) busy over the last few months. Rarely a day went by when we didn't have at least one Amazon package at our doorsteps.\nAmazon's e-commerce unit has made the company a household name. The scale of its operations surpasses all others. So it would make sense if Amazon rakes in most of its profits from e-commerce. But it doesn't. Nearly three-quarters -- 74% -- of its operating income comes from another source.\nTo be sure, Amazon's e-commerce business generates the most revenue for the company. In the first nine months of 2023, Amazon's net revenue totaled a little over $66.5 billion. The company's North American and International segments, which focus primarily on e-commerce, together accounted for 83.6% of that revenue. Cloud platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) contributed the rest.\nGranted, not all of the revenue in the North American and International segments comes from e-commerce. Amazon also operates some physical stores (including Whole Foods) and makes an increasing amount of money from advertising. However, the company's online stores and third-party seller services, which fall squarely into the e-commerce category, rake in the lion's share of the company's total sales.\nBut it's a completely different story when it comes to operating income. Amazon posted consolidated operating income of $23.6 billion in the first nine months of 2023. AWS contributed nearly $17.5 billion, or roughly 74%, of that total.\nOperating income is sometimes referred to as operating profit. It measures the amount of money left over after subtracting operating expenses including the cost of goods sold (COGS) from revenue. It's not the same as net profit (which also subtracts taxes and interest expense), but they're closely related.\nWhy is AWS so profitable for Amazon? The cloud unit's operating expenses as a percentage of net sales are much lower than the percentages for the company's North America and International segments. That shouldn't be surprising. The massive logistics network and infrastructure required to support Amazon's e-commerce operations are expensive.\nOf course, AWS' operating costs aren't insignificant. Amazon spends a lot of money on the cloud services unit's technology infrastructure and the staff who run it.\nThose costs could rise as Amazon invests more heavily in artificial intelligence apps and tools for AWS. CFO Brian Olsavsky noted in the company's Q3 conference call that Amazon plans to increase its investments in generative AI and large language models, in particular. to \"support the growth of our AWS business.\" However, it's a virtual certainty that AWS will continue to be Amazon's biggest profit machine.\nAmazon's e-commerce business still has plenty of room to grow. E-commerce made up only 15.6% of total U.S. retail sales in 2023 Q3. The market penetration is even lower in some parts of the world.\nHowever, the great news for Amazon is the opportunity for AWS. The explosion in the use of generative AI last year likely only represents the tip of the iceberg. As progress is made toward achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), the momentum for AI is likely to accelerate.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy has said on several occasions that only 5% to 10% of global IT spending is currently in the cloud with most spending still on-premises. Jassy believes those numbers will flip over the next 10 to 15 years. If he's right (and I suspect he is), AWS should be a huge winner from the trend.\nYes, AWS faces some strong rivals with their own impressive cloud platforms. Jassy, though, argued in the Q3 call that \"customers want to bring the [AI] models to their data, not the other way around.\" He quickly added, \"And much of that data resides in AWS as the clear market segment leader in cloud infrastructure.\"\nThe bottom line is that Amazon's biggest growth driver is also its most profitable business, by far. That should bode well for the company's long-term earnings outlook. And where earnings go, stock prices tend to follow.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Title": "Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Seems To Use Debt Quite Sensibly",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) makes use of debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nThe chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Amazon.com had US$79.7b in debt in September 2023; about the same as the year before. On the flip side, it has US$64.2b in cash leading to net debt of about US$15.5b.\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Amazon.com had liabilities of US$145.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$158.7b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$64.2b in cash and US$37.7b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$202.1b.\nGiven Amazon.com has a humongous market capitalization of US$1.62t, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward. But either way, Amazon.com has virtually no net debt, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.\nAmazon.com's net debt is only 0.21 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 39.5 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. On top of that, Amazon.com grew its EBIT by 99% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Amazon.com's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Amazon.com recorded negative free cash flow, in total. Debt is far more risky for companies with unreliable free cash flow, so shareholders should be hoping that the past expenditure will produce free cash flow in the future.\nHappily, Amazon.com's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But we must concede we find its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow has the opposite effect. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that Amazon.com can handle its debt fairly comfortably. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Amazon.com, you may well want to click here to check an interactive graph of its earnings per share history.\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The new year is here, and there are plenty of reasons to be bullish about the next 12 months. 2023 had a tricky start, coming out of a year where the Nasdaq Composite had plunged 33% amid macroeconomic headwinds. However, the situation is much more positive as we begin 2024.\nIn 2023, the Nasdaq Composite rose 43%, fueled by easing inflation and excitement over burgeoning sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI). The market will probably continue trending up in the coming months, with now an excellent time to consider investing in companies set up to flourish this year and beyond.\nAs titans of their respective industries, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are two attractive growth stocks with exciting developments in 2024. Amazon has posted multiple quarters of surging growth in its retail business, while Apple will launch its highly anticipated virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset.\nSo let's look at whether Amazon or Apple is the better growth stock in 2024.\nAmazon has delivered an impressive comeback over the past 12 months after suffering steep declines in its e-commerce business in 2022.\nIn its latest quarter, the third quarter of 2023, the company posted 13% year-over-year revenue growth, beating Wall Street forecasts by $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, its North American segment exceeded $4 billion in operating income, significantly improving on the $412 million in losses it reported in the year-ago period.\nThe tech giant owes much of its growth over the past year to various cost-cutting moves, such as closing or canceling construction on dozens of warehouses, shuttering unprofitable programs such as Amazon Care, and laying off thousands of people. The restructuring saw Amazon's free cash flow rise 427% over the past year to $17 billion.\nAs a result, the company is starting 2024 in excellent form. With lower expenses, it has the funds to fuel its R&D as it continues to expand in AI and overcome potential headwinds.\nAmazon is leading two crucial markets with its e-commerce and cloud computing services, with its business likely to deliver significant gains for years.\nApple didn't have it as easy as Amazon in 2023, as an economic downturn led to consumer pullback and repeated declines in its product sales.\nFor the fiscal year, the company's revenue fell 3% year over year after its highest earnings segment, the iPhone, saw revenue tumble 2% alongside dips in Mac, iPad, and wearable sales.\nHowever, there's reason to believe the current challenges are only temporary, meaning it's still worth investing in Apple. The company has built immense brand loyalty with its users, which resulted in the third largest market share in e-commerce in the U.S. despite offering a significantly fewer products compared to industry leaders Amazon and Walmart.\nThe popularity of Apple's products bodes well for its soon-to-be-launched Vision Pro, its first VR/AR headset, which will hit the shelves in 2024. Data from Fortune Business Insights shows the VR market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 31% until at least 2030.\nMeanwhile, Apple has a reputation for entering new markets and quickly rising to dominance, attracting consumers with its focus on quality, connectivity between its devices, and easy-to-use design language.\nApple hit nearly $100 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Alongside a highly lucrative digital services business, the company remains an attractive growth stock for the new year.\nAmazon and Apple dominate their respective industries and are unlikely to be dethroned anytime soon. They have long histories of delivering consistent and significant gains, making them some of the best growth stocks out there. However, just because a company is leading an industry, that doesn't necessarily mean it's trading at the right price.\nThis chart compares both companies' price-to-sales (P/S) ratios, with Amazon's lower figure suggesting its shares are currently the better value. P/S is calculated by dividing a company's total market cap by its trailing-12-month revenue. As a result, Amazon's solid performance and financial growth have made it the better growth stock and set it up to be an excellent investment for 2024.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Amazon (AMZN) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.11, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.11 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 46 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 42 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 91.3% and 6.5% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AMZN\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Amazon, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs AMZN Worth Investing In?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 1.6% over the past month to $2.70.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon.

        "Title": "3 Amazon Stock Predictions for 2024",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In early 2023, I made three predictions for Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock investors. Let's see how I did:\nI predicted that Amazon's e-commerce sales would bounce back. In the three quarters reported for 2023 thus far, online sales growth has accelerated from the corresponding prior-year periods, so I'll put that in the win column.\nMy call that Amazon would dive further into healthcare played out as well. Amazon completed its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical; rolled out RxPass, a monthly prescription service; and launched Amazon One Medical for Prime, offering Prime subscribers access to certain healthcare services for $9 per month.\nI also correctly called that Amazon would maintain its lead in cloud computing. Through the first three quarters of 2023, Amazon controlled roughly 30% of the market, on average, with Microsoft coming in at 25% and Alphabet's Google Cloud maintaining 9%.\nAs a bonus prediction, I posited that Amazon stock would rebound from its historic lows, and boy howdy, was I right. After losing half its value in 2022, Amazon stock soared 81% in 2023, making it one of big tech's top performers.\nI was correct in all three of my prognostications and also scored during the bonus round, though each of those seems like a slam dunk in hindsight. Let's see if I can keep my streak going with three predictions for 2024.\nWhile Amazon maintained its seat atop the cloud heap, its growth struggled. Since peaking in the fourth quarter of 2021, year-over-year growth has decelerated with each successive quarter. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as that was right about the time the downturn began, with the economy only recently regaining its footing.\nIn the third quarter, Amazon Web Services (AWS) finally stabilized, matching the 12% growth it generated in the second quarter. I predict that growth will continue to stabilize, before reaccelerating and marching higher in 2024, fueled by an improving economy.\nThis prediction is inexorably tied to the first. Despite improving macroeconomic conditions, last year's stock market recovery was largely uneven. The biggest winners were the companies best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity represented by advances in generative AI.\nEarly last year, while Microsoft and Alphabet were stealing the spotlight, releasing generative AI tools on their respective platforms, Amazon was largely absent from the conversation. That led some to conclude that Amazon was \"behind\" in the AI race, a perception that still lingers.\nAmazon is working to change that. Late last year, the company released Amazon Q, its own generative AI-powered digital assistant, designed to help increase productivity among AWS cloud users. Q taps into company-specific sources to answer questions, generate content, and streamline a variety of tasks. AWS also offers a wealth of generative AI models via Amazon Bedrock, as well as providing access to Nvidia's latest AI chips, the H200 Tensor Core graphics processing units.\nIt's important to remember that it's still early days in generative AI, as the current iteration of the technology has only been public for roughly 14 months. There's still plenty of time for Amazon to stake its claim, and as the world's largest cloud provider, it's well-placed to do just that.\nNot only will Amazon's cloud growth reaccelerate, but the company will become a force to be reckoned with in generative AI, with AWS as the facilitator.\nDespite a run-up of 81% in 2023, the aforementioned catalysts suggest there's still growth ahead for Amazon. There's also the company's industry-leading e-commerce platform, which has struggled in the face of high inflation. Furthermore, Amazon is a growing force in digital advertising, with ad sales that grew 23% to $32.2 billion through the first nine months of 2023, outpacing the growth of its largest rivals, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, which grew 4% and 13%, respectively.\nAmazon's continuing dominance in e-commerce and cloud computing, coupled with its growing importance in digital advertising and generative AI, will fuel solid financial results, driving additional stock price gains in 2024, pushing its market cap above $2 trillion.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "People Think Amazon Is an E-Commerce Company, but 74% of Its Profit Comes From This Instead",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a technology powerhouse. It was founded in 1994, and it amassed a $1.5 trillion valuation in the 30 years since.\nThe company originally sold books online, though its catalog has expanded to include an estimated 12 million products. In 2023, Amazon accounted for 37.6% of all e-commerce sales in America, which was light-years ahead of second-place Walmart at 6.3%.\nBut here's the thing. Online sales -- combined with all of its other businesses except one -- accounted for a minority of Amazon's operating income through the first three quarters of 2023 (ended Sept. 30). In 2022, they contributed no operating income at all.\nBelow, I'll tell you where Amazon generates the overwhelming majority of its profit, and it's a segment all investors should watch very closely in the future.\nBefore we dive into Amazon's profitability, let's look at where its revenue comes from. While the company is still very much focused on its e-commerce business, it expanded significantly over the years to operate in cloud computing, digital advertising, robotics, and streaming.\nAmazon generated $143.1 billion in total revenue during the latest third quarter, and here's where it came from:\nSegment\nQ3 Revenue (Billions)\nPercentage of Total Revenue\nOnline stores\n$57.3\n40%\nThird-party seller services\n$34.3\n24%\nAmazon Web Services\n$23\n16.1%\nAdvertising services\n$12.1\n8.5%\nSubscription services\n$10.2\n7.1%\nPhysical stores\n$4.9\n3.5%\nOther\n$1.2\n0.8%\nData source: Amazon.\nAs you can see, online sales were still Amazon's largest source of revenue. Commissions and fees charged to third-party sellers on Amazon's platform were the second-largest contributor.\nAdvertising services are becoming increasingly important as Amazon finds new ways to sell digital ad spots to businesses on its website and through its streaming platforms like Prime and Twitch. In Q3, advertising services revenue grew by 25% year over year, the fastest pace of any segment.\nBut the most important business of all might be Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's the largest cloud computing platform in the world, delivering hundreds of digital solutions to businesses. It helps them store data, host their digital sales channels, develop software, and now, build artificial intelligence (AI) applications. The latter could be Amazon's greatest financial opportunity ever.\nFor reporting purposes, Amazon breaks its operations into two categories: net product sales and net service sales. But that doesn't really tell us where its profits are coming from specifically. Therefore, the company provides a more granular look at its financials by splitting them into three categories: North American sales, international sales, and AWS.\nAs discussed earlier, Amazon has seven main business segments. North American and international sales aggregate the financial results from six of them, with AWS' financials reported separately. There's a good reason for that.\nIn the first three quarters of 2023, AWS delivered operating income of $17.4 billion. By comparison, North American and international sales combined generated operating income of just $6.1 billion.\nRemember, AWS revenue only accounts for 16.1% of Amazon's total revenue, yet it was responsible for a whopping 74% of the entire company's operating income.\nCloud computing carries a high operating margin because selling digital services is a scalable business model. One data center can serve the needs of thousands of businesses all over the world, which rent its computing power to run their digital operations. In Q3, AWS delivered an operating margin of 30.3%, whereas the combined operating margin from North American and international sales was just 1.8%.\nIn order for Amazon to charge low prices for products in its e-commerce segment, it has to operate on a razor-thin profit margin. Given that's the company's largest source of revenue, it sometimes drags down the financial results of smaller divisions even if they might be profitable on their own.\nIn 2022, North American and international sales delivered an operating loss of $10.6 billion, so AWS was responsible for 100% of Amazon's operating income for the year.\nAWS -- and specifically its growing presence in artificial intelligence -- has become a big reason investors want to own Amazon stock. The platform now offers its own AI data center chips to compete with Nvidia, and it has also developed a series of large language models in-house. It means businesses can access all the hardware and software they need to build AI applications on AWS.\nPlus, Amazon recently invested $4 billion in leading AI start-up Anthropic. It will use AWS as its primary cloud provider, and it will train its future models using Amazon's data center chips, which could entice other developers to try out the hardware, especially since Nvidia faces supply constraints.\nAmazon will report its official 2023 full-year financial results in early February, but its total revenue is expected to come in at $517 billion. Considering Amazon's current valuation of $1.5 trillion, that places its stock at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 2.7.\nThat's dirt cheap compared to Microsoft stock, which trades at a P/S ratio of 12.7. That company is home to the world's second-largest cloud platform, Azure, which also has a growing focus on AI. Microsoft deserves a premium because it's more profitable on the whole, although Amazon generates more than double the amount of revenue. I don't think Amazon's P/S ratio deserves to trade at such a steep 79% discount to Microsoft's.\nIn fact, Amazon is the cheapest of all the \"Magnificent Seven\" technology giants based on the P/S metric.\nPersonally, I think that valuation gap could begin to close in 2024 as AWS ramps up its efforts in AI, which could pave the way for upside in Amazon stock.\nDepending which Wall Street forecast you rely upon, that technology could add between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy in the next decade. So, it's likely AWS will continue to make up the lion's share of Amazon's operating income, and it could become even more critical to the company overall.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Text": "When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, the Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) share price is up 90% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 73% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 59%.\nLet's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nOver half a decade, Amazon.com managed to grow its earnings per share at 16% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 14% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..\nWe're pleased to report that Amazon.com shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 59% over one year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 14%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

        "Author": "  Jeannine Mancini ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com Inc.'s 2015 shareholders letter sheds light on the company's unique organizational culture, which has propelled the company to become the fastest ever to reach $100 billion in annual sales.\nAmazon Founder Jeff Bezos describes Amazon's culture as a blueprint for business success and a guide for embracing innovation and learning from failure. Amazon's success story, including the rapid growth of Amazon Web Services (AWS), is rooted in its corporate culture.\nBezos highlights the core principles of the company's culture, saying \"customer obsession rather than competitor obsession, eagerness to invent and pioneer, willingness to fail, the patience to think long-term and taking professional pride in operational excellence.\" These principles challenge the traditional corporate playbook, emphasizing long-term innovation and the acceptance of failure as a key component of progress.\nDon't Miss:\nJeff Bezos called the meteoric success of this real estate investing strategy early on. He bet millions on the growth of fractional investing, and you can get in on the action with as little as $100.\nAirbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This startup is automating the trillion-dollar hospitality market.\nAmazon's culture is unique for its blend of stability and adaptability. It thrives on attracting and retaining people who share a passion for pioneering and invention.\n\"Corporate cultures are enduring, stable, hard to change,\" Bezos wrote. \"They can be a source of advantage or disadvantage.\" Amazon's culture, therefore, is not just about the strategies it employs but also about the people who drive the strategies forward.\nA critical aspect where Amazon stands out is its approach to failure. \u201cOne area where I think we are especially distinctive is failure,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI believe we are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenty of practice!), and failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it\u2019s going to work, it\u2019s not an experiment.\u201d\nAmazon's approach to experimentation, even when it leads to unsuccessful outcomes, is what fuels its innovation engine. The successes of AWS, Marketplace and Prime are a testament to Amazon's risk-taking culture. These ventures, initially seen as bold and unconventional, have become pillars of Amazon's business, showcasing the rewards of risk-taking and innovation.\nIn 2023, Amazon announced eight significant innovations, including expanding its drone delivery program, integrating new robotic systems and reducing packaging waste. These initiatives demonstrate Amazon\u2019s commitment to delivering better for customers, supporting employees and contributing positively to communities. Such innovations are a testament to Amazon\u2019s ability to adapt and grow, even in the face of global economic challenges like the Great Recession of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic\u200b.\nThe company's culture remains a critical element in Amazon\u2019s trajectory, offering valuable insights and lessons for businesses and individuals alike.\nRead Next:\u00a0\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare?\nWhat decision made this 20-year-old a millionaire in 1 year?

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-01-01, Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $72.12. It's currently trading at a price of $151.945. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -110.68%. The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$2.1\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.87%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n12.88\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n6.01\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n72.12\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $20.35. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -646.66%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Better AI Stock: Microsoft vs. Amazon",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 triggered a boom in artificial intelligence (AI), with countless tech firms pivoting their businesses toward the budding industry.\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. That trajectory would see the sector exceed a value of $1 trillion before the end of the decade, suggesting there's no better time than the present to invest in AI-minded companies.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are two attractive options, with both companies investing heavily in the market and active in one of the biggest growth areas of AI: cloud computing. These companies have emerged as some of the biggest threats in the industry and could deliver significant gains over the long term.\nSo, let's take a closer look at these companies and determine whether Microsoft or Amazon is the better AI stock right now.\nMicrosoft was an early investor in AI, sinking $1 billion into OpenAI in 2019. The company has since increased its investment, achieving a 49% stake in the start-up. The partnership with OpenAI has granted Microsoft exclusive access to some of the most advanced AI models, which it has used to bring upgrades across its product lineup.\nOver the last year, elements of ChatGPT have been integrated into Microsoft's search engine Bing, a range of new AI tools have been added to its cloud platform Azure, and its various Office services now offer improved productivity with the help of AI.\nMicrosoft is a behemoth in the tech world, with millions of consumers and businesses relying on its software. The popularity of its services and OpenAI's tech could be a powerful combination over the long term.\nIn the first quarter of 2024 (ending September 2023), Microsoft posted 13% in year-over-year revenue growth, beating Wall Street estimates by nearly $2 billion. Significant gains came from the company's cloud and productivity segments, which saw revenue rise 19% and 13%, respectively. These divisions are hyperfocused on AI development, which appears to be paying off.\nAlongside free cash flow that hit $63 billion last year, Microsoft is on a promising growth path. The company has the brand power and financial resources to become one of the biggest threats in AI.\nAmazon pulled off an impressive turnaround in 2023 after its stock plunged roughly 50% the year before. Since last January, its shares have soared over 62% thanks to a return to profitability in its e-commerce business and significant potential in AI.\nOver the last year, various cost-cutting measures have seen Amazon's free cash flow skyrocket 427% to $16 billion. The company has restructured its business to prioritize profit growth and is, therefore, investing heavily in its most profitable division: Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nThe cloud platform is responsible for over 62% of Amazon's operating income despite earning the lowest revenue out of its three segments. In Q3 2023, AWS achieved nearly $7 billion in profits, representing growth of 29% year over year.\nThe cloud market is expanding quickly, boosted by the emergence of AI. Businesses are increasingly looking for ways to boost efficiency with the help of AI and turning to cloud services to do so. Meanwhile, AWS' leading 32% market share in cloud computing positions it well to see big gains as AI develops.\nAmazon's dominant position in cloud computing makes the company one of the best ways to invest in AI.\nMicrosoft and Amazon have emerged as two of the biggest names in AI over the last year. These companies have similar potential in the industry thanks to booming cloud businesses and lucrative opportunities in other areas of tech.\nAs a result, the best way to determine the better AI stock is to consider which is trading at a better value.\nThis chart compares Amazon and Microsoft's price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios. These are helpful valuation metrics as they take into account a company's financial health against its stock price.\nP/S is calculated by dividing a firm's market cap by its revenue. Meanwhile, PEG divides a stock's price-to-earnings ratio by the growth rate of its earnings. For both metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value.\nIn this case, Amazon's stock is a bargain compared to Microsoft. So, if you're between these two AI stocks, Amazon is the better buy this month and a screaming buy at the start of 2024.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks\n\u00a0\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 8, 2024\n\u00a0\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +2.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has gained 1.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $0.81 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +285.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.8%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.70 points to a change of +280.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.6%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.66 indicates a change of +35.5% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.6%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Amazon is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $166.23 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.4%. The $571.07 billion and $636.74 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.1% and +11.5%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAmazon reported revenues of $143.08 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.6%. EPS of $0.85 for the same period compares with $0.20 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $141.53 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.1%. The EPS surprise was +46.55%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAmazon is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Jeannine Mancini ",
        "Text": "In the mid-1990s, a $10,000 investment in a nascent online bookstore seemed risky, but for Jeff Bezos's siblings Mark and Christina, the decision may have catapulted them into the ranks of billionaires. A Bloomberg report reveals that in 1996, they each purchased 30,000 Amazon.com Inc. shares for $10,000. This investment has since grown exponentially, with each sibling\u2019s stake potentially reaching over $1 billion today, a 10,249,900% gain.\nAccording to an article by Luxury Launches, referencing a Bloomberg report from July 31, 2018, the stakes held by Jeff Bezos\u2019s siblings were valued at $640 million each, based on Amazon\u2019s stock closing price of $91 at the time. Fast forward to the present, and with Amazon\u2019s stock price at $149, their stakes are now valued at $1.044 billion each.\nDon't Miss:\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare?\nAirbnb was worth $47 billion at IPO. This startup is automating the trillion-dollar hospitality market.\nAre Wall Street's days numbered? This startup's game-changing solution could disrupt finance forever.\nBezos, recognizing the emerging potential of e-commerce, embarked on an ambitious venture by founding Amazon in July 1994. This was a time when the internet was primarily used by government and educational institutions. Despite these limitations, Bezos was undeterred and pursued his vision, seeing the broader possibilities that the internet could offer.\nConvincing investors, including his family, of the venture\u2019s potential despite a high risk of failure was a monumental task. Bezos cautioned his parents about the 70% risk of losing their investment. According to the book \"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,\" he said, \"I want you to know what the risks are because I still want to come home for Thanksgiving if this doesn't work.\"\nIn 1994, Bezos reportedly held 60 meetings with family members, friends and potential investors in an attempt to persuade them to invest in his online bookshop idea. Out of the 60 people he approached, 38 were not convinced. Years later, Bezos reflected on these early rejections, noting how some of those who declined his offer were still affected by their decision, either accepting it as part of life or finding it too painful to discuss.\nAmazon\u2019s journey to success was fraught with challenges. It went public on May 15, 1997, at $18 per share, navigating through the turbulent times of the dot-com bubble. Yet, under Bezos\u2019s leadership, the company not only survived but flourished, expanding beyond online retail and achieving a market cap of $1.5 trillion.\nTrending: This brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it?\nMark and Christina Bezos, despite their low public profiles, have been integral to Amazon\u2019s story. Mark Bezos, diverging from the Amazon path, carved out a successful career in advertising and philanthropy, while Christina Bezos has maintained a discreet presence, focusing on family and philanthropic efforts.\nThe Bezos siblings\u2019 journey with Amazon, from a high-risk investment to a billion-dollar return, underscores the power of visionary entrepreneurship and the potential of the digital economy. Their story, intertwined with the rise of one of the world\u2019s most influential companies, highlights the far-reaching impact of strategic risk-taking in the rapidly evolving world of technology and commerce.\nThe story of the Bezos siblings and their investment in Amazon is more than a tale of financial gain; it\u2019s an example of the potential of startups. Their success is a reminder that investing in a startup, while risky, can lead to extraordinary outcomes. It\u2019s about spotting opportunities in visionary ideas and the courage to back them, even when the future seems uncertain.\nImagine being part of something that starts small but grows into a global phenomenon.

        "Author": "  Marco Quiroz-Gutierrez ",
        "Text": "Amazon spends billions of dollars every year on programming for its Prime Video platform, and now it wants customers to pay up or get used to seeing ads on their favorite shows.\nOn Monday, the tech giant made ad-supported streaming the default on Prime Video for its more than 200 million subscribers. The company originally announced the plan in September, saying that \u200b\u200bit was needed, \u201cto continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment.\u201d\nAmazon claimed in its original announcement that Prime Video will show fewer ads than regular TV or other streaming services, but those who want to avoid them altogether will have to pay an additional $2.99 per month on top of the $14.99 monthly fee that already exists.\nThe change comes as the company has increased the amount it spends on content to fill out its Prime offerings. In 2022, the company finalized founder Jeff Bezos's $8.5 billion purchase of MGM, in what was its second-most expensive acquisition at the time. Since then, Amazon has beefed up spending, including a $16 billion splurge on content in 2022, $7 billion of which went to original programming.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, the company\u2019s most recent earnings report, Amazon made just over $10 billion from its subscription services unit, which includes Prime and other non-Amazon Web Services subscription services in digital video, audiobooks, digital music, and e-books. Experts predict that the new changes to Prime Video could provide an added boost.\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley predict that the company\u2019s changes could bring in an extra $3.3 billion in advertising revenue in 2024. Meanwhile, New York\u2013based media investment firm MoffettNathanson had lower predictions but still said Amazon will bring in $1.3 billion from advertisers in 2024 and another $2.3 billion next year.\nThe company is predicting that 159 million of its subscribers will immediately be exposed to ads on the platform, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an internal presentation Amazon made for potential advertisers. That number may be enticing to companies looking to reach more eyeballs, as it beats out the 23 million monthly active users that are exposed to ads on market leader Netflix\u2019s platform.\nStill, Prime customers are mostly unhappy about the change and have taken to social media to complain about the new ads on the platform. Many have chalked up Prime\u2019s ads rollout to corporate greed.\nAlthough customers are not happy with the new change, Wall Street\u2019s push for profitability in streaming has caused companies to adapt their earlier business models. In December 2022, Disney+ introduced an ad-supported tier at the same time that it announced a $3 monthly price hike for its ad-free plan. It then hiked prices another $3 per month in August.\nNetflix, which at 260 million subscribers worldwide has more than double the customers of any other streaming service, cracked down on password sharing, along with debuting its own advertising tier, in a bid to improve profitability. These helped Netflix, which is emerging as the undisputed winner of the streaming wars, crush its last earnings with the biggest boost of new subscribers since the pandemic. Of course, Netflix kicked off streaming's pivot from growth to profitability by reporting a subscriber drop in 2022, contributing to the flood of advertising into streaming, now including Amazon Prime.\nWhile the percentage of U.S. households that subscribe to streaming services had stayed between 80% and 83% each quarter for the past two years, the end of 2023 saw that number jump to 85%, exceeding expectations and spurring hopes that there is still more room to grow in the streaming sector.\nAmazon did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Prime Video is joining most other streaming services by inserting ads into its programming and raising prices on ad-free tiers.\nThat\u2019s because streaming services are no long chasing subscribers, but rather investors are pressuring them to make money off the services, even if it comes at the expense of losing subscriptions. As a result, they are selling ads or hiking monthly prices.\nNetflix in October said its premium ad-free plan in the United States will increase by $3 per month, to $22.99. Its one-stream basic plan rose to $11.99 in the United States; that plan is grandfathered in and is no longer available for new or rejoining members. All other plans, including its entry-level, $6.99-a-month ad-supported tier, remained at the same monthly cost.\nIn August, Disney+ increased prices for the second time in less than a year, with the monthly cost of its ad-free plan rising to $13.99 in October \u2014 a $3 increase. Hulu, in which Disney owns a majority stake, will also hike its monthly ad-free subscription $3 to $17.99.\nMax, owned by CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, raised prices in January 2023 by $1 a month \u2014 its first-ever price hike. And Peacock, owned by NBCUniversal, also had its first-ever price hike in July.\nThe price hikes come as streaming companies search for additional revenue. Consumer demand for streaming services has slowed dramatically since the pandemic, cutting into streamers\u2019 revenue growth.\nMeanwhile, the cost for producing shows has risen, and it will continue to go up as the actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 new negotiated contracts kick in. Raising prices is one way to solve streaming companies\u2019 financial issues.\nWhen Amazon first announced the change in September, it explained that ads will help it continue to produce popular programs, such as \u201cThursday Night Football.\u201d Spending on Amazon\u2019s content, which includes its original series, soared nearly 30% in 2022 to $16.6 billion.\nA recent Morgan Stanley report predicts that ads on Prime Video will generate more than $3 billion in additional revenue this year, soaring up to $7 billion in 2026.\nThe company didn\u2019t reveal how long the ad breaks will be. Prime Video, which is home to the new Nicole Kidman series \u201cExpats\u201d and \u201cCitadel,\u201d is included in the $139 yearly Prime subscription.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Text": "Prologis (NYSE:PLD), with its dividend yield of 2.7%, offers a unique investment opportunity in the real estate sector, focusing on industrial logistics properties. This specialization is particularly timely, tapping into the exponential growth of e-commerce and the consequent demand for distribution centers and warehouses. The surge in online shopping, accelerated by digital transformation and consumer behavior shifts, makes Prologis a strategic choice for investors aiming for consistent, growth-oriented returns.\nAn intriguing aspect of investing in Prologis is the indirect connection it offers to one of the world's largest e-commerce companies, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). While Prologis\u2019 tenants are diverse, Amazon stands out as a notable lessee, making an investment in Prologis an indirect way of tapping into the retail giant's expansive growth. This relationship with Amazon adds a fascinating dimension to Prologis' investment appeal \u2013 it's like earning dividends from Amazon's continued expansion and dominance in the e-commerce sector.\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Dara Khosrowshahi-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\u00a0\nInvestors usually face a trade-off between growth and income; high-growth investments rarely provide regular income, and high-dividend stocks often don't offer substantial growth prospects. Prologis, however, breaks this mold. By investing in the logistics real estate that is fundamental to the operation of e-commerce giants like Amazon, Prologis is firmly positioned in a rapidly growing sector. At the same time, its status as a REIT means it distributes the majority of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.\nPrologis owns and manages a vast array of logistics properties across strategic locations globally, including key urban and suburban areas. This extensive geographical footprint is vital in mitigating risks associated with regional economic variations. The company\u2019s properties, which serve as critical hubs for e-commerce giants and supply chain operators, ensure a strong and diverse tenant base. The increasing reliance on efficient logistics and distribution networks underscores the long-term demand for Prologis\u2019 properties.During the fourth quarter of 2023,\u00a0 Prologis announced a dividend of $0.87 per share. The total dividends paid from January to December 2023 were $3.48.\nInvesting in Prologis offers more than a stake in industrial real estate; it provides a pathway to indirectly benefit from Amazon's success. As e-commerce continues to flourish, driven by consumer preferences and technological advancements, Prologis' role in this ecosystem becomes increasingly vital, potentially enhancing its dividend prospects. This connection offers a compelling reason for investors to consider Prologis as a way to diversify their portfolio and gain exposure to the booming e-commerce sector.\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\u00a0\nCollecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

        "Title": "The founder who launched the \u2018Amazon of Latin America\u2019 from a parking garage has transformed retail in the region\u2014and earned himself $7 billion",
        "Author": "  Leo Schwartz ",
        "Text": "When Marcos Galperin started online marketplace MercadoLibre in a parking garage, he wasn\u2019t trying to evoke the origin stories of U.S. tech companies like Hewlett-Packard and Apple. In Buenos Aires in 1999, the garage of his father\u2019s leather company was just the best option for fast broadband internet. \u201cIt was a building with terrible offices, but at least we had good connectivity,\u201d he says.\nBut like his Big Tech brethren, Galperin spun gold from the dingiest of spaces. Today, Galperin is one of the wealthiest men in Latin America, with an estimated net worth of over $7\u00a0billion thanks to MercadoLibre\u2019s astronomical growth. The company, now based in Uruguay, started as a clone of eBay but today is known as the Amazon of Latin America. The e-commerce site sold over $11\u00a0billion in goods in the third quarter of 2023, a nearly 60% increase year over year.\nMercadoLibre\u2019s marketplace resembles Amazon, selling goods from electronics to supermarket basics with the promise of 24-hour delivery, but it would be a disservice to paint Galperin as a Jeff Bezos imitator. He has combined MercadoLibre\u2019s e-commerce prowess with payment tools to usher regional shopping into the digital age. By adapting to the complex challenges of Latin America and reinventing MercadoLibre over the course of 25 years, Galperin created a tech company with a market cap of nearly $85\u00a0billion, second only to Brazil\u2019s state-owned energy giant Petrobras in Latin America. Its regional dominance has little parallel in the rest of the world.\nAs U.S. and Asian competitors vie for Latin America\u2019s red-hot e-commerce market, and regional politics poses risks to its business, Galperin keeps pushing MercadoLibre into new sectors, from mutual funds to crypto. \u201cWe\u2019re always paranoid,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s game over by any means.\u201d\nGalperin, 52, came of age in an Argentina that bears little resemblance to the country that today is suffering from skyrocketing inflation. The relative stability of the 1990s and his family\u2019s flourishing leather company gave Galperin the opportunity to attend the University of Pennsylvania. He enrolled at Stanford Business School in 1997.\nOver a video call from his office in Uruguay, Galperin, who has salt-and-pepper hair and a quiet affect, recalls how he marveled over the digital advances of U.S. tech companies as a student in Palo Alto. Sites like eBay were converting droves of new online shoppers. Galperin even sold his Volkswagen Golf via an early online classified ad. \u201cI was very enthusiastic about what I thought the internet was going to do to the world,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I was very frustrated because I had to come back to Latin America, and there was nothing.\u201d\nGalperin was convinced that an eBay-type platform would explode in Latin America, where problems with retail ran deeper than a lack of web applications. Brick-and-mortar retail was available only in major urban areas, with more rural regions cut off from shopping. \u201cPeople would rather live in a slum next to a big city than live in better conditions in the countryside,\u201d Galperin says. \u201cSo I was convinced this was going to work really, really well in Latin America.\u201d\n\u201cI was very enthusiastic about what I thought the internet was going to do to the world.\u201d\nBack in Argentina, Galperin and his early team erected makeshift cubicles in the parking garage. From the windowless space they conceived of MercadoLibre. (The building eventually kicked them out for violating safety codes.) Galperin had been inspired by eBay\u2014and in fact, eBay was an early investor in MercadoLibre\u2014but early on he abandoned its auction model; he wanted to build a platform that people came to for everyday shopping, not just the thrill of a ticking clock. MercadoLibre launched its marketplace that connects buyers with third-party sellers in 1999, a year before Amazon.\nMercadoLibre expanded to Brazil and Mexico in its first year. By the time it went public in 2007, it had earned its \u201cAmazon of Latin America\u201d moniker, but its annual revenue remained low, crossing $100\u00a0million in 2008 and $1\u00a0billion in 2017. The pandemic accelerated growth, and revenue topped $10\u00a0billion in 2022.\nGalperin doesn\u2019t mind the association with\u2014or attention from\u2014U.S. counterparts. He claims eBay came close to buying MercadoLibre several times, most recently in the 2010s. (eBay did not return a request for comment.) He says he admires Amazon\u2019s long-term vision, but Galperin set MercadoLibre on a different path as it navigated Latin America\u2019s logistical snarls. \u201cMercadoLibre is not really the copy of Amazon in Latin America,\u201d says Guillermo Ochovo, director at consulting firm Cargo Facts. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing their own thing.\u201d\nWhile Amazon established a second business out of cloud-hosting, MercadoLibre expanded into payments, more out of necessity than diversification. In Mexico, one of MercadoLibre\u2019s main markets, less than 25% of the urban population held a savings account in 2000. Sales that MercadoLibre facilitated between vendors and buyers often took place in person and in cash, with no way for MercadoLibre to verify transactions to earn its cut. \u201cWe were at the mercy of whatever the sellers claimed had happened,\u201d Galperin says.\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nSo in 2003 MercadoLibre launched Mercado Pago, a payments system that let users load their balances with cash. Later it added features like a point-of-sale system and QR code payments that could be used outside its marketplace. Merchants\u2014from storefronts to food stalls\u2014could accept payments via Mercado Pago. The innovations fueled adoption of online financial tools. In the first three quarters of 2023, Mercado Pago reported 167\u00a0million active users and processed over 6.5\u00a0billion transactions.\n\u201cPeople that have traditionally been unbanked are not willing to walk into a bank branch,\u201d says Galperin. \u201cThey feel that it\u2019s not for them and they will be laughed out of the place.\u201d\nIn 2017, the company expanded into the credit business, offering financing to customers and merchants to make purchases, build out their businesses, and even pay taxes. In the third quarter of 2023, fintech accounted for over 43% of MercadoLibre\u2019s revenue of $3.8 billion. \u201cMercadoLibre is really a payments company,\u201d says Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of business intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse.\nMercadoLibre also set itself apart by partnering with local companies to adapt to the logistical challenges of countries in the region. In Brazil, the largest market in Latin America, e-commerce companies struggled with deliveries, since homes there might not have addresses or may be in dangerous areas. Through logistics company Kangu, MercadoLibre connected sellers to local shops that served as delivery points. MercadoLibre acquired Kangu in 2021.\nMercadoLibre has also benefited from \u201cbeing a company of Latin America, from Latin America, and for Latin America,\u201d says Matteo Ceurvels, principal Latin America analyst for eMarketer. MercadoLibre went as far as to change its name in Brazil to MercadoLivre, Portuguese for \u201cfree market.\u201d Amazon, meanwhile, struggled to properly translate its website when it launched there, says Ochovo. (Amazon didn\u2019t return a request for comment.) In 2022, MercadoLibre accounted for 34% of online sales in Brazil\u2014nearly the same share as its two largest competitors combined.\n\u201cMercadoLibre is not really\u00a0the copy of Amazon in\u00a0Latin America. They\u2019ve been doing their own thing.\u201d\nAsian e-commerce companies like Temu, Shein, and Shopee may pose a greater threat to MercadoLibre than Amazon ever did, with their gamified shopping and low-priced inventory. MercadoLibre has responded in a few ways; it launched a short video platform called Clips in 2023 that mirrors its Asian rivals. But so far the new competition hasn\u2019t made much of a dent in MercadoLibre\u2019s business, Ochovo says. The upstarts are still struggling to figure out the particularities of different Latin American markets. After a much-hyped expansion, Shopee closed operations in four countries in 2022.\nFor now, Galperin remains focused on payments. In response to Argentina\u2019s economic turmoil, he wants to create hedges against inflation that reached 185% in 2023. In 2018, MercadoLibre started offering Argentine customers the option to invest in mutual funds. By late last year, 12\u00a0million users\u2014equal to 25% of the nation\u2019s population\u2014used the feature, MercadoLibre says. Starting in 2022, it added a tool to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, including U.S.-dollar-backed stablecoins. (Argentina\u2019s Central Bank banned the feature, but it\u2019s available in other markets.)\nAmong MercadoLibre\u2019s largest markets, Argentina is a distant second to Brazil, but it remains Galperin\u2019s spiritual, if not physical, home. And the country represents how the region\u2019s economic and political uncertainty poses a perpetual threat to its business.\nGalperin has long clashed with Argentina\u2019s presidential administrations and has resided across the La Plata River in Uruguay for years. He returned under center-right Mauricio Macri, but in 2020 resigned as president of MercadoLibre\u2019s Argentina unit after a federal prosecutor accused Galperin and his board of fraud and insider trading. Galperin denied the charges but left the country again. The case has been dropped.\nArgentina stunned the world in November by electing as president the self-proclaimed \u201canarcho-capitalist\u201d Javier Milei, who has vowed to impose a bruising austerity campaign. Galperin is cautiously optimistic about the firebrand: \u201cI\u2019m enthusiastic about the ideas he advocates.\u201d\nGalperin recognizes that Milei\u2019s economic policies are causing the prices of everyday items like diapers and beef to soar. The whiplash is challenging MercadoLibre\u2019s operations, but he says he\u2019s accustomed to volatility. After all, the company has operated in Venezuela since 2005.\nGalperin says that the possibility of punishing days ahead evokes his early vision for MercadoLibre\u2014to serve customers living on informal salaries or without ready access to goods. \u201cWhat we do, at the end of the day, helps the weakest people in Latin America,\u201d he says. \u201cI worry more about the country than I worry about the company.\u201d\nThis article appears in the February/March 2024 issue of Fortune with the headline, \u201cIn focus: Marcos Galperin.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "On the first episode of the fifth season of\u00a0Fortune\u2019s\u00a0Leadership Next\u00a0podcast, co-host Alan Murray sits down with some of the world\u2019s most powerful CEOs for dinner at Davos.\nThe opening interview for the evening was with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. During their conversation, Murray and Jassy talked about 2024\u2019s biggest opportunities and risks. There was one topic that stood out above all others, just as it did for all the other CEOs at the dinner: generative AI. The one question Jassy wouldn\u2019t answer: How his leadership style differs from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\nLeadership Next co-host Michal Lev-Ram joins Murray for the pre-interview chat.\nListen to the episode or read the transcript below.\nAlan Murray: I can't believe this crowd has this much energy this late in the week after a full Davos. [Applause from the crowd.]\u00a0 So, congrats. Yeah. I want to thank all of you for coming to the best dinner in Davos. [More applause.] This has been proven by AI [laughter from crowd]: Best dinner, best people, best conversation. So, I'm really glad that you've given us some of your time.\n[Music.]\nLeadership Next is powered by the folks at Deloitte who, like me, are exploring the changing rules of business leadership and how CEOs are navigating this change.\nWelcome to Leadership Next.\nMichal Lev-Ram: The podcast about the changing rules of business leadership.\nMurray: I'm Alan Murray and\u2026\nLev-Ram: I'm Michal Lev-Ram.\nMurray: Welcome to the fifth season of Leadership Next, Michal. I can't believe we've been doing this for four years and have a fifth to go.\nLev-Ram: We're so old. [Laughter.] That's pretty awesome.\nMurray: We've had a lot of CEOs from a lot of the best-known companies in the world on over the course of those four years. But one thing we have never had, until this episode, is the CEO of Amazon, the number two company on the Fortune 500 list, vying for one of the most valuable companies in the world. Jeff Bezos alluded us, but recently Andy Jassy joined Fortune at our annual CEO dinner in Davos.\nLev-Ram: Speaking of Bezos, by the way, I think he only talks space these days. So, unless we do an episode devoted to that, we're not getting him.\nMurray: I\u2019m in.\nLev-Ram: It would be cool. It would be cool. In your view, what was different about Bezos as a leader and Jassy? And obviously it's a different era now for Amazon.\nMurray: What I've been told and what I've observed is Bezos is famous for his customer obsession. Everything was about the customer. You read the letter that he wrote every year, it\u2019s customer, customer, customer. And I think he reached the point where employees started to feel like they were chopped liver saying, \u201cHey, wait a minute.\u201d Yeah, the customer is important, but what about us? And I do think Jassy has changed the approach a little bit, is perceived as a little more employee friendly, a little more focused on a variety of stakeholders and not relentlessly focused on technology and customers at the cost of everything else. But what was interesting in the interview, I made several attempts to get him to compare himself to his predecessor. He absolutely refused to take the bait. He was not going to play that game no matter how hard I tried.\nLev-Ram: Tell us about Davos. How was it this year? What was different? What stood out?\nMurray: You know, it's such a strange experience because you get this incredible concentration of CEOs and other prominent people. The president of Poland was there, President Zelensky from Ukraine was there, the secretary of state from the U.S., the premier from China, all in this tiny little ski town in Switzerland. And you know, you run into them walking across the street, etc. We, for nine years, have gathered together the CEOs who were in town for a dinner on the Thursday night of the event. Andy Jassy has attended a couple of times in the past. He agreed to come and be the opening interview and then we had table discussions with all of the CEOs where they talked about the same thing that Andy did, which was what are the big opportunities and the big risks that lie ahead in 2024? And what you're going to hear is that number one on that list and probably number two, number three and number four on that list is AI.\nLev-Ram: Well, I know he also brought up beef tournedos. Can you explain what that is?\nMurray: There was a menu on the seats in front of us and he saw beef tournedos and was trying to figure out what that meant. Thought it must be beef twisted like a tornado here. I'm Googling it right now. It's just pan-seared beef.\nLev-Ram: Okay. I thought it\u2026\nMurray: \u2026dressed in a red wine mushroom sauce.\nLev-Ram: So your challenge now is\u2026\nMurray: I don't know.\nLev-Ram: So your challenge now is to work this into some kind of metaphor for the economy. The economy is in a beef tournedo. You know, it's interesting, Amazon, obviously, I mean, we think of it as the everything store. It's the everything company, right? It is just mind boggling how much we interact with Amazon and its various brands.\nMurray: He talked about that. He talked about different tentacles. He talked about what they're doing in medicine. You know, they bought a company called One Medical. I think any company that wants to try and transform medicine in the United States deserves our support.\nLev-Ram: Good luck to them.\nMurray: It's a massive company that touches our lives in so many ways, which is why this interview was so much fun. I'm really, really sorry you weren't there, Michal. But let's dive in and remind everyone that this is in a tight room in a tiny little ski village in the Swiss Alps with about 80 CEOs of big global companies. So it's a different context than our normal Leadership Next.\n[Music.]\nAndy Jassy, why don't you come up here and join me? [Applause.] I think he needs no introduction. You guys have heard of Amazon. One-and-a-half million people, one-and-a-half trillion dollars in market cap. But I learned something really interesting tonight for the first time\u2014that you almost came to work for Fortune. You want to you want to share that story?\nAndy Jassy: Well, I had. First of all, it's great to be here with all of you. I was telling Alan that I thought you were going to talk about the beef tournedos. I was hoping\u2026\nMurray: We will get to that.\nJassy: In between my first job and going to graduate school, when I was applying, I had this recruiter call me about Fortune magazine, and I had a lot of friends I'd worked with before who were there. I had a lot of respect for Time Inc. I got the offer, and I almost did the job instead of going to business school, and then I decided to go to graduate school.\nMurray: It's like Fortune, Amazon, Fortune, Amazon.\nJassy: It was business school.\nMurray: You made a good decision.\nJassy: It was just luck. Total luck.\nMurray: You got it right. I want to start by asking you the question that everybody in this room is going to be asked to address tonight, because this is where we really get value out of this dinner. Look at the year ahead. What do you see as the single biggest opportunity facing business and the single biggest risk facing business?\nJassy: Well, of course, everything we think we know today may be different three months from now. So take this with a grain of salt. I would say that to me, I think the opportunity and risk is pretty similar in that there is this wildly transformative, disruptive technology in generative AI, that you can't get through any conversation without talking about. And I think people, as they, you know, people were on this march pre-pandemic to modernize their technology. You know, it's just part of, you know, I used to manage this business, this AWS business, our cloud computing business. And people were on this march to modernize their technology, to be able to have a lower cost structure, and have better developer productivity, and innovate at a faster clip. And then the pandemic happened. And then we had this economy where everyone, you know, most enterprises tried to figure out how they could save money in any way they could, ours included. And a lot of the low-hanging fruit and cost optimization has attenuated over the last several months, and we're back to starting to invest. I just see companies really battling with the prioritization between are they better off continuing with that modernization of their technology platform or should they spend all their new engineering resources on generative AI?\nIn my opinion, you have to think, again, it's prioritization. Everyone will decide differently. I think you have to think about it in a balanced way because, to me, if you don't set, basically, if you don't have your technology infrastructure foundation right, you are going to have a hard time being successful with generative AI. And actually it's such a sure win to be able to modernize your technology and move to the cloud that, to me, it has a very predictable payback. And yet at the same time, I think you would be foolish not to figure out how to use generative AI successfully. I think everyone is trying to figure out how to be successful in a cost effective and higher ROI way. And so I think that, to me, a lot of companies will end up deciding to take the sure successful win of modernizing their technology platform and setting their foundation right, and then picking at least one or two generative AI initiatives where they can learn how to run it. They can learn how to be successful, they can figure out what you got to do to get the right ROI and right customer experience for your business. But it's got to be a balance, in my opinion.\nMurray: Do you think Davos has overdone the AI thing a bit?\nJassy: I mean, I don't think Davos is unique to that. Yeah, I think it is so exciting. It's really, it has the chance to transform virtually every customer experience. I mean, we're building 60-ish applications right now.\nMurray: Yeah, yeah. Let me ask you about that because, yes, every conversation for the last four days has been about AI and particularly generative AI. But when you talk to people about it, they generally talk about Open AI and Microsoft. Maybe they talk about Google, maybe they bring in Meta, but they don't talk about Amazon. I mean, do you feel like you have missed, been behind the braid a little bit on this or what? Why are we not hearing Amazon in the same sense?\nJassy: I don't. Know who you're talking to Alan. [Laughter from crowd.] Not our customers.\nBut, you know, I think that most of the conversation, in my opinion, on generative AI so far has really been at the application layer. So, things like ChatGPT, which is by the way, a really remarkable application. But the way that we think about AI is it has three layers of the stack, and all three are massive, and we're investing very heavily in all three. But you know, at the bottom layer, if you're going to build your own large language models, you're going to have to train the models. And the key to training is compute, and the key to compute is the chip in the compute, and today there's really been one GPU chip provider, and many of you probably know it's hard to get capacity right now. And people are wondering, you know, what the cost structure is really going to be like.\nAnd so, you know, about five years ago we invested in building our own custom AI chips, and we have a chip that we've built for training called Training, and one that we built for inference called Inferential. And we're on the second version of those chips, and they're going to be meaningfully more price performant than what you see elsewhere. And so, you know, when you get into, I think customers who build models are starting to figure out the cost equation is maybe a little bit different than they thought. And then the dirty little secret\u2014if you have generative AI apps in production at scale like we do in a bunch of areas like Alexa\u2014is that almost all the cost ends up being in the inference. You know, you train, take Alexa, you train periodically, but we have billions of predictions or inferences coming, you know, every day. And so people are going to really care about that price performance. So that bottom layer is an area I think people are going to care about.\nAnd then at that middle layer, it's really for companies that don't want to build their own large language models. They want to use somebody else's and customize it with their own data. And, you know, we built a service called Bedrock there that does just that. It basically takes our own large language models, and then Anthropic\u2019s and Meta\u2019s with Llama 2 and Cohere and Stability AI. And you know, it takes whatever hard language models you think you want to use, you can customize it with your own data, not leak it back into the general model, and they have the same security and access control and features that you run in the platform. And that also, like, what you're learning, when you actually talk to companies or if you have your own experience building generative AI apps, you realize that it's not going to be one model to rule the world. It\u2019s going to be lots of different models that are better at different things. And then, you know, to try to get the quality that you need for your customers and your reputation at the cost structure and the latency you need for the customer experience, it's actually not simple. And so one of the attractive parts of something like Bedrock is you can move between models and between sizes and models to experiment and find the right experience.\nAnd, you know, and then there's that top layer which are the applications. And you know, there's, there's ChatGPT. But I think another really compelling application in the early days is the Coding Companion. And, you know, we launched a single months ago called Queue that writes code for you, it debugs the code and tests the code, it does transformations in both versions of Java to the new versions, and it looks at your data repositories and lets you answer questions. So all three layers of those stacks. Now that stack is important, and we're making big investments in all those areas, and I think it's still quite early days, but\u2026\nMurray: But you feel comfortable with where you are now?\nJassy: It is so early. This is like three steps into a marathon, but our customers really like what we're building.\nMurray: Well let me ask you, in my house and many of our houses, the first time we started talking to the furniture was Alexa, as you mentioned. So how does Alexa fit in to this process?\nJassy: Yeah, well, you know, Alexa, like a number of different areas inside our company, is one of the many businesses that is building a significant large language model. And, you know, Alexa as you know, you've used Alexa for lots of different things, but we're building a much more expansive, large language model that is aimed to fulfill our broader vision, which has always been the vision for Alexa, which is to be, you know, the world's best personal assistant.\n[Music starts.]\nMurray: \u00a0I\u2019m here with Jason Girzadas, the CEO of Deloitte U.S., the sponsor of this podcast. Thanks for sponsoring and thanks for joining me, Jason.\nJason Girzadas: It's a pleasure to be with you, Alan, and our privilege to sponsor this important podcast.\nMurray: It's great to have you. This whole notion of generative AI is really exploded onto the scene and into our consciousness in the last year. It's the fastest introduction of a new technology in history. How do business leaders deal with that and how do they separate the hype from the opportunity?\nGirzadas: It's a great question, Alan. The hype is real, but we also think the opportunity is more real and in fact an imperative for all businesses. The opportunity right now for businesses is around taking advantage of generative AI and other digital technologies for efficiency and productivity gains, with the belief they will continue to evolve and mature, such that there's other opportunities for value creation and that new disruptions and innovations that we haven't even seen the possibilities of. The challenge just to balance this opportunity. As a result, businesses have to diversify their approaches. It's a CEO level priority, but an understanding of where and how these models are being put to use in your business operations. What are the controls put around data and data quality, as well as ensuring that the models are tested and actually validated like you would do any other customer facing or highly sensitive system in an enterprise environment.\nMurray: Jason, thanks for your perspective and thanks for sponsoring Leadership Next.\nGirzadas: Thank you.\n[Music ends.]\nMurray: So, I want to talk to\u2026you've been in this job for two years now, right?\nJassy: Two and a half.\nMurray: Two and a half. Okay. So you've learned a lot. You've experienced a lot. How would you say your leadership style is different than your predecessor?\nYou can do this, Andy. Come on.\nJassy: Well, I mean, you know, it's a trick question, but then, you know, look, I grew up at Amazon. You know, I've been in Amazon for 26-and-a-half years, and I've done so many different jobs there, and I've been lucky enough to work closely with Jeff. I worked directly for Jeff for 20 years. So, you know, I feel like I learned from somebody who's arguably the most unusual business leader of our era. So, you know, I'm lucky that way. But I do think that every era of business leadership, I think everybody knows this in this room is different. When I started the job, nobody really predicted that the pandemic would last that long, and Omicron would come, and the war in Ukraine would come, and the inflation. I mean, you know, there's lots of things that happened throughout, and you have to just keep adjusting. And that's what we tried to do as a team.\nMurray: But when you now, you have two and a half years to look back, how is it different? Granted, anybody in the job would have changed. But how do you think the leadership at Amazon is different than it\u2026?\nJassy: Well, I don't, you know, we have a very, yeah, we have a set of leadership principles, there are 16 leadership principles that we, you know, carefully crafted and recrafted over the years. I think the leadership principles are quite consistent. I think the leaders are very consistent culturally. It's just we have different, we have some different folks leading the businesses at this point.\nMurray: Yeah, I could keep trying, but you probably don't want me to.\n[Laughter from audience.]\nJassy: You have to decide how long you want to go on.\n[More laughter.]\nMurray: Okay, let's see. Where can we go from there? One of the things that has come up in a number of conversations over the course of the last week is with everyone imagining these incredible options for using AI, there is a question about where does the compute power and where does the electricity come from to run all these massive applications? Amazon has been early and strong on sustainability, but how does this explosion in interest in complicated, massive compute power make you think about sustainability?\nJassy: Well, you know, I think we all I've been in the Fortune dinner business, maybe my third or fourth year, and we always talk about how important the environment is and how critical it is. And like a lot of you know, we have this thing called the Climate Pledge where we've, you know, pledged to be carbon zero by 2040. And for a company like ours, it's different than most technology companies. We're already well over 90% renewable energy now. We\u2019ll be 100% in 2025. But to get all the way there, when you have to ship as many products as we do with as many trucks and you know, the packaging and all the buildings, it's quite difficult.\nAnd I think it's interesting what's happened with power. I think that a lot of the municipalities around the world underestimated how much power was required. In fact, several of them told us they just took our estimates and cut them by a third. They just didn't believe them. And that was during the pandemic and that was before, you know, generative AI came about. You know, generative AI and these large language models are so power hungry that it's been an explosion in demand, and there's not enough energy right now. And so, we're going to have the dual challenge as a group to find a lot more energy to satisfy what people want to do and what we can get done for society with generative AI. But we've got to do it in a renewable way, in a carbon neutral or zero way. It can't be going back to coal. So that that will require a lot of development, and we\u2019ll have to be part of that.\nMurray: So what's the next big thing to come from Amazon? I mean, is it health? You made this investment in One Medical. What's the thing that excites you that could be a fourth pillar for Amazon?\nJassy: Well, there are so many things that I'm excited about. This is a hard, this is not a soup question. You know, I think that I'm very bullish on what we're doing with Prime Video. You know, I think the combination of the customer experience, the content we build ourselves, you know, the sports that we have and then all of our third-party media partners who are part of our channels program, we're trying to build the place as the best selection of streaming video. And I think that customers, you know, the growth that we've had there, the growth in engagement, the growth in customers, the marketplace, I\u2019m very bullish about that business and how it's progressing. I also think, you know, there's still 400 to 500 million households around the world that don't have broadband connectivity. And so they can't do the things we take for granted. They can't do education online. They can't do their jobs online. They can't watch entertainment, they can't buy. And so we're pursuing this Earth orbit satellite that we call Kuiper that we think will have a real meaningful impact on a lot of people around the world, particularly in rural areas that I also think will be\u2026 it's a big capital investment, but I think it will help a lot of people and it will be a good business as well.\nMurray: When will you start to roll that out?\nJassy: We'll start to roll it out this year. You know, we did our first two big end-to-end test satellites in October that really performed very well. So there's a lot of demand for that. There's demand on the government and the enterprise side, and consumers are excited about it too.\nMurray: Health care? There are a lot of people curious about where you're going in health care.\nJassy: You know, I feel like when my parents tell me that they didn't have color TV, you know, I just kind of roll my eyes. Like my kids, you know, roll their eyes when I said we didn't have the internet when I was growing up or mobile phones. But I think that my kids\u2019 kids will not believe what the health care experience was for us. Like the fact that if you want to go see a doctor, you got to make an appointment three or four weeks out, you got to drive 20 minutes and park. You have to wait in the waiting room for 15 minutes. Then they put you in an exam room. You go, wait 10 minutes for the doctor. Doctor sees you for 10 minutes and you drive 20 minutes to the pharmacy, I mean, that experience is just kind of nutty. And that that will completely go away with the way the future of health care is. And so One Medical is a different way of doing primary care. It has an amazing digital interface. You can chat with doctors, you can do video conferences, you can make appointments same day or next day. You can get into specialists same day or next day. All the reservations are integrated. And then if you whatever pharmaceutical needs you have, they're connected to Amazon Pharmacy and to a bunch of others that you just get sent to your house within a day. So it's a very different experience and, you know, pharmacy for us was not a big extension. We've been asked by customers for so long to do that, and that business has grown really quickly, and I think will be big as well. But we're really trying to get at changing the core health care experience, starting in the U.S., which I think has not been a happy place for a lot of people.\nMurray: We're just about out of time here. But you've got this massive antitrust case against you from the FTC. I mean, anything to that.\n[Jassy laughs.]\nI'm trying to make it easy for you.\nJassy: Well, what I would say to that is I am aware of it and\u2026\n[Laughter from crowd.]\nMurray: I\u2019ll ask you another question. Have you watched the video of Bill Gates being deposed in the 1990s in his antitrust case?\nJassy: No, I haven't.\nMurray: You haven't? You should.\nJassy: Okay.\nMurray: Yeah, I would strongly recommend you do.\nJassy: You know, I think all I can say about that is I think that I think they're wrong on the facts and the law. I think that will be borne out over time. How they go in general, we need to be careful in in Western countries not to kill innovation and not, you know, there's a lot of consolidate in various industries, and if we only, you know, have strong regulations in Western countries, you'll leave the playing field open in other spots you don't mean to.\nMurray: Is there anything that I haven't asked you that I should have?\nJassy: Not that I'm aware of.\nMurray: Good.\nJassy: If I knew what beef tournedos\u2026.\nMurray: You're going to find out in just a minute. Go ahead. Take your seat. Thank you for doing this.

        "Author": "  Allie Garfinkle ",
        "Text": "When Amazon called off its acquisition of iRobot on Monday, the impact was immediate: The Roomba maker\u2019s longtime cofounder and CEO stepped aside and hundreds of staffers were laid off.\nBut, coming on the heels of Adobe's abandoned $20 billion Figma buyout last year in the face of regulatory pushback, a longer-term and more unsettling air is sending shudders through the startup world and raising anxiety about the exit environment for a certain class of company.\nIn this antitrust-fueled climate change, being a unicorn isn\u2019t easy.\n\"If you're under a billion dollars, you're actually looking a lot better right now than if you're a unicorn trying to make an exit,\u201d said Cathay Innovation partner Simon Wu.\nThe glorious corporate exit for a mature startup is looking increasingly difficult, drawing attention to another tricky option\u2014IPOs, which companies will be under even more pressure to undertake due to regulatory standstills, said Bhaskar Chakravorti, Tufts\u2019 Dean of Global Business.\nIt isn\u2019t just unicorns that are affected by these stumped deals, which \u201csend waves through the ecosystem around questioning what exit paths can exist,\u201d said Pari Passu Venture Partners managing partner Julia Krieger. Losing M&A as a viable exit for late-stage startups of all kinds could cause \u201csubstantial damage to the venture ecosystem,\u201d said angel investor Adam Nash, an early Figma backer and current CEO-cofounder of Daffy.\nSome have even harsher words.

The deal was initially announced in August 2022, and the price last year dropped from the initial $1.7 billion. At the time, the explanation was tied to debt that iRobot was taking on. For Paolo Pirjanian, the former iRobot CTO who is now the founder of robotics startup Embodied, the trouble at his former company is really a sign of floundering innovation efforts.\n\u201ciRobot has been losing market share, it\u2019s a falling knife,\u201d he said. \u201cI can imagine if I was sitting in Amazon's shoes, I\u2019d say this deal isn\u2019t worth it to me anymore.\"\nFor my part, I\u2019ve begun imagining private markets right now as a bathtub, with water sitting in it yet to be drained. I ran the image by Mark Patricof, founder of athlete-focused investment firm Patricof Co, who digs it.\n\"You're going to need to see some rationalization around exits.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- There are two ways to look at the collapse of Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s deal to buy iRobot Corp., which makes Roomba vacuum cleaners. The one that led the companies\u2019 joint statement Monday cited \u201cno path to regulatory approval in the European Union.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nDonald Trump Loses London Case Against Ex-MI6 Spy Over Kremlin Dossier\nA $560 Billion Property Warning Hits Banks From NY to Tokyo\nQQQ Up in Late Trading as Meta Soars, Apple Falls: Markets Wrap\nApple\u2019s China Slump Deepens Even as Total Sales Grow Again\nLewis Hamilton to Join Ferrari F1 Team in 2025, Leaving Mercedes\nBut there\u2019s another potential explanation: buyer\u2019s remorse.\nIn the 17 months since Amazon agreed to the deal, iRobot\u2019s business has faltered. Faced with the choice of going to war with regulators \u2014 potentially in a years-long quagmire on both sides of the Atlantic \u2014 or cutting its losses, Amazon chose to bail.\nFrom its home base in Bedford, Massachusetts, iRobot has long punched above its weight. The Roomba has been so successful that it defined its own product category.\nWhat competitors lacked in brand recognition, though, they made up for in low prices and shipping volume. The robot vacuum market now has \u201can unprecedented number of players,\u201d according to Parks Associates, which tracks smart home devices. That includes a multitude of startups, South Korean and Chinese electronics giants and stalwart vacuum brands like Bissell and Dyson.\nIn a survey of US households with home internet that Parks Associates conducted in early 2019, 63% of respondents who owned a robot vacuum reported having a Roomba. By the end of last year, that share was down to 48%.\nIRobot has blamed \u201cincreased pricing competition\u201d for dragging on sales. It held layoffs in 2022 and 2023, subleased part of its headquarters and scaled back advertising and research and development. The company has incurred about $500 million in losses since 2021.\nWhen Amazon called off its $1.4 billion purchase on Monday, iRobot announced yet another round of cuts, totaling 31% of its workforce, and the departure of its chief executive officer.\nSpokespeople for Amazon and IRobot declined to comment beyond their public statements. In one of them, David Zapolsky, Amazon\u2019s general counsel, said the termination of the deal will \u201cdeny consumers faster innovation and more competitive prices, which we\u2019re confident would have made their lives easier and more enjoyable.\u201d\nAmazon's top lawyer also suggested the regulatory scrutiny from Washington and Brussels would prove self-defeating: \u201cMergers and acquisitions like this help companies like iRobot better compete in the global marketplace, particularly against companies, and from countries, that aren\u2019t subject to the same regulatory requirements in fast-moving technology segments like robotics.\u201d\nThe retreat is something of a new look for Amazon, which has defended itself against past charges of anticompetitive practices, betting its moves would stand up in court if it came to it. Amazon faced down skeptical regulators during its recent purchases of MGM and One Medical. With iRobot, Amazon didn\u2019t even offer European regulators a compromise, or what\u2019s known in regulatory negotiations as a merger remedy.\nThe financial impact to Amazon of walking away will be minimal: a $94 million breakup fee, which iRobot will use to pay down debt and compensate its financial advisers. For Amazon, which has $64 billion in cash, it\u2019s like a restocking fee.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nA Brutal Crime Crackdown Is Emboldening Leaders Across Latin America\nElon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday\nChinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters\nAI Is Helping Pick What You\u2019ll Wear in Two Years\nAI Can Speed Drug Discovery.

        "Title": "Could Twilio Become the Next Amazon?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Twilio (NYSE: TWLO) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) can be considered the David and Goliath, respectively, of the cloud services market. Twilio's cloud platform processes text messages, voice calls, and videos for mobile apps. Instead of building those features from scratch, developers can outsource those features to Twilio with a few lines of code.\nAmazon's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the world's largest cloud infrastructure platform. Its customers can rent computing power and storage from its platform instead of buying lots of servers or building their own data centers. AWS also integrates other data processing and development tools into its platform.\nTwilio was notably co-founded by Jeff Lawson, who helped develop the technology that would eventually evolve into AWS during his time as a technical product manager at Amazon. During his time at Amazon, Lawson recognized the growth potential of dedicated cloud services for mobile apps -- and that idea became the basis for creating Twilio.\nTwilio is still a baby compared to Amazon, but could it grow into a cloud titan over the next few decades? Let's look back at its post-IPO trials and tribulations to find out.\nTwilio went public at $15 per share on June 23, 2016, and it closed at its all-time high of $443.49 on Feb. 18, 2021. At its peak, its enterprise value reached $70 billion -- or 25 times the revenue it would go on to generate in 2021.\nAt the time, investors were dazzled by Twilio's explosive growth rates. From 2015 to 2021, its revenue soared at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 60% from $167 million to $1.76 billion. That feverish growth was largely driven by the increased integration of voice calls and text messages into mobile apps, but it was also fueled by its acquisitions of smaller companies like Beepsend and Segment.\nToday, Twilio's stock trades at about $72 with an enterprise value of $10 billion -- which is just over 2 times the sales it's expected to generate in 2024. Twilio's stock tumbled as its revenue growth cooled off, its gross margin shrank, and rising interest rates compressed its valuations. It also failed to achieve its own ambitious long-term growth targets.\nDuring its investor day presentation in October 2020, Twilio claimed it could grow its organic revenue by at least 30% annually through 2024. Its revenue actually increased 42% organically (and 61% as reported) in 2021, but rose just 30% organically (and 35% as reported) to $3.8 billion in 2022. It eventually abandoned its 30% growth target last year, and analysts expect its reported revenue to only rise 8% in both 2023 and 2024.\nBy comparison, AWS' sales rose 29% to $80.1 billion in 2022 and 13% year over year to $66.6 billion in the first nine months of 2023. It's generally a bright red flag when an underdog is growing at a much slower rate than the market leader.\nTwilio's growth slowed down as the macro headwinds forced companies to rein in their spending on cloud services. It also faced fierce competition from similar services like MessageBird, Bandwidth, and Ericsson's Vonage.\nTo make matters worse, it's generally difficult for Twilio to lock in its customers because it only charges usage-based fees -- which are paid whenever its service is accessed -- instead of selling stickier subscription plans. Meanwhile, its margins are being squeezed by rising carrier fees, which telecom companies now charge third-party apps to access their networks.\nTwilio also runs its services on AWS' backbone instead of its own cloud infrastructure platform. Therefore, it probably won't evolve into a cloud giant like AWS without spending billions of dollars to build its own cloud infrastructure.\nAs Twilio's growth cooled off, it authorized a $1 billion buyback plan last February -- which was a troubling move because it strongly suggested it was running out of fresh ways to expand its business. It was also an odd decision to plow so much cash into buybacks when the company remains deeply unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis. To top it all off, Twilio's recent layoffs, intense pressure from activist investors, and Lawson's recent resignation from the CEO position all strongly indicate the company could struggle to grow over the next few years.\nTwilio's early mover's advantage gave it a promising start in the cloud communications space, but I'm not convinced it can expand beyond its saturated niche. AWS was able to scale up its operations over the next two decades because it was funded by Amazon's larger e-commerce business, but Twilio needs to grow up on its own. Twilio's business might stabilize over the next few years, but investors looking for the \"next Amazon\" should check out other growing cloud-based companies instead.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Twilio right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Twilio, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Twilio wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "Could MercadoLibre Be the Next Amazon?",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are two of the best-performing stocks of the last decade.\nBoth have benefited from strong tailwinds in e-commerce to dominate their respective geographies. For MercadoLibre that's Latin America, and for Amazon its North America and Europe. The chart below shows how the two stocks have performed over the last decade.\nAs you can see, both stocks have trounced the S&P 500 since 2014. They've beaten the market by an even wider margin over their complete histories.\nMercadoLibre and Amazon have found success on the stock market by following similar playbooks.\nMercadoLibre was founded in 1999, just a few years after Amazon, and founder Marcos Galperin saw an opportunity for e-commerce in Latin America. Galperin was particularly impressed by eBay, which was an important early competitor to Amazon in e-commerce at the time, and believed there was an opening for a similar company south of the U.S.\nLike Amazon, MercadoLibre grew quickly from the start, gaining 15,000 users in its first three months, which came during the peak of the dot-com boom.\nA key acquisition of a company owned by eBay in 2001 gave MercadoLibre a boost. As part of the deal, eBay took a stake in the budding Latin American e-commerce company. It also agreed to share best practices with MercadoLibre, as well as vowing not to compete in Latin America itself for five years.\nAmazon rapidly expanded from a direct online retailer by adding a third-party marketplace and expanded into new product categories. MercadoLibre made a similar move that changed the trajectory of the business.\nThe company added Mercado Pago, its fintech solution, in 2003, seeing a need among Latin America's large unbanked population. Mercado Pago reached $90 million in gross merchandise volume, or 8% of its total, in 2006, and the Latin American company began to layer more products onto its e-commerce business.\nUnlike Amazon, MercadoLibre started as a third-party marketplace and later added its first-party e-commerce business. However, each company recognized the advantage of owning its own logistics and delivery service, which was called Mercado Envios at MercadoLibre. That move has given both companies a competitive advantage, lowering delivery costs and improving delivery speeds.\nThe Latin American company even has a loyalty program called Meli+ that's similar to Amazon Prime, and MercadoLibre has also launched advertising, a business that is now driving more than $40 billion in revenue annually at Amazon.\nThough Amazon might be best known for its e-commerce business, most of the company's profit comes from its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, and MercadoLibre is unlikely to get into cloud infrastructure.\nHowever, MercadoLibre doesn't need to do that, as the company is successfully ramping up profit margins and seeing strong revenue growth from its e-commerce and fintech businesses. Similarly, Amazon lacks the kind of juggernaut fintech business that Mercado Pago has become for MercadoLibre.\nNo other company has succeeded with the Amazon playbook more than MercadoLibre, as the combination of interconnected e-commerce-related businesses creates barriers to entry and competitive advantages, locking customers in and driving profits through ancillary revenue streams like advertising.\nMeanwhile, MercadoLibre's growth has helped block out competition, including from Amazon and Sea Limited's Shopee.\nMercadoLibre, which currently trades at a market cap of $88 billion, is unlikely to ever approach Amazon's market value, which is now well over $1 trillion. However, MercadoLibre is growing significantly faster than Amazon, and looks likely to maintain that momentum, as it's at an earlier stage of its growth than Amazon.\nGiven its recent track record of outperformance against Amazon, MercadoLibre looks likely to continue to deliver outstanding returns as it follows in Amazon's footsteps.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and MercadoLibre made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks\n\u00a0\n*Stock Advisor returns as of January 22, 2024\n\u00a0\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "Author": "  Cecilia D'Anastasio ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s livestreaming site Twitch is cutting 35% of its staff, or about 500 workers, Twitch chief executive officer Dan Clancy said in a blog post Wednesday morning. The layoffs are the latest in a series of job reductions there.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Scores Easy Win in Iowa With DeSantis a Distant Second\nUS Merchant Vessel Struck as Shippers Told to Avoid Red Sea\nWhat Is Disease X? How Scientists Are Preparing for the Next Pandemic\nApple to Pull Blood-Oxygen Tool From Watches to Avoid US Ban If Appeal Fails\nChina Banks Tighten Curbs on Russia After US Sanctions Order\nThe cuts, which Bloomberg News earlier reported on Tuesday, come amid concerns over losses at Twitch and after several top executives left the company in the span of a few months.\n\u201cOver the last year, we\u2019ve been working to build a more sustainable business so that Twitch will be here for the long run and throughout the year we have cut costs and made many decisions to be more efficient,\u201d Clancy wrote in the blog post. \u201cUnfortunately, despite these efforts, it has become clear that our organization is still meaningfully larger than it needs to be given the size of our business.\u201d\nRunning a large-scale website supporting 1.8 billion hours of live video content a month is enormously expensive, despite Twitch\u2019s reliance on Amazon\u2019s infrastructure, company executives have said.\nThe business also remains unprofitable more than nine years after Amazon\u2019s acquisition of the company, according to people familiar with the company\u2019s finances who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Twitch has increased its focus on advertising in recent years, and has worked to dramatically cut expenditures. In December, Clancy said the company would cease operations in South Korea, where costs were \u201cprohibitively expensive.\u201d\n\u201cThis decision, while incredibly difficult and painful, is necessary to ensure that we can continue to serve our streamers sustainably without impacting their ability to support their careers on Twitch,\u201d Clancy said in the blog post Wednesday. He added that Twitch had paid out more than $1 billion to streamers in 2023.\nIn the final months of 2023, several top executives announced their departures, including Twitch\u2019s chief product officer, chief customer officer and chief content officer. Twitch also lost its chief revenue officer, who worked on Twitch from within Amazon\u2019s Ads unit. The former executives all declined to comment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always bittersweet when talented leaders move on to pursue new opportunities,\u2019\u2019 a Twitch spokesperson said at the time. \u201cWe are incredibly grateful for their contributions to Twitch and our community, and wish them all the best.\u201d\nSince he took the position in March 2023, Clancy has been on a cross-country charm offensive to mend relations with the gaming celebrities who make a living streaming on Twitch. Many of them chafed at Twitch\u2019s original approach to ads, which the company reworked after criticism. Streamers have praised Clancy\u2019s desire to listen to their concerns after years of complaints that the service was out of touch with its users.\nThe new chief has struggled to stem losses, however. Twitch undertook two rounds of layoffs last year, cutting over 400 positions, part of wider job reductions at Amazon. Like other tech companies, Clancy said, Twitch's reduced size is based on the business\u2019s scale right now and \"conservative predictions of how we expect to grow in the future.\"\nAmazon initiated its biggest-ever corporate job cuts in 2022, which it expanded to 27,000 positions across the company. It continued in October with a new round of cuts to its music division, which encompasses the company\u2019s audio streaming platform and digital storefront for songs.\n(Updates with company comments beginning in first paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nChinese Tycoon on the Rebound After $10 Billion Debt Deal\nHow AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerberg\u2019s Top Priority\nTrumponomics 2.0: What to Expect If Trump Wins the 2024 Election\nFive ETFs to Watch in 2024\nKim Kardashian\u2019s Skims Isn\u2019t the Only Celebrity Brand to Watch\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  John Romano, Tampa Bay Times ",
        "Text": "ST. PETERSBURG \u2014 Bally\u2019s financial issues soon may lead to more viewing options for Rays and Lightning fans.\nDiamond Sports Group, which includes Bally Sports Florida and Bally Sports Sun and which filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy last year, has sold a reported $100 million stake in the company to Amazon, which is expected to make live games available on its Prime streaming service.\nThere were not a lot of details provided on Wednesday, and the agreement must be approved by a bankruptcy court, but it appears the Rays could be among the first teams to take advantage of Prime\u2019s interest in sports programming.\nThe Rays \u2014 along with the Marlins, Brewers, Royals and Tigers \u2014 included streaming rights in their latest deal with Bally. For that reason, those five teams were part of Bally\u2019s soft launch of its streaming app last summer and apparently will be among the first teams to debut on Prime.\nWhile that might be good news for fans who have cut the cord on cable television, the economics of the plan are still to be determined. Amazon Prime sells for $139 a year, or $14.99 per month, but it\u2019s not known if there will be additional fees for sports programming. The Bally app is $19.99 per month, but the company has not said whether that will also give viewers access to watch games on Prime.\nSpectrum customers currently can access the Bally app, but it\u2019s not known whether that will also extend to Prime. To those, and many other questions, Bally essentially has asked fans to stay tuned.\n\u201cPrime Video will become Diamond\u2019s primary partner through which customers will be able to purchase direct-to-consumer access to stream local Diamond channels,\u201d a Diamond press release said. \u201cCustomers will be able to access all local (direct-to-consumer) content, including live MLB, NBA and NHL games, and pre- and postgame programming, for the teams for which Diamond retains (streaming) rights.\u201d\nBally also has streaming rights for the Lightning, but as part of last year\u2019s bankruptcy-related negotiations that deal is set to expire after this season. With the season entering its final months, there may not be enough time to get approval from a bankruptcy judge to make 2023-24 games available on Prime. Bally, Amazon and NHL teams such as the Lightning presumably will be able to negotiate new deals for next season.\nDiamond currently has contracts with 37 teams across the NHL, MLB and NBA. MLB took over the broadcasts of Diamondbacks and Padres games last year after Bally affiliates failed to make rights payments.\nThe agreement with Amazon, which could include an additional $50 million investment, should allow Diamond to pay off some of its creditors and avoid total liquidation. Parent company Sinclair will also provide close to $400 million in financing.\nInformation from other news organizations was used in this report.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

The US Federal Trade Commission said Thursday that the three tech companies must provide information to the agency on their investments and partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic. The FTC said it sent subpoenas to the companies to gather information on how the development of AI is impacting the competitive landscape.\nMore than any other company, Microsoft represents the unique relationship between Big Tech and AI startups. Microsoft committed to invest $13 billion in OpenAI, integrated the AI company\u2019s technology into virtually every corner of its business and played a key role in negotiating for Sam Altman to return as chief executive officer of OpenAI after he was ousted by the board. One of Microsoft\u2019s executives recently joined OpenAI\u2019s board as a nonvoting observer.\nIn the wake of Microsoft\u2019s investment in OpenAI last January, other tech giants raced to partner with leading AI startups through funding and cloud computing deals, too. Salesforce Inc. led a round in Hugging Face at a $4.5 billion valuation. Alphabet and Amazon.com invested billions in OpenAI rival Anthropic. And Nvidia Corp. seemed to back almost every AI startup of note.\nFor AI companies, these deals with Big Tech can serve as a vital lifeline. It\u2019s extremely costly and computationally intensive to build large language models, the technology that underpins AI chatbots like ChatGPT. The tech giants are among the only companies with the infrastructure and funds to support these efforts.\nThat dynamic is now drawing the attention of regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI is facing fresh scrutiny from UK and US competition regulators. In the US, the FTC had previously been tasked by the Biden administration with promoting \u201ca fair, open, and competitive AI ecosystem.\u201d\nIn comments during a public workshop Thursday, FTC Chair Lina Khan said the agency is closely monitoring the industry and warned that AI companies \u201ccannot use claims of innovation as cover for law breaking.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no AI exemption from the laws on the books,\u201d she said.\n--With assistance from Leah Nylen.\n(Updates with new details starting in first paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThere\u2019s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets\nBasketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer\u2019s New $2 Billion Arena\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly\u2019s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire\nHow to Handle the Dreaded Political Shop Talk at Work\nAI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Adobe in December scrapped its $20 billion deal for design software maker Figma, citing \"no clear path\" for antitrust approvals in Europe and the UK.\nRegulators are worried that the acquisition of smaller rivals will result in a few companies accessing large pools of customer data and controlling the market.\nAmazon had in July slashed its offer by about 15% after iRobot incurred fresh debt.\nThat month, the EU also warned Amazon the deal, cleared by UK regulators, could reduce competition in the market.\nIRobot's shares have fallen 53% since the deal was announced.\nThe European Commission has until Feb. 14 to either approve or reject the deal.\n(Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese and Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru; Foo Yun Chee in Brussels)\n"

A drive for profitability, the remains of the pandemic hiring hangover, rapidly developing AI and\u2014somewhat ironically\u2014slowing inflation all play a part, according to industry watchers, while the timing can be blamed on the corporate budget calendar. But there's a silver lining, with the still-tight labor market meaning laid-off techies should be able to find work elsewhere.\nGoogle was clear in its job-cut announcement this week that it was cutting several hundred workers to further reduce costs. CEO Sundar Pichai told employees in a memo that the company wanted to invest more in emerging areas, including AI, while cutting costs elsewhere. \u201cWe have ambitious goals and will be investing in our big priorities this year,\u201d he wrote in a memo confirmed by Fortune. A company spokesperson characterized the cuts as \u201cresponsibly investing in our company's biggest priorities\u201d and said \u201ca number of our teams made changes to become more efficient and work better.\u201d Some Google employees pushed back against this rationale, with members of the Alphabet Workers Union blasting the company\u2019s \u201csenseless, misguided corporate decision making\u201d in a press release.\nOther multi-billion-dollar tech companies, like Amazon, also announced hundreds of employee cuts from its media divisions, including Prime Video, Amazon MGM Studios, video streaming platform Twitch, and Audible, its audiobook and podcast division. After tens of thousands of cuts last year, which hit areas seen as less essential to the company\u2019s bottom line including voice-assistant Alexa, this month's cuts likewise attempts to slash costs in the high-cost, lower-profit area of content, where Amazon is the number-three spender after rivals Netflix and Disney.\nAnother reason tech giants can keep reducing their ranks of employees is because their employee pools are still quite deep, after the \u201cwild hiring spree\u201d that many big companies embarked on during 2021 and 2022, as Challenger said. Last year\u2019s cuts were a result of that spree, when many tech companies trimmed down their workforces after realizing they over-hired in prior years. With the latest cuts, some of those companies are realizing they didn\u2019t cut enough in the first rounds.\nFrom hiring to layoffs, \u201ctech is one of the areas that has seen the quickest turnaround,\u201d Challenger said.\nAfter the pandemic boom, companies are also buckling in for slower growth ahead, with interest rates staying higher for longer\u2014which also plays into the renewed focus on profitability. \u201cAs with many other companies in the tech space, we are now sizing our organization based upon the current scale of our business,\u201d Twitch CEO Dan Clancy wrote last week, adding that his company is erring on the side of caution with \u201cconservative predictions of how we expect to grow in the future.\u201d\nRelatedly, the rise of AI in other parts of the tech world has also made the climate frostier for technology hires. Since the massive popularization of AI chatbot ChatGPT, companies have been focused on hiring AI-adjacent roles in an arms race with competitors to get ahead of what\u2019s believed to be the next tech boom. At the same time, they\u2019re downsizing non-AI areas to manage their expenses and keep their businesses profitable. And AI\u2019s feared job-killing aspects could have ramifications here, too, although it\u2019s only playing a small role at the moment, Challenger said. Companies said AI was responsible for 4,000 cuts last year, per the report, but it \u201cis something we\u2019re concerned about for the future,\u201d Challenger said.\nIronically, the falling inflation that has been a boon for consumers is also a factor in the tech layoffs, according to Challenger. As of last month, annual inflation is around 3%, substantially lower than its 6% rate at the start of the year. But because prices are no longer rising as quickly, this makes it harder for companies to raise the cost of their services, as customers, whose paychecks are also stymied by inflation, may not be willing to pay more for them, Challenger said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder for companies to increase their prices as they have been,\u201d while also paying for increased labor costs, he said. \u201cSo this inflationary cycle is one of the main culprits for these layoffs.\u201d\nIt\u2019s never great to find out you\u2019re losing your job, he said, but explained that this period is better than most because \u201cunemployment is still below 4%, and a lot of people that lose their jobs now have a high likelihood of finding more work pretty quickly.\u201d\nThere's another reason for the timing of cuts in January, and that\u2019s simply the corporate budget calendar. Job cuts tend to spike in December and January as companies prepare for structural changes heading into the new year, economist Rachel Sederberg told USA Today.\n\u201cA lot of firms are reaching their fiscal year-end,\u201d\u00a0 Sederberg, senior economist at labor markets analytics firm Lightcast, told the outlet. \u201cThey're taking a hard look at what's going on their balance sheets as well as how the business is performing, and they make decisions along those lines. And sometimes that has implications for workers.\u201d\nChallenger told Fortune that \u201cfiscal year-ends have shifted over time,\u201d which allows some companies to refrain from cutting workers right before or after the holidays. That\u2019s a bittersweet development for workers, since it can mean the pain of layoffs extends deeper into a new year than before.\nIn December, job cuts were down by 24% from the previous month and marked the second-lowest monthly cuts in 2023. Compared to December 2022, this year\u2019s cuts are down by 20%. Challenger confirmed that more cuts should be expected at least into the first quarter of the new year.\nRelated sectors, like media, have also seen more cuts as companies shift focus on profitability in a tough economic climate.\nJob cuts in media industries have boomed even more than the rest. Last year, the industry scraped over 21,400 jobs, up more than 460% from about 3,750 jobs cut during the same period in 2022. With an exception of 2020, it\u2019s the most jobs the industry has slashed since 2009, which saw over 22,000 jobs cut.\nIn a round of layoffs in November, online publisher Vox Media cut 4% of its staff. Earlier in March, the company slashed 7% of its workforce.\u00a0Conde Nast, which publishes magazines like Vogue, GQ and Vanity Fair, fired 5% of its employees in November.\u00a0This week, Sports Illustrated said it would cut its entire newsroom, while staff at the Los Angeles Times walked out in protest of \"substantial\" job cuts that the paper's owner had promised.\nLooking ahead, Challenger said that the cuts are expected to continue into the new year. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen job cuts increase over every sector in the past year,\u201d he said. \u201cThese three have just seen the most this year.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. received inquiries from the US Federal Trade Commission on their investments and partnerships with artificial intelligence startups Anthropic and OpenAI, part of a study on how AI is impacting competition in the technology industry.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMusk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain\nTech Giants Drop in Late Trading After Earnings: Markets Wrap\nUPS CEO Kicks Off Productivity Drive by Cutting 12,000 Managers\nTraders Line Up for \u2018Once-in-a-Generation\u2019 Emerging Markets Bet\nBlackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers\nThe antitrust and consumer protection agency on Thursday said it sent subpoenas to the companies to gather information. The probe focuses on more than $19 billion in investments by Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet\u2019s Google, a series of transactions that cemented alliances between the world\u2019s cloud-services giants and the leading developers of artificial intelligence software.\nAntitrust enforcers across the world have become concerned as many of the most promising AI startups now depend heavily on the old guard of dominant tech companies for their financing and infrastructure needs.\nIn comments during a public workshop Thursday, FTC Chair Lina Khan said the agency is closely monitoring the industry and warned that AI companies \u201ccannot use claims of innovation as cover for law breaking.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no AI exemption from the laws on the books,\u201d she said.\nGoogle said it doesn\u2019t have exclusive rights to Anthropic\u2019s technology, and its investment doesn\u2019t include a board seat or voting rights.\n\u201cWe hope the FTC\u2019s study will shine a bright light on companies that don\u2019t offer the openness of Google Cloud,\u201d said Peter Schottenfels, a company spokesperson.\nMicrosoft said the US is a leader in artificial intelligence because of collaborations between American companies.\n\u201cPartnerships between independent companies like Microsoft and OpenAI, as well as among many others, are promoting competition and accelerating innovation,\u201d said Rima Alaily, Microsoft\u2019s top competition lawyer. \u201cWe look forward to providing the FTC with the information it needs to complete its study.\u201d\nAmazon and Anthropic declined to comment. OpenAI didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nThe inquiry comes as technology giants take a bigger role in backing nimble AI startups in a bid to stake a claim in the booming sector. Over the past year, Microsoft has revamped nearly all of its products around AI tools powered by OpenAI\u2019s technology, while Google has said it plans to embed its most powerful large language model, Gemini, into its experimental search tool sometime this year.\nMicrosoft has invested more than $13 billion in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The ouster and subsequent reinstatement of Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s chief executive officer, in November exposed how inextricably linked Microsoft and the company have become. Those ties have already spurred antitrust reviews in both the UK and the European Union.\nMeanwhile, Google in October committed to back Anthropic with $2 billion, and Amazon last year also agreed to an investment of as much as $4 billion. Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, who left that company amid differences over the direction of the business.\nRead More: Big Tech\u2019s Massive AI Startup Deals, By the Numbers\nRebecca Kelly Slaughter, one of the FTC\u2019s three Democrats, criticized the tech giants for structuring their transactions in a way designed to avoid the US merger law that would have required them to notify antitrust enforcers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to wonder whether these investments could lead to a heavily consolidated market dominated by only a few,\u201d she said at the same workshop where Khan spoke.\nBut, she warned, \u201cstudying a market is a compliment to, and not a substitute for, appropriate enforcement.\u201d\nMicrosoft didn\u2019t report the OpenAI transaction to the agency because the investment doesn\u2019t amount to control of the company under US law, Bloomberg has reported. OpenAI is also a nonprofit, and acquisitions of non-corporate entities aren\u2019t reported under US merger law, regardless of value.\nIn the case of Google and Amazon, the deals were structured as convertible notes, a type of debt that will convert to equity at the startup\u2019s next funding round. Those don\u2019t require notification to the agency until they\u2019re converted.\nThe FTC is conducting the inquiry under its so-called 6(b) authority that allows it to issue subpoenas to conduct market studies. The agency generally issues a report on its findings after analyzing the information from companies, though that process can take years to complete. The agency is still finalizing the results of studies on pharmaceutical middlemen and supply chains that it started in 2021 and 2022.\nAlthough the information is collected for research purposes, the FTC can use any details it gleans to open official investigations or aid in existing probes. Last summer, the agency opened an investigation into whether OpenAI has violated consumer protection laws with its popular ChatGPT conversational AI bot.\nThe FTC and its sister agency, the Justice Department, share jurisdiction over antitrust probes and have been debating internally which should take the lead on AI. The Justice Department has generally handled antitrust issues related to Microsoft since its blockbuster monopolization case against the Windows maker in the late 1990s. The FTC, however, recently handled Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of game developer Activision Blizzard Inc.\nIn addition, the European Commission is looking into some of the agreements that have been struck between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers. The EU\u2019s executive arm is investigating the impact of these partnerships on market dynamics. The UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority said in December that it also would probe Microsoft and OpenAI\u2019s partnership.\n--With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary, Julia Love, Matt Day and Jackie Davalos.\n(Updates with Google and Microsoft statements beginning in sixth paragraph.

        "Title": "Could Sea Limited Stock Become the Next Amazon?",
        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) is often overlooked in the universe of e-commerce conglomerates. Although it is a much younger, smaller company than Amazon, its Shopee e-commerce arm holds a market lead in Southeast Asia. And like MercadoLibre, it operates a fintech business.\nHowever, Sea Limited often gets overlooked in favor of Alibaba and other China-based conglomerates. Moreover, its gaming business has struggled, and investors seem to have focused on the negative.\nDoes that mean an investor should buy before more investors recognize the entertainment stock's potential? Let's take a closer look.\nAt first glance, it is easy to see Sea Limited as the \"Amazon of Southeast Asia.\" Shopee continues to lead in Southeast Asia, a market investors have overlooked. Also, comparing its $20 billion market cap to Amazon's market cap of $1.6 trillion may imply more untapped growth potential for Sea Limited stock.\nIndeed, overlooking that market is likely a mistake. The seven Southeast Asian countries that are the core of Shopee's market have a combined population of more than 600 million. While not as large as China at 1.4 billion, that is almost twice the population of the U.S.\nAdditionally, it consists of wealthy markets like Singapore and fast-growing developing markets such as Vietnam and Thailand, which can serve as growth engines. It also operates in Brazil and maintains a limited operation in three other Latin American countries.\nFurthermore, Sea Limited had the same challenges as MercadoLibre with online selling to cash-based customers. But like its Latin American counterpart, it has formed a fintech arm, SeaMoney, that is now the fastest-growing part of the business.\nHowever, as mentioned, its struggles come from its original business: gaming segment Garena.\nDuring the pandemic, Free Fire became the world's most downloaded mobile game. But the end of the pandemic and a ban in India reduced the game's popularity. And just as its return to India appeared imminent, Alphabet's Google Play removed the Indian version of the game from its store in December, leaving its future in doubt.\nUltimately, Garena's revenue dropped 43% yearly in the first nine months of 2023. In comparison, the other two business segments reported a combined growth rate of 34% during the same period.\nFortunately, gaming made up less than 18% of the company's revenue during this period, reducing the impact of its massive decline. Garena also reported 12% revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023 versus the previous quarter, implying the worst may be over.\nIn the first nine months of 2023, Sea's overall revenue of $9.4 billion was up 5% versus the same period in 2022. Despite perceptions implied by the aforementioned market cap comparison, Amazon grew net sales by 11% over the same time frame.\nMoreover, Garena's performance may lead to investors overlooking some key positives for the company. In the first nine months of 2023, free cash flow was more than $1.6 billion, a dramatic turnaround from the negative free cash flow of approximately $2.5 billion during the same period in 2022.\nFurthermore, despite the stock losing more than 35% of its value over the last year, the P/E ratio of 31 is far below that of Amazon or MercadoLibre. This likely means that once Garena can move past its struggles, the stock can begin to grow again.\nAt current levels, it is unclear whether Sea Limited is the \"next Amazon,\" but it looks increasingly like a stock to buy. Admittedly, Garena's challenges should rightly concern investors. With gaming being its original business, that might lead to questions about the company's identity.\nHowever, investors should remember that most of its revenue now comes from e-commerce and fintech. As those segments of the company continue to prosper, they could experience growth reminiscent of Amazon.\nMoreover, its comparatively low P/E ratio should bode well for the stock. As investors pay more attention to Asia outside of China, Southeast Asia's demographics and growth rates could attract more investors to Sea Limited stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sea Limited right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Sea Limited, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Sea Limited wasn't one of them.

Additionally, any Mexican consumer over 18 years of age can use this payment option.\n\"Customers are increasingly looking for flexible payment options to help them meet their purchasing needs,\" said Karen Pepper, Head of Digital Payments for Amazon Mexico. \"Paying in bi-weekly installments with Kueski Pay is Amazon's latest initiative to provide customers in Mexico with access to affordable payment methods, and expanding Amazon's secure financing offers with a simple fee structure demonstrating our commitment that Amazon is for everyone.\"\nKueski is among the leading online consumer credit and BNPL platforms in Latin America, having granted nearly 15 million loans to individuals and entrepreneurs throughout Mexico. The company estimates that one in four of the largest e-commerce merchants in the country offer Kueski Pay as a payment solution, while more than 60% of its customers declare that even though they have a credit card, they still prefer to use Kueski Pay as a payment option due to its flexibility.\n\"This agreement enables Amazon customers to enjoy, for the first time in Mexico, a buy now, pay later option at checkout,\" said Andrew Seiz, SVP of Finance at Kueski. \"This is a significant step forward for Kueski as a leader in flexible payment solutions. Making BNPL available on Amazon Mexico gives millions more people access to the vast Amazon marketplace wherever they are in the country. We are thrilled to help pave the way forward for BNPL and increase access to financial services for all Mexicans.\"\nTo learn more about Kueski Pay, visit: www.amazon.com.mx/pagoenquincenas\nAbout Kueski\nKueski is the leading buy now, pay later (BNPL) and online consumer credit platform in Latin America, known for its innovative financial services.

        "Text": "Good morning.\nReputation matters in business. Just think of what has happened to Boeing, which five years ago ranked in the top 20 of Fortune\u2019s World\u2019s Most Admired all-stars.\u00a0These days it\u2019s the butt of screw-loose jokes.\u00a0Meanwhile Nvidia has soared up the list over the last\u00a0four years, landing at No. 10 in our latest ranking, out this morning.\u00a0Ask anyone at either company if these reputational changes matter, and they will tell you:\u00a0They do. Big time.\nWhich is why Fortune\u2019s annual World\u2019s Most Admired Companies list deserves some attention.\u00a0The\u00a0more than\u00a03,700 executives, directors, and analysts polled in this effort by our partners at Korn Ferry don\u2019t, for the most part, have any special window into what\u2019s going on at these companies.\u00a0But they do have a good sense of how they are viewed by the people who matter. \nSo what can we learn from this year\u2019s list? Well first of all, when it comes to reputation, tech rules.\u00a0Apple is No. 1, Microsoft No. 2, and Amazon No. 3.\u00a0But that\u2019s why I think special credit should be given to legacy companies who continue to rank well.\u00a0Take Walmart, a company that many once thought would be defeated by the ascent of Amazon.\u00a0Instead, its\u00a0reputation continues to rise, hitting the No. 9 spot this year, up from 13 last year. (If, like me, you are fascinated by the Walmart-Amazon rivalry, I recommend Fortune reporter Jason Del Rey\u2019s excellent new book\u00a0Winner Sells All,\u00a0which you can buy on\u00a0Walmart.com or Amazon.com\u2014or buy a copy on both and compare the experience!)\nSo what else can you learn from this year\u2019s list? Well, kudos to Eli Lilly, which jumped onto the all-star list at No. 34 this year, and ended Johnson & Johnson\u2019s 10-year reign as the most admired pharmaceutical company.\u00a0And regrets to Disney, which fell to No. 12 from No. 6, and ceded its spot as the most admired entertainment company to Netflix.\u00a0(Note that the methodology for choosing\u00a0the top-ranked companies within industries\u00a0is different than that for choosing all-stars, which is why Netflix still ranks below Disney on the all-star list at No. 23.)\nCredit also goes to Moderna (No. 37), Mastercard (No. 40), L\u2019Oreal (No. 43), and\u00a0Adobe (No. 46),\u00a0which made the top 50 after not being ranked last year.\u00a0And bye-bye to last year\u2019s winners McDonald\u2019s, Nestle, Unilever, Lockheed Martin, and Charles Schwab, which dropped off the list.\nYou can explore the full list here.

        "Text": "Amazon-owned online audiobook and podcast service Audible is laying off about 5% of its workforce, marking the third round of job cuts at the e-commerce giant's businesses this week as the technology industry continues to shed roles in the new year.\nIn a memo sent to employees Thursday, Audible CEO Bob Carrigan said the company is in good shape, but faces an \"increasingly challenging landscape.\u201d\n\u201cWe did not take this route without considerable thought,\u201d Carrigan said. \u201cBut getting leaner and more efficient is the way we will need to operate now \u2014 and in the foreseeable future \u2014 in order to continue delivering best-in-class audio storytelling to our customers around the world.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Audible declined to provide the number of employees who will be affected by the cuts.\nThe layoffs at Audible follow others announced this week in Amazon\u2019s Prime Video and MGM Studios unit, which is trimming hundreds of employees from its payroll as it cuts back in areas that are not delivering. Earlier this week, Amazon-owned streaming platform Twitch also said it was cutting more than 500 jobs in a bid to save on costs and become more profitable.\nAudible was purchased by Seattle-based Amazon in 2008 for roughly $300 million and is both a top distributor and producer of audio books, meditation programs and podcasts. The service is dominant in the audiobook market and has sought to pull in more customers through exclusive content and high-profile deals, including a multiyear agreement it inked with Higher Ground Productions, a production company founded by former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle.\nTech companies like Amazon ramped up hiring during the pandemic, but they began cutting costs as inflation and interest rates spiked and their focus turned to profitability.\nThe recent job cuts follows mass layoffs that began at Amazon in late 2022 and have impacted more than 27,000 employees.\nAlso on Thursday, a spokesperson for Discord confirmed that the social media company is laying off 17% of its staff \u2013 or 170 employees \u2013 in what it characterized as a move to bring more agility to its workforce after a pandemic-induced surge in hiring.\nOther tech companies \u2014 including Google, IT company Xerox and video game software provider Unity Software \u2014 have also announced layoffs in recent days, signaling the industry\u2019s job shedding is far from over.\n"

        "Author": "  James Titcomb ",
        "Text": "Homeowners will be able to share footage from video doorbells to alert neighbours about suspected crimes under plans for a neighbourhood watch app from Amazon.\nThe tech giant\u2019s smart doorbell company, Ring, is considering launching a grassroots social network called Neighbours in countries such as the UK.\nThe smartphone app connects to video doorbells to allow users to post footage of suspected crimes and receive real-time alerts on incidents in the area.\nThe app, which has been criticised for its relationship with police forces, currently exists in the US. However, Liz Hamren, Ring\u2019s chief executive, said the company was planning to expand.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at bringing that to other other markets,\u201d she said, adding that \u201c[the UK] is one of the biggest and most important markets\u201d.\nMs Hamren said there was \u201cnothing to share at this time, but one of the things that I think I\u2019m excited about is people being able to share a wide range of videos with their neighbours\u201d.\nAlmost one in five households in Britain \u2013 18pc \u2013 have a smart doorbell, security camera or alarm system, according to Ofcom, up from 5pc in 2020.\nTheir rise has come amid growing criticism that police are failing to pursue criminals for cases such as bicycle and vehicle theft.\nVideo doorbells are seen as a way of deterring package theft, which has exploded as fewer people work from home.\nMembership of the Neighbourhood Watch, the community organisation designed to keep streets safe, has fallen by half since 2000.\nRing launched the Neighbours app in the US in 2018. It connects to video doorbells to allow users to post about local crime and safety cases and receive real-time alerts on incidents in the area.\nThe app has been criticised for exaggerating the levels of crime in areas and over its work with police forces.\nVideo doorbell footage was used in the conviction of Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens over the murder of Sarah Everard in 2021 and the conviction of Collin Reeves for the double murder of his relatives in Somerset. The devices have been credited with reducing the number of drivers fleeing the scene of accidents.\nRing has provided police forces with doorbells to hand out to citizens or in other cases forces have provided discounts on buying them.\nSmart doorbells, hyperlocal social networks and neighbourhood WhatsApp groups have been accused of encouraging a new form of digital curtain twitching, but Ms Hamren said people had widely become used to surveillance cameras.\n\u201cThe reality of the world that we live in is that there are lots of cameras,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you walk into a retail store, in an airport, a mall, across the world, there are cameras. Our goal is to let people know that they\u2019re being recorded because they\u2019re standing in front of a doorbell; that transparency is the really important part.\u201d\nRing\u2019s Neighbours app has cut ties with police forces in the US. Last week, it said it would no longer allow forces to use the app to request doorbell footage from residents, which led to criticism from some police forces.\nMs Hamren said that supporting the feature was not a priority.\n\u201cWe are not investing in technology that allows public agencies to request within our app and then receive within our app,\u201d she added. \u201cOur stakeholder is the consumer. It is about making sure that we are empowering them to do all the things that they want to do.\u201d\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

        "Title": "Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 January 29, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN.\nTech stocks have maintained their market leadership in the New Year, building on last year's standout performance. Driving this momentum has been a combination of favorable developments on the macro front, primarily growing confidence that the Fed is on track to start easing policy, having subdued inflation without endangering the economy.\nMore specific to the Tech sector is optimism about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) that some view warily as reminiscent of the late 1990s and an emerging sense we are getting close to putting the worst of Tech spending headwinds behind us.\nWith many Tech companies on deck to report December-quarter results this week, the market will be looking for more color on business spending trends, particularly on the cloud side.\nA big part of Tech's improved earnings outlook in 2023 was a function of more effective cost controls that helped stabilize margins. Improved clarity on top-line trends will help solidify the favorable revisions trend and undergird the group's impressive stock market momentum.\nOn top of it all is the AI debate, where we have already seen direct revenue impact from the likes of Nvidia and some ideas from Microsoft. Still, the innovation's productivity-enhancing potential appears to be some ways off in the future.\nThe stock market is essentially a discounting system of the future. To the extent that we see viable business models in the days ahead that make use of AI and the so-called large language models, beyond Nvidia selling more capable chips and Microsoft starting to charge for new AI-driven bells and whistles in its Office productivity suite, the stock market excitement would be totally justified.\nThese topics will be front and center in this week's earnings reports from five of the 'Big 7 Tech players' - Alphabet and Microsoft after the market's close on Tuesday (1/30), Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple after the close on Thursday (02/01). Of the remaining two members of this 'club,' Tesla has reported already, and Nvidia's results will be coming out at the end of February.\nApple shares may not have had as impressive a showing as the other distinguished members of this club, but it has nevertheless been a standout performer. The bigger question in the Apple story appears to be the China outlook, though headlines about the watch line may have also weighed on sentiment.\nDigital advertising has historically been seen as core to Alphabet and Meta, but Amazon has steadily become a major player in the space as well. Ad spending has stabilized in the last couple of quarters, and it will be interesting to see how these management teams see trends for the current and coming periods, given the macroeconomic uncertainties. This will also be at play in the Snap report, which reports Q4 results the following week (February 6th).\nAll of these companies are big players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, with the Microsoft vs. Alphabet rivalry particularly intense. With the initial excitement around ChatGPT and other AI applications now behind us, the questions now center around how these AI capabilities will be monetized through new and existing business models. It is reasonable to expect each of these management teams to spend considerable time on their Q4 earnings calls on their AI plan.\nThe group is expected to bring in +38.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues. Please note that these expectations have steadily increased in recent months.\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled-forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. As you can see above, the expectation is for the group to be firmly back in the 'regular/normal' growth model, but much of that is contingent on how the macroeconomic picture unfolds.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.3% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues.\nAs was the case with the 'Big 7 Tech Players,' the Tech sector as a whole has been dealing with the pulled-forward revenues and earnings during Covid over the last many quarters. In fact, earnings growth for the Zacks Tech sector turned positive only in 2023 Q2 after remaining in negative territory during the four quarters prior to that.\nThis big-picture view of the 'Big 7 players' and the overall sector shows that the worst of the growth challenge has moved into the rearview mirror.\nThe 2023 Q4 earnings are expected to be up +1.1% on +2.4% higher revenues. This follows the +3.8% earnings growth reading we saw in the preceding period (2023 Q3) and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings prior to that.\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, January 26th, we now have Q4 results from 124 S&P 500 members, or 24.8% of the index's total membership.\nWe have over 300 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned mega-tech players, this week's line-up includes a who's who of the index, including Boeing, Pfizer, International Paper, Starbucks, Exxon, Chevron, and many others.\nTotal Q4 earnings for the 124 index members that have reported already are down -0.4% from the same period last year on +3.4% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 69.4% beating revenue estimates.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Breaking Down the Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard \nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Best Reusable Water Bottles on Amazon Under $50.\nThe Stanley fever has taken TikTok and Instagram by storm. There are over 1.73 million posts each for the hashtag #Stanley and #stanleycup on Instagram, as of January 26. Social media influencers are heavily invested in creating content that revolves around Stanley cups and their various uses. On January 19, BBC reported on the fever behind the Stanley Cup sensation. The hashtag #StanleyCup has more than 7.2 billion views on social media across the globe. The brand is also expected to report $750 million in sales in 2023, $70 million more than in 2020. As per the report, the success of the brand is heavily attributed to its marketing capabilities.\nWhile popularity may be good news for the brand, not all fame has positive outcomes. The fever has coerced people into committing crimes and unethical activities. For instance, a man was witnessed jumping across the Starbucks counter to get his hands on the limited edition pink cup. Arguably, the cups first caught attention for their eco-friendly nature. However, the impact of social media on consumerism raises important questions about future marketing strategies, especially social media marketing.\nSome of the leading companies that produce reusable water bottles include Newell Brands Inc.

        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In the third quarter of 2023 (ended Sept. 30), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) generated revenue of $143 billion. The vast majority of this, about $92 billion, was derived from online stores and third-party seller services, which are directly related to the company's insanely successful digital marketplace.\nIt has long been the case that Amazon's e-commerce operations were the bread and butter of the business. After all, the company was founded with the goal of selling books online, which eventually turned into consumers being able to buy just about anything they wanted from the comfort of their homes.\nWith so many billions in e-commerce revenue, investors may be surprised to learn that this tech titan generated 62% of its Q3 operating income from an entirely different segment. Here's what you need to know.\nGenerating over $23 billion in sales last quarter, Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides businesses and governments with various tech infrastructure services, like computing power, storage capacity, and database management. Compared to investing in IT tools on-site, these cloud computing customers benefit from lower costs and from having the flexibility to adjust their needs up or down at any time. This frees up capital that would otherwise be tied up in long-term projects.\nAWS, whose clients include Walt Disney, Verizon Communications, and Capital One, is tiny (as measured by revenue) when compared to the company overall. But its profitability is notable. The segment posted a stellar 30% operating margin in Q3, generating $7 billion in Q3 operating income. For comparison's sake, Amazon as a whole reported $11.2 billion in operating income last quarter.\nThis outsized profitability demonstrates the monster potential of AWS. It has long dominated the industry, with about one-third of the global market share. As it continues scaling up, it's easy to believe that margins will keep expanding. In the first quarter of 2015, AWS registered an operating margin of 17%, so it has improved over time.\nBut it was discouraging to see AWS' chief rivals, Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, posting much faster revenue growth in the latest quarter. Of course, they are starting from a smaller sales base, but this is not a good trend.\nCEO Andy Jassy doesn't seem worried. \"We're seeing the pace and volume of closed deals pick up, and we're encouraged by the strong last couple of months of new deals signed,\" he said optimistically on the Q3 2023 earnings call.\nAnd zooming out, there is a ton of growth to be achieved. Grand View Research estimates that by 2030, the global market for cloud infrastructure services will be worth a whopping $1.6 trillion in annual revenue, rising at about 14% per year until then. As the clear leader in the industry, AWS is in a prime position to benefit from this trend.\nWhile AWS is certainly a major growth and profitability driver for Amazon, investors shouldn't completely ignore other divisions that are critical to the operations as well. \nIt's hard to envision a scenario where the online marketplace doesn't remain the focal point for the business for the foreseeable future. Management has made huge investments to bolster the company's logistics footprint to better serve customers, and this will continue to provide benefits when drawing in shoppers looking for low prices and fast shipping.\nThe popularity of Amazon.com has spawned another booming revenue source. Most investors might not know that Amazon currently produces the third-most digital advertising revenue in the world, behind only Alphabet and Meta Platforms. This is just another growth engine the company can lean on.\nNonetheless, it's almost a certainty that AWS will keep rising in importance in the years ahead.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "Text": "Amazon Prime members today may notice something looks a little different when they watch Prime Video: They\u2019ll have to watch ads, unless they want to pay a little extra.\nStarting Monday, Prime Video will feature \u201climited\u201d advertisements in its shows and movies. To avoid ads, customers will have to pay $2.99 a month more. Amazon first announced the change in September.\n\u201cThis will allow us to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time,\u201d Amazon said in an email to Prime members in December. \u201cWe aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers.\u201d\nAmazon is hardly alone in making the change. Prime Video is joining most other streaming services by inserting ads into its programming and raising prices on ad-free tiers.\nThat\u2019s because streaming services are no long chasing subscribers, but rather investors are pressuring them to make money off the services, even if it comes at the expense of losing subscriptions. As a result, they are selling ads or hiking monthly prices.\nNetflix in October said its premium ad-free plan in the United States will increase by $3 per month, to $22.99. Its one-stream basic plan rose to $11.99 in the United States; that plan is grandfathered in and is no longer available for new or rejoining members. All other plans, including its entry-level, $6.99-a-month ad-supported tier, remained at the same monthly cost.\nIn August, Disney+ increased prices for the second time in less than a year, with the monthly cost of its ad-free plan rising to $13.99 in October \u2014 a $3 increase. Hulu, in which Disney owns a majority stake, will also hike its monthly ad-free subscription $3 to $17.99.\nMax, owned by CNN parent company Warner Bros. Discovery, raised prices in January 2023 by $1 a month \u2014 its first-ever price hike. And Peacock, owned by NBCUniversal, also had its first-ever price hike in July.\nThe price hikes come as streaming companies search for additional revenue. Consumer demand for streaming services has slowed dramatically since the pandemic, cutting into streamers\u2019 revenue growth.\nMeanwhile, the cost for producing shows has risen, and it will continue to go up as the actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 new negotiated contracts kick in. Raising prices is one way to solve streaming companies\u2019 financial issues.\nWhen Amazon first announced the change in September, it explained that ads will help it continue to produce popular programs, such as \u201cThursday Night Football.\u201d Spending on Amazon\u2019s content, which includes its original series, soared nearly 30% in 2022 to $16.6 billion.\nA recent Morgan Stanley report predicts that ads on Prime Video will generate more than $3 billion in additional revenue this year, soaring up to $7 billion in 2026.\nThe company didn\u2019t reveal how long the ad breaks will be. Prime Video, which is home to the new Nicole Kidman series \u201cExpats\u201d and \u201cCitadel,\u201d is included in the $139 yearly Prime subscription.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

This specialization is particularly timely, tapping into the exponential growth of e-commerce and the consequent demand for distribution centers and warehouses. The surge in online shopping, accelerated by digital transformation and consumer behavior shifts, makes Prologis a strategic choice for investors aiming for consistent, growth-oriented returns.\nAn intriguing aspect of investing in Prologis is the indirect connection it offers to one of the world's largest e-commerce companies, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). While Prologis\u2019 tenants are diverse, Amazon stands out as a notable lessee, making an investment in Prologis an indirect way of tapping into the retail giant's expansive growth. This relationship with Amazon adds a fascinating dimension to Prologis' investment appeal \u2013 it's like earning dividends from Amazon's continued expansion and dominance in the e-commerce sector.\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Dara Khosrowshahi-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\u00a0\nInvestors usually face a trade-off between growth and income; high-growth investments rarely provide regular income, and high-dividend stocks often don't offer substantial growth prospects. Prologis, however, breaks this mold. By investing in the logistics real estate that is fundamental to the operation of e-commerce giants like Amazon, Prologis is firmly positioned in a rapidly growing sector. At the same time, its status as a REIT means it distributes the majority of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.\nPrologis owns and manages a vast array of logistics properties across strategic locations globally, including key urban and suburban areas. This extensive geographical footprint is vital in mitigating risks associated with regional economic variations. The company\u2019s properties, which serve as critical hubs for e-commerce giants and supply chain operators, ensure a strong and diverse tenant base. The increasing reliance on efficient logistics and distribution networks underscores the long-term demand for Prologis\u2019 properties.During the fourth quarter of 2023,\u00a0 Prologis announced a dividend of $0.87 per share. The total dividends paid from January to December 2023 were $3.48.\nInvesting in Prologis offers more than a stake in industrial real estate; it provides a pathway to indirectly benefit from Amazon's success. As e-commerce continues to flourish, driven by consumer preferences and technological advancements, Prologis' role in this ecosystem becomes increasingly vital, potentially enhancing its dividend prospects. This connection offers a compelling reason for investors to consider Prologis as a way to diversify their portfolio and gain exposure to the booming e-commerce sector.\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class.

        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the top e-commerce company in the world. Its Prime Day and Black Friday sales often serve as indicators for how well the global economy is doing. Moreover, it's been a fantastic growth stock. A $20,000 investment in it 20 years ago would be worth more than $1.1 million today.\nBut as well as it has performed over the long haul, it has slowed down in recent years. There's another stock, also involved in e-commerce and tech, that has been an even better buy of late, and that's Shopify (NYSE: SHOP).\nShopify went public in 2015 and has been red-hot ever since. Aside from 2022, when the markets as a whole struggled, Shopify has delivered consistently positive returns since 2016 (its first full year on the market). And it has also done better than Amazon in almost every one of those years.\nWhat has made Shopify successful is its ability to help anyone become an online vendor quickly and easily. For a recurring fee, it will help any business set up and manage an online shop to sell its goods and services all over the world. And there is no need to go onto a different platform, such as Amazon, to sell those items. Merchants can do so right on their own websites. \nThe ease of use and attractiveness of Shopify's services have enabled it to be a big player in e-commerce. And a big reason for the stock's superior returns over Amazon in recent years is that its growth rate has also been significantly higher.\nAMZN revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months.\nThe advantages Shopify has are that as a smaller company, it takes much less growth in absolute terms to provide it with faster growth on a percentage basis, and it has more room to expand its footprint, especially in a massive industry such as e-commerce. Its revenue over the past four quarters totaled $6.7 billion, while Amazon generated more than $554 billion in sales during the same period.\nInvestors' hopes that Shopify will become the \"next Amazon\" are likely a key reason why the stock has performed so well and been such a hot buy. But even today, its market capitalization is just under $100 billion -- nowhere near the $1.5 trillion market cap of Amazon.\nBoth Shopify and Amazon are attractive growth stock options for investors to consider for the long haul, and it would be hard to go wrong with either one for your portfolio, especially as the global economy grows.\nBut I do believe that Shopify can continue to outperform Amazon. Over the years, Amazon has been diversifying into industries like healthcare and video streaming in an effort to expand its growth opportunities. But I think by focusing primarily on e-commerce, Shopify could produce better results in the long run.\nIf you want to buy only one of these stellar e-commerce stocks, then buy Shopify. But there would be nothing wrong with investing in both.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Title": "Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 10 Years?",
        "Author": "  Demitri Kalogeropoulos, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The best stock market returns accumulate over decades rather than quarters. That's why billionaire investor Warren Buffett cites his longevity as a key supporting factor in his portfolio's massive growth over the last several decades. \"It helps to start early and live into your 90's,\" he told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders in this year's annual report.\nGrowth-stock investors can seek to replicate some of his success by taking a much longer outlook on their investments. With that goal in mind, let's look at Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) prospects for success in the coming decade. Where will the business, and the stock, be by early 2034?\nE-commerce will always be a big part of Amazon's business, but the future seems to be all about its services sales. That segment is anchored by the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform and includes things like Prime subscriptions and advertising sales. Through the first three quarters of 2023, that unit clocked in at $226 billion, or 56% of sales, and was expanding at a much faster rate than the e-commerce segment.\nIt wouldn't be a stretch to think that in a decade, Amazon's business might look more like Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) does today. It will sell products, sure, but almost all its profits will come from cloud and software services.\nThis shift has a good shot at enhancing profitability and boosting cash flow, as investors have already seen in the last few quarters. Amazon likely won't have Microsoft's 40% profit margin by 2034 but should post much stronger results than its current 4% level. And positive stock returns will track along with those financial improvements.\nIf you don't think artificial intelligence (AI) is a priority for Amazon, consider that the term \"generative AI\" showed up 18 times in its most recent earnings release. That tech is now deeply embedded in the AWS platform, which is already helping many of its biggest customers with their own AI projects.\nAmazon is also using it to improve the shopping and selling experiences on its e-commerce store, for example by sifting through product reviews to highlight factors that previous buyers have frequently mentioned.\nThere's no telling how AI will develop over the next decade, but it appears likely that Amazon will join other tech giants like Microsoft in leading the shift into this computing era. It's also unclear right now what impact the technology will have on Amazon's finances.\nThe early signs are encouraging, though. Generative AI is popular because it is creating more value across a wide range of business processes. That makes it probable that the technology will lift Amazon's profit margins even as it helps accelerate sales growth in the next decade.\nAmazon is currently valued more like a retailer than a software-as-a-service stock. Its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3 is closer to eBay's P/S of 2 than it is to Microsoft's ratio of 13 times annual sales.\nAmazon should close that gap with Microsoft over time if it continues shifting its business toward services sales while capitalizing on the AI boom. Many factors -- including a slowdown in spending on information technology, or a wider recession -- could delay or even derail these ambitions.\nBut Amazon stock seems primed to generate solid returns for patient investors over the next several years.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": " Alexandra Canal    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) is\u00a0expected to start rolling out ads on its Prime Video streaming service beginning Monday in the US \u2014 and Wall Street is bullish on the tech behemoth massively disrupting the shifting media market.\nPrime Video subscriptions will now automatically default to the ad-supported tier at current monthly rates of $14.99 for Prime delivery members and $8.99 for non-Prime members, or those who only subscribe to the standalone video service. Subscribers who want the ad-free version will now see their monthly bill go up by $3 a month.\n\"A 500 lb. gorilla enters the room,\" MoffettNathanson lead analyst Michael Morton wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"We strongly believe that Amazon\u2019s decision to add advertising to Prime Video will be a disruptive force to commoditized advertising video on demand (AVOD) players, siloed connected TV (CTV) platforms and non-top 20 linear cable networks.\"\nAmazon has roughly 96 million US Prime households, but only a subset of that actively engages with Prime Video, according to MoffettNathanson. The firm estimates Prime Video, which streams shows like \"Reacher\" and \"The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power,\" has an active US subscriber base that's roughly equivalent to Netflix\u2019s 70 million.\nAs a result of the new rollout, the firm anticipates video ad revenue of $1.3 billion in 2024\u00a0and $2.3 billion in 2025. Subscription revenue should also go up by $500 million annually for those who opt to pay extra for the premium tier.\n\"We forecast Amazon and Disney being neck-and-neck for largest drivers of AVOD ad-revenue,\" the analysts wrote, predicting the US connected TV and ad-supported market will hit $16 billion by 2025.\nAmazon is expected to lead the pack at $4 billion, with Hulu close behind at $3 billion. Peacock (CMCSA) and Roku (ROKU) round out the top four at $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.\nFollowing its US debut, the ad tier will roll out globally in the UK and Germany on Feb. 5 before dropping in France, Italy, Spain, Mexico, and Australia later this year. Amazon said it plans to have \"meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers.\"\nAccording to Adweek, ad buyers will pay a cost-per-thousand, or CPM rate, between $30 to $35. That's lower than what they pay to advertise on competitor platforms, which analysts say could lead to downward pressure on pricing.\nTo compare, Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS) were reportedly seeking a CPM rate between $50 and $60 for their respective ad tiers. Pushback from advertisers eventually convinced them to lower their asking price.\nIn addition to pricing, Amazon's decision to default users to the ad-supported tier also differs from competitors, although it was considered by one streaming giant.\n\"We did consider making [ads] the default option,\" Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said on Wednesday's earnings call. \"But given our long history of not having ads, we thought it was better for our members rather than force them into a change and give them ads.\"\nPeters added he's not concerned when it comes to Amazon entering the ad-supported arena, telling investors there's plenty of ad inventory to go around.\n\"We talked about over $25 billion in [connected TV] ad spend alone, so there's room for multiple players,\" he said, noting the streamer will compete by \"playing to its strengths\" like viewership engagement.\nStill, the move is widely expected to massively transform the industry.\n\"Amazon has one of the broadest audience reaches of all the streaming services,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen told Yahoo Finance. \"They have the reach, they have the consumer data. There will likely be an acceleration toward retail media spending, which could encourage everybody else to do more shop-able advertising.\"\n\"It just raises the stakes,\" the analyst continued. \"Everybody now faces another competitor and a very large supply of inventory that they're going to be competing for. It'll drive more demand, or better tools to get better pricing on ads through better targeting or better use of programmatic advertising.\"\nNollen added Amazon's entrance will also encourage a substantial shift of ad buyers from linear to streaming \u2014 yet another blow to legacy media as the cable bundle continues to deteriorate.\n\"Among media companies, the entire media sector would appear to be at risk with the greatest pain at Paramount (PARA) and AMC Networks (AMCX) given their lack of diversified profitability away from linear networks and limited exposure to live cable network content,\" MoffettNathanson wrote in its report.\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "Amazon layoffs show Big Tech is still coming down from pandemic highs",
        "Author": " Hamza Shaban    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "The COVID-era spending spree is over. And the tech layoffs keep coming.\nAmazon (AMZN) is eliminating several hundred roles across Prime Video and MGM Studios, according to a memo sent to staff on Wednesday. And the company's video game livestreaming platform, Twitch, announced it is laying off more than 500 people.\nThat Amazon is ringing in the new year with another round of cuts highlights the tech sector's climb down from COVID-era expansion. Even as confidence grows on Wall Street that the economy will finally break free from fears of a recession, tech companies are still reeling from heady staffing days and ambitious investments made during the early stages of the pandemic.\nDuring the acute phase of the public health crisis, company ranks swelled alongside aspirations of rapid growth and a tech-centric transformation. Many executives and market observers believed new consumer habits would redefine the trends to come and accelerate changes already on the way. Screen time exploded as social lives shrunk and adapted. But the spike in demand for e-commerce and digital services eventually leveled off, leaving executives with what they claimed were bloated teams and inefficiency. A brutal wave of job cuts was their answer.\n\"A lot of companies in various sectors of the economy had rapid expansion during the 'stay at home economy,'\" said Clark Bellin, president and chief investment officer at Bellwether Wealth. \"Amazon is taking steps to narrow the gap between employee headcount and the growth of its business.\"\nAmazon was arguably the darling of the pandemic era as it benefited from consumers\u2019 sudden shift to online shopping and businesses\u2019 broad move to the cloud, said Nicole Tanenbaum, partner and chief investment strategist at Chequers Financial Management. During this period, Amazon\u2019s profitability soared while the company boosted staffing and leaned into expanded offerings and markets. Amazon\u2019s headcount grew by 310,000 from 2020 to 2021, an increase of almost 25%.\nBut as the disruptions of the pandemic eased into a recovering economy,\u00a0the company\u2019s prior investment decisions collided with slowing revenue growth, a reset in consumer spending patterns, and increasing cost pressures triggered by historic inflation.\nAmazon also faced a major leadership transition. Jeff Bezos, the company\u2019s founder, whose identity is intimately tied to the company, stepped aside as CEO in 2021. Andy Jassy, the head of Amazon\u2019s lucrative and industry-leading cloud service, AWS, then took the reins.\n\u201cNot only does Jassy take a much more direct approach with regards to regulatory and political issues, he has not been afraid to admit that the company overbuilt and needed to reset its approach, lasering in on efforts to control margins and operations in the face of significant inflationary pressures,\u201d Tanenbaum said.\nFor Jassy and Amazon, rightsizing the business arrived in the form of substantial cost-cutting initiatives. The company enacted stark headcount reductions along with a hiring freeze to further control costs.\nAmazon's layoffs over the last several years amount to more than 27,000 cuts. The latest round underscores the financial pullback, especially in contrast to massive spending during peak COVID. For instance,\u00a0Amazon spent $8.5 billion to acquire MGM, the home of James Bond, in 2022. And the company is estimated to have doled out more than $1 billion to produce multiple seasons of The Rings of Power, its Lord of the Rings prequel series, and likely the most expensive show ever.\nWhile Amazon is among the largest private employers in the US, and the biggest within the tech world, several of its industry peers have turned to drastic layoffs. Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, dubbed 2023 the \"year of efficiency.\" The social media company cut more than 20,000 jobs since late 2022 to cope with declining ad revenue and to improve the business and its cost structure.\nAnd Google (GOOG, GOOGL), which has cut more than 10,000 jobs in that period, said on Thursday it is laying off hundreds of workers on its digital assistant, hardware, and engineering teams, as the search giant aims to trim costs and focus on its biggest priorities.\nThere is a chance Big Tech will bolster its ranks if the Fed starts to cut rates later this year, relaxing the more reserved posture the industry has adopted. But what\u2019s happening now to staff levels suggests otherwise, said Cory Stahle, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. After peaking in the spring of 2022, tech industry headcounts suffered a significant decline through the summer of last year. Those losses eventually flattened out and leveled off, a trend that\u2019s likely to continue, as exuberance gives way to caution.\nThe digital lives of consumers changed during the pandemic \u2014 that's undeniable. But they continue to change, along with the next chapter of the US economy.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.
