        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) dominance in e-commerce makes any potential threat hard to take seriously. On the surface anyway. But the staggering growth of direct shippers like Temu and Shein, though puny in comparison, has grabbed the attention of the people who run the everything store.\nAnd Amazon aims to confront them directly before they get much more traction.\nAmazon\u2019s reported move to start a new service focused on shipping low-cost fashion and lifestyle products directly from China highlights how bargain platforms have made inroads with American shoppers and Chinese manufacturers. And how even market leaders are forced to adjust to maintain top billing.\n\u201cThe Chinese marketplaces aren\u2019t currently a huge threat to Amazon, but they are growing, and they are nibbling away at its market share,\u201d said Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData.\nNew data underscores how thoroughly Amazon commands the e-commerce market but also suggests why propping up a bargain copycat service seems like a strategic necessity, akin to a mainstream airline launching a discount carrier to fend off the \"little guys.\"\nBy the numbers, of course, the up-and-comers look more like niche businesses compared with the Seattle mega-retailer.\nAmazon is forecast to generate more than $360 billion in 2025 from sales tied to independent sellers that use the online platform, according to a report published by eMarketer last week. That represents a 10% jump from 2024. And it\u2019s ten times higher than its closest online competitor, eBay (EBAY).\nBut even as Amazon towers above its rivals, including the likes of Walmart (see above chart), and is expected to post healthy growth, Temu\u2019s anticipated figures, for example, outshine everyone else.\nTemu \u2014 where customers can order shoes for less than $10, drones for $15, or a mattress topper for a little more than $30 \u2014 is expected to grow its third-party sales by nearly 60% next year to more than $30 billion, eMarketer estimates show. That\u2019s well above the growth forecasts of other marketplace competitors, including Walmart (WMT) and Etsy (ETSY).\nAt the moment, Temu and other low cost platforms have a catalog confined to more affordable products and basic consumer goods. \u201cBut there is a danger the overlap could grow as the marketplaces round out their offer and push into higher price points,\u201d said Saunders.\nLike other forms of online shopping or walking the aisles for sales, perceived savings have a way of loosening purses, playing off impulses, and convincing shoppers to pick up items they didn't know they needed.\nOwned by the Chinese e-commerce group PDD Holdings (PDD), Temu began operating in the US in 2022. The company has relied on an advertising blitz and subsidies to disrupt established players in China and abroad, wielding ultra-low prices to claw away market share, a model that has thrived as consumers mind their spending. PDD doesn't break out Temu sales figures. But the parent company reported revenue of $12 billion for the quarter ending in May.\nShein also has Chinese roots but is currently headquartered in Singapore. The fast-fashion juggernaut, which features $5 pajama sets and $7 yoga leggings, doesn't report its financials. But in a run-up to a potential IPO, estimates pin the company's annual revenue at more than $30 billion.\nAlongside their financial accomplishments, the two platforms have drawn political scrutiny over the way they handle sending goods to the US. Shein and Temu benefit from a tax loophole that exempts packages from tariffs if they are worth less than $800. Some lawmakers have called for an end to this trade provision, targeting Chinese companies. Almost half of the shipments that are sent over using the duty-free exemption come from China, according to a recent Congressional committee report.\nPlatforms like Shein and Temu have discovered that for some customers looking for a certain set of products, speed is less important than extraordinary value.\nFor years, Amazon has conditioned US consumers to buy unbranded goods from Chinese sellers at low prices. The company optimized for speedy delivery, developing a fulfillment network that can deliver goods in days or even hours. That\u2019s true for goods already shipped to the US from abroad and from domestic merchants. In March, for instance, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or the next day across the top 60 largest US metro areas, the company has touted.\nCustomers shopping on discount platforms, however, can buy from sellers who ship products directly from China. Since the goods aren\u2019t already sitting in stateside warehouses, the logistical journey means delivery times are measured in days and weeks. But what these transactions lose in time, they make up for in price. That\u2019s how customers can find an array of goods on Temu that are much cheaper than those sold by department stores or even Amazon. (To beat the heat, an ice maker costs around $50 on Temu, compared to roughly $80 on Amazon. And a neck fan \u2014 who doesn't need one of those? \u2014 goes for around $5 on Temu. Similar items range from $20 to $45 on Amazon.)\nThe direct shipping model works especially well for cheaper items since more of their price is attributed to cost and fees. Removing a fulfillment layer can make them significantly cheaper. That\u2019s why traditional retailers and Amazon \u2014 which offer service, convenience, and speed \u2014 typically can\u2019t match the prices of bargain apps.\nAs the discount platforms have grown their customer base, Amazon has taken notice.\nThe e-commerce leader has shared plans with Chinese sellers to launch a new shopping channel that would cater to users looking for affordable clothing and lifestyle products, as first reported by the Information's Jing Yang and Theo Wayt. The items, many of which will cost less than $20, would be shipped directly from China, with delivery as fast as nine days.\n\u201cThere is also something of a future threat in that the Chinese marketplaces are very appealing to younger generations, which Amazon also wants to recruit and retain as future shoppers,\u201d said Saunders.\nAnd it\u2019s not just customers Amazon is after.\nIn a statement to Yahoo Finance, Amazon said \u201cWe are always exploring new ways to work with our selling partners to delight our customers with more selection, lower prices, and greater convenience.\u201d\nTemu told Yahoo Finance in a statement that their direct-from-factory model streamlined the traditional retail supply chain. \"By eliminating intermediaries, we pass savings directly to consumers, offering lower prices without compromising quality,\" the company said. \"Consumers have embraced this approach by making Temu one of the most popular shopping apps in the world.\"\nShein did not respond to requests for comment.\nAmazon's planned discount storefront is also an attempt to court Chinese sellers, their flow of business, and their ad dollars, said Sky Canaves, a principal analyst at eMarketer.\n\u201cThey may individually sell small amounts, but in the aggregate, they are high. If the sellers decide to go sell elsewhere, on TikTok and Shein and Temu, if they start exploring other platforms, they are going to be spending on other platforms,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what Amazon is trying to anticipate.\u201d\nBut the supply chain mimicry and incursion into rival turf go both ways. Just as Amazon is trying to be more like Temu and Shein, the discount platforms are trying to be more like Amazon, said Juozas Kaziuk\u0117nas, founder of the market research firm Marketplace Pulse.\nBargain platforms are setting up partnerships and local warehouse programs in the US and are recruiting domestic merchants.\nTemu's efforts to recruit more Chinese sellers with US inventory, as well as local merchants, are taking a page out of the Amazon book. It's also a way to protect the company if the US government eliminates the trade provision that exempts low-cost shipments from customs duties, as the Information reported on Wednesday. While it continues to ship products directly from China, Temu is establishing a stronger base of independent US sellers.\nTemu told Yahoo Finance that qualified sellers can now handle their own logistics from local US and European warehouses. \"This enriches our product selection, reduces shipping distances, and shortens delivery times,\" the company said.\nThe broad success of Amazon\u2019s e-commerce business has also invited other major players like Walmart and Target (TGT) to build their own marketplaces with third-party sellers. And the build-out of supply chain logistics has made it easier for bands outside the US to gain a foothold, said Cayce Roy, the founder and chief executive at Standvast, an e-commerce fulfillment company, and a former vice president at Amazon.\nIn an environment where Amazon still has headroom for growth but is closer to saturation, experts say creating new revenue streams and claiming share from rivals are ways to boost growth.\nBut challenges lie ahead for taking on the discount platforms that have fortified a niche for themselves.\nIf Amazon built an identity based around rapid delivery and convenience, how will the company communicate to shoppers the upside of slower delivery?\n\u201cThis is not a natural fit for them. And they don\u2019t necessarily have an advantage,\u201d said Kaziuk\u0117nas.\nKaziuk\u0117nas also pointed to Prime Day, just around the corner, to highlight the many other shopping behaviors Amazon is trying to cater to.\n\u201cShein and Temu are not accidental. This is the one thing these apps are focused on, but for Amazon, this is going to be priority number 17,\u201d he said. \"For all of Amazon\u2019s prowess and strength, this is where they are starting from a point of weakness.\u201d\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Title": "Amazon launches its fourth-generation Graviton4 chip as competition intensifies",
        "Author": " Madison Mills    \u00b7 Host and Reporter",
        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) Web Services (AWS) is launching its fourth-generation Graviton processor, the Graviton4 chip, the company shared exclusively with Yahoo Finance.\nThe new chip promises to deliver substantial improvements in performance and efficiency, including three times the compute power and memory of its predecessor, 75% more memory bandwidth, and 30% better performance, according to Rahul Kulkarni, Amazon\u2019s director of product management for Compute and AI.\n\u201cCollectively it's delivering more price performance, which means for every dollar spent, you get a lot more performance,\u201d Kulkarni shared with Yahoo Finance at Amazon\u2019s chips lab in Austin, Texas.\nDemand for chips is growing as semiconductors continue to play a vital role in the global economy, powering nearly everything we use. The industry is currently valued at $544 billion and is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2033, driven by increasing demand for AI.\nAs a result, hyperscalers such as Amazon, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) are creating custom chips to meet their specific needs, cut costs, and offer customers more affordable options.\n\"All of these companies are spending a lot of money on developing chips,\" said Patrick Moorhead, who spent over a decade as a vice president at AMD. \"They won't talk about how much they're investing, but they have these giant R&D budgets.\"\nNvidia (NVDA) remains the dominant player in the AI chips market, with more than 80% share of the market for graphics processing units (GPUs). But there is enough demand to support multiple competitors, according to Moorhead, who currently serves as CEO and chief analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy.\nAlthough the Graviton4 chip is not an AI chip, it supports AWS's Inferentia and Trainium chips, which are focused on the technology. Trainium competes directly with Nvidia's AI chips, which are considered the fastest and most powerful in the market.\nHowever, AWS's goal is not to unseat Nvidia, Kulkarni emphasized. Instead, the cloud service provider hopes to offer a viable alternative for customers focused on price performance, which they hope will allow them to take a profitable slice of the rapidly expanding AI-driven chips market.\n\"Right now, if a customer is more focused on time to market, Nvidia-based products that we offer are a great option,\" Kulkarni said. \"There are customers for whom cost becomes a very prohibitive aspect of running their business. If they want to do more cost-optimized AI workloads like training or inference, then our Inferentia and Trainium products become a great alternative.\"\nIn addition to buying chips from makers like Nvidia, AMD (AMD), and Intel (INTC), Amazon also designs its own chips in-house. AWS currently offers two main types of chips: those designed for AI and those made for general purposes, like the Graviton4.\nIn a rare look at AWS's lab, Yahoo Finance saw AWS engineers solder and test chip designs, using software to look for performance issues and fix them on site.\nIt's one way the company says it drives down development costs.\n\u201cWe can tune the product, tune this silicon, to just focus on things that really matter for customer workloads,\u201d said Kulkarni.\nAWS has not disclosed specific pricing details for the Graviton4, but the processors are rented at $0.02845 per hour of compute power. This price-performance ratio is crucial for AWS, as it uses its proprietary chips to power its cloud infrastructure and servers.\n\"AWS customers can use Graviton4 to cut their bill for IT in half,\" said Moorhead.\nIt\u2019s not just about providing chips to customers \u2014 AWS's chips strategy is also about using all of its chip offerings to power its own efforts, including a new large language model, a potential rival to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\nMoorhead noted that while the development of chips is expensive, it can lead to substantial savings in the long run.\n\"Let's say you can save $200 a chip, and you're buying a million of them a year,\" Moorhead said. \"That adds up, and that's a lot of money that you can pour in to do that.\"\nFor investors, earnings expectations from chip development may impact company profits more than actual chip production. As AWS looks to carve out its niche by designing, testing, and validating its chips, analysts have noticed the company's growing influence in the semiconductor space.\nAnalyst earnings expectations are higher for Amazon than for Microsoft or Alphabet, and the profit margins for AWS alone reached 38% in the first quarter of 2024.\n\"AWS has a lot of credibility in the semiconductor space,\" Moorhead said. \"Ten years ago, I had questions about how a company like this could do chips when you have companies investing multiple billions of dollars to do that. But they are very good at it.\"\nThis post was updated to reflect new information from Amazon that the company prices the use of its processors per hour, not per second.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Author": "  Deborah Mary Sophia ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com (AMZN) is expected to join Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) on Thursday in reporting a surge in capital spending on artificial intelligence as Big Tech companies rush to capitalize on the booming technology.\nAmazon's stock price was up over 1% before the bell and ahead of its earnings release.\nThe e-commerce giant's capital investments - mostly for building cloud and generative AI infrastructure - is expected to have risen 43% in the second quarter to $16.41 billion, according to LSEG data. That represents a roughly $1.5 billion increase from the previous three months.\nThe steep spending is also expected to pressure Amazon's margins, outweighing benefits from cost cuts and supply chain efficiencies that are aiding the retail unit's profitability.\nThe company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has long dominated the cloud-computing market but it has been facing tough competition from Microsoft in recent quarters after the Windows maker rolled out AI-powered services to its Azure cloud business.\nIn response, Amazon has partnered with the likes of Anthropic and offered startups free credits that cover the cost of using major AI models to boost the market share of its AI platform Bedrock. It also named a new head for the AWS unit in May.\nMicrosoft and Google-parent Alphabet also said earlier this month they would plow ahead with investments even as the payoff from AI takes longer than some investors had hoped. This knocked Big Tech stocks whose valuations have soared this year on the promise of AI.\n\"Amazon's capex spend will certainly be scrutinized closely. It has been slow on the adoption of AI and is skewed towards smaller companies which have struggled in the high interest-rate environment,\" said Ben Barringer, analyst at Quilter Cheviot.\n\"We would expect AWS to start speeding things up in its AI development going forward.\"\nAmazon shares have risen about 23% this year. The stock has shed more than 6% since July 8, when it hit a record, part of a broader market selloff led by US megacaps.\nGrowth at AWS is likely to have stayed similar to the previous quarter at just over 17%, according to LSEG data.\nBut Morgan Stanley analysts said: \"AWS needs to grow 18%+ in order to ... ensure investors of AWS's (AI) positioning and its ability to generate high-teens growth through this heavy capex investment period.\"\nAs a result of the spending increase, Amazon's gross profit margin growth is expected to have slowed to 1.3% in the April-June quarter, compared with 2.6% in the previous quarter and an average of 2.7% over the past two years.\nGrowth in its North American retail business likely slowed to 8% between April and June, from 12.3% in the January-March quarter, amid signs of a wider slowdown in consumer spending and some competition from new and fast-growing Chinese players such as Temu and Tiktok Shop that are enticing more US shoppers.\nAmazon's total revenue is expected to have grown 10.6% to $148.56 billion - the slowest rise in five quarters.\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Devika Syamnath)\n"

        "Author": "  Eva Roytburg ",
        "Text": "Amazon is quietly sitting on a $46 billion product, Laura Martin, an analyst from Needham, wrote to investors Wednesday.\nIt\u2019s not Prime Day; it\u2019s not the Ring; it\u2019s not even AWS, its tremendously profitable cloud computing division.\nInstead, investors should start paying attention to Amazon\u2019s live streaming platform, Twitch, which may be relatively unknown to older generations, but has become a live-streaming staple among Gen-Z and Gen-Alpha.\nTwitch is best known for video-game streaming and is \u201cthe largest streaming platform for video gamers, by far,\u201d Martin wrote. Yet the service has expanded far beyond the gaming world.\nTwitch, Martin noted, allows Amazon access to an advertising market the company wouldn\u2019t otherwise have. Nearly two-thirds of Twitch users are men, and nearly three-quarters of them are under 34, Martin wrote. For Amazon as a whole, only 45% of its customer base is under 34, and most of them are female.\n\u201cEndemic advertisers (ie., video games & accessories) that advertise on Twitch also buy ads on AMZN as well, and many of these advertisers would not be clients of AMZN without Twitch,\u201d she adds. \u201cSimilarly, brands can buy ads in Twitch to access hard-to-reach young men, most of whom do not watch traditional TV.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just men, however. At any given moment, over 2.5 million people are watching someone stream on Twitch. The service boasted 35 million average daily users in 2022, and 1.3 trillion minutes watched on the platform that same year, according to its advertising page.\nThose startling numbers don\u2019t just come from video games: Martin likens Twitch\u2019s market dominance to that of Google\u2019s YouTube.\n\"YouTube has carved out the VOD (video on demand) space and Twitch has carved out the live-streaming space,\" Martin wrote.\nTwitch has boosted the careers of ultra-popular Gen-Z comedians: most famously,\u00a0 22-year-old Kai Cenat (who has the most followers on the platform, at 12 million), gained popularity on Twitch for his 24-hour streams and pranks. Celebrities from Drake to IceSpice have sat down on Twitch to joke with Cenat; once, Drake bet $121,000 on Cenat beating rapper 21Savage in a game of NBA 2K (Cenat lost, then broke his streaming set-up out of rage).\nThe platform has also become popular among young political commentators, such as Hasan Piker, better known as Hasanabi on Twitch, where he espouses left-wing political takes to his 2.1 million followers. On one pandemic evening in 2020, Piker streamed with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) to play Gen-Z-favorite Among Us and nearly broke the platform as 400,000 viewers scrambled to watch. As Ocasio-Cortez played, she also chatted about health care policy and bantered with the constant stream of comments from viewers.\n\u201cI think the lack of predictability on a stream is what makes it compelling,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, who still occasionally streams on Twitch, previously told the Washington Post. \u201cBeing able to be comfortable in the chaos of inviting so many people in the conversation \u2026 you need to be okay with that.\u201d\nThose who embrace the mayhem, and get popular off it, can reap sizable rewards: A data leak from 2021 suggests that the platform\u2019s top creators make $8 to $9 million a year from the platform.\nStreamers get paid through a subscription model: viewers can subscribe to their favorite content creators for a minimum of $4.99 a month to gain access to perks like access to emotes \u2013 moving emojis \u2013 badges, and ad-free viewing.\u00a0 However, the platform has undergone controversy with creators over their payouts.\nSome creators rebelled against Twitch last year after it decreased the amount of subscription revenue it allotted to Partners (content creators who meet certain criteria). The current split is 50/50, a significant decrease from the original 70/30 split that allowed creators to build livelihoods and businesses on the platform.\nTwitch later announced the Partner Plus Program, restoring the 70/30 split for only the first $100,000 earned by top-tier creators, a group that includes just the 1,066 most popular creators on Twitch\u2019s 14 million-person platform.\nSome creators still complained about the limited number of people eligible for the new Partner Plus program and the various terms and conditions. \u201cThis is so unobtainable right now based off individual and reoccurring subs\u2026this doesn\u2019t help the streamers at all,\u201d Twitch partner PaladinAmber said in response to the new program.\nSince then, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has been working overtime to restore relations with creators. In January, Clancy announced a new system: anyone with more than 100 paid subscribers would now receive 60% of the money fans pledge.\n\u201cTwitch has made some good moves to help creators make money, but it's still tough to make a living just from streaming alone,\u201d Jerome Aceti, a Minecraft Twitch streamer, told Fortune. \u201cA lot of us have to rely on ads, product promotions, and other ways to bring in income.\u201d\nAceti has only recently expanded to Twitch from Youtube, where many of his 5.41 million followers know and love him as JeromeASF.\n\u201cTwitch is about being in the moment and engaging with viewers live,\u201d Aceti said. \u201cIt used to feel more like a small, tight-knit community, but now it\u2019s this huge platform with all kinds of content and different ways to engage your fans.\u201d\nDespite its popularity, the platform has struggled with profitability, laying off 35% of its staff in January to help pay the prohibitive costs associated with supporting 1.8 billion hours of live video content monthly.\nAmazon first acquired Twitch in 2014 for about $970 million, when Twitch had a revenue of about $72 million, Martin wrote. In 2023, the website generated approximately $3 billion in revenue, according to Martin. She upgraded Amazon\u2019s price target to $210 from $205 while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. Martin\u2019s new price target is \u201cbased on the upside we calculate from Twitch.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Amazon Stock (NASDAQ:AMZN) Q2 Earnings Preview: Expect Another Exceptional Quarter",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "The second-quarter earnings season is here, and on July 25, Big Tech giant Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its financial results. As a long-term AMZN stock bull, I\u2019m confident the company\u2019s positive momentum will persist in Q2, driven by its shift to higher-margin services, advancements in AI, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), its crown jewel.\nIn this article, I\u2019ll focus on expectations for the June quarter, and I\u2019ll answer the following questions: how strongly has Wall Street projected Amazon\u2019s top and bottom-line growth? What are the main topics investors should be paying attention to? And finally, is the stock a buy before earnings day?\nOver the past few quarters, it\u2019s become clear that under CEO Andy Jassy, Amazon has shifted its focus to higher-margin services like cloud computing and advertising, moving away from first-party retail sales.\nSince taking over, Jassy has been dedicated to reducing costs, streamlining operations, and restructuring Amazon\u2019s fulfillment network by eliminating thousands of jobs. He has also maintained a strong focus on AWS,\u00a0which remains\u00a0a crucial and highly profitable segment of Amazon\u2019s business. Over the last year, these segments have become significantly more profitable, and Q1 2024 was no different.\nIn the last quarter, reported in April, Amazon impressed the market by beating expectations for EPS by 18.6% and revenues by $764 million.\nComparing Q1 2023 to Q1 2024, Amazon\u2019s operating margins have greatly improved. AWS was the highlight, as Amazon\u00a0managed to improve\u00a0its operating margin to 10.7% from 3.7% in Q1 2023, with the cloud segment reporting operating margins going from 24% to 37.6% (although this was\u00a0partly due to changing the estimated useful life of their servers). In North America, the operating margin jumped from 1.2% to 5.8%. The International segment went from -4.3% to 2.8%.\nFaced with\u00a0this shift in margins, Wall Street has raised the bar, especially regarding Amazon\u2019s bottom line. The e-commerce giant is expected to report annual EPS growth of 56% in the second quarter, with 29 analysts revising their projections upwards and only 6 downwards in the last three months.\nRegarding revenues, Amazon is expected to increase them by 10.6% to $148.64 billion compared to Q2 last year. However, this figure reflects greater skepticism, as only four analysts have revised their projections upwards, and 34 have revised them downwards.\nAccording to Amazon\u2019s management, net sales for Q2 are expected to grow between 7% and 11%, already accounting for unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Additionally, weaker consumption trends in Europe compared to the U.S. could\u00a0prove to\u00a0be a headwind.\nCompared to the consensus revenue estimate of $148.7 billion, Amazon guided net sales to be between $144 billion and $149 billion.\u00a0Analysts seem to be betting on the high end of the range, possibly signaling that the company\u2019s top-line projections are too conservative.\nBut even with the bar set high, Amazon has beaten Wall Street\u2019s EPS estimates seven times in the last 10 quarters. If it beats them again in Q2, it will be the sixth consecutive quarter topping estimates.\nIt\u2019s highly likely that analysts and investors will\u00a0focus heavily on AWS\u2019s performance. Amazon has been significantly growing AWS in recent quarters, consistently beating expectations. The company\u2019s plans to ramp up capital expenditures (CapEx) highlight the robust demand for generative AI within its cloud computing segment. In Q1 alone, Amazon spent $14 billion on CapEx, with total investments reaching $48.4 billion last year.\nA key point of interest will be how AWS defends its market share against competitors like Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) Azure and Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) Google Cloud,\u00a0both of which\u00a0have been strong performers with proprietary models.\nThere\u2019s also interest in whether enterprises\u00a0are favoring\u00a0open-source models, potentially benefiting AWS more than its competitors. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized that customers prefer to bring their models to their data instead of the other way around, differing from Azure and Google Cloud\u2019s approach.\nTwo other critical areas for investor satisfaction will be demonstrating AI\u2019s impact on revenue growth beyond AWS, particularly in Advertising, where last quarter saw a strong 24% year-over-year increase in ad sales.\nAlso, investors will closely watch Amazon\u2019s ability to execute its strategy of fast and efficient deliveries for Prime members, which aims to improve consumer experience and drive higher margins.\nLast quarter, Amazon\u00a0guided that\u00a0it expects operating income between $10 billion and $14 billion, up from $7.7 billion a year ago, including seasonal stock-based compensation expenses.\nIn my view, if Amazon delivers growth in AWS bolstered by AI, expands Advertising revenue, and improves operating income through efficient Prime deliveries, it should report a stable quarter. Historically, Amazon guides investors conservatively to avoid overpromising, suggesting little chance of disappointment this quarter. This also increases the likelihood of positive surprises. Looking back at the last five quarters, AMZN shares have typically shown a positive reaction the day after earnings results.\nWall Street is extremely bullish on Amazon stock, and it seems that the Q2 results are set to please investors. Every analyst on Wall Street covering AMZN has given it a Buy recommendation, forming a Strong Buy consensus rating. The\u00a0average AMZN stock price target among the 44 bullish analysts is $223.76 per share, suggesting upside potential of 22.6%.\nSee more AMZN analyst ratings\nAlthough analysts have set high expectations for Amazon to achieve the upper end of its Q2 guidance, given the company\u2019s conservative track record, I believe this shouldn\u2019t pose a problem. If Amazon shows investors strong AWS growth, robust revenue trends from AI investments, and a solid performance in Advertising revenue, it\u2019s likely to have a strong Q2.\nAt present, I don\u2019t foresee any obstacles that could contradict these points, making me bullish on AMZN stock before its earnings report.\u00a0In fact, management\u2019s tone last quarter was overly optimistic about the company\u2019s growth trajectory in AI, particularly with AWS, suggesting its growth story is still in its early stages.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Consumer Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other consumer cyclical stocks.\nConsumer cyclical stocks are highly correlated with the economic cycle. Ideally, you'd want to buy them near the bottom of a recession when their prices are lower, anticipating a recovery and rising consumer spending. Essentially, owning consumer cyclical stocks is a bet that the economy will be growing in the near future. This is in contrast to consumer staples, or consumer defensive, stocks which allow investors to position their portfolio to hedge losses in the case of an economic downturn.\nSince consumer cyclical stocks are riskier than their defensive counterparts, they offer higher returns and also come with the corresponding increase in risk. Additionally, while determining the risk of consumer defensive stocks might be relatively easy and off the bat calculations can be used, conducting the same exercise for cyclical stocks is trickier. Investors determine a stock's risk by calculating its beta (\u03b2), which measures the tendency of a stock to move with the broader market. Stocks with a \u03b2 greater than one are more volatile, those with a \u03b2 less than one are less volatile, and a few (like gold mining stocks) can even have a negative \u03b2 that makes their share prices move in opposition to the market.\nSo why is measuring the risk of cyclical stocks tricky? Well, research shows that investors can either rely on a 'reasonable' \u03b2 estimate of 0.7 for defensive stocks or narrow them down by stock sector to define a \u03b2 that ranges between 0.6 to 0.8. On the flip side, similar shortcuts are unadvised for calculating the \u03b2 for consumer cyclical stocks. To determine the risk of these stocks, a case by case approach that takes into account the earnings volatility of a firm and the overall business model is recommended.\nBuilding on this, consumer cyclical stocks are dependent on the business cycle for their performance. In fact, data shows that if you're able to time the business cycle, then investing in consumer staples stocks can provide an opportunity to lead all other market sectors in terms of return. The business cycle is broadly divided into four phases, the early, mid, late, and recession phases. Each phase is marked by unique economic characteristics, and research shows that consumer cyclical stocks perform the best during the first phase. This phase marks the start of a new business cycle after the previous cycle's recession phase has ended, and its biggest traits are low interest rates and an uptick in economic activity.\nResearch shows that the first phase of the business cycle is the one that features the highest sector differentiated performance, with the difference between returns spreading to 25 percentage points. The stocks that lead the returns in this period are consumer cyclical stocks since lower interest rates and an uptick in economic activity allow consumers to have higher discretionary spending and enable businesses to expand operations through easy credit. The 'hit rate' (which measures the percentage of time periods in the business cycle periods in different cycles over time where the sector outperformed) of cyclical stocks during the early phase is 100%, which ties in with the performance of consumer staples in the late stage among all seven stock market sector performance across all phases of the business cycle. In terms of average returns, consumer cyclical stocks return roughly 12% as a category, implying that individual stocks will offer higher returns as the data is influenced by outliers to a large extent.\nSince consumer cyclical stocks are dependent on business cycles to a large extent and also rely on robust consumer spending, the next step in analyzing their performance is to see how spending varies within the cycle. Estimating what stage of the business cycle we're in is a tricky process, and analysts at the investment bank Morgan Stanley have tried to do so. Their research shows that we are currently in the downturn phase of the cycle, which precedes the early stage we've talked about above. We can also try to determine the business cycle's stage ourselves. Right now, inflation is still trending above trend in America (2.6% PCE in May vs 2% preferred), first quarter GDP growth slowed down (1.6% in Q1 from 3.4% in Q4 2023), and inventories at retailers jumped by 1% annually in February. These three metrics suggest that we might be in the late stage of the business cycle which typically precedes a recession. Consumer spending slows down in the late stages of the business cycles, the downturn and the recession, and neither cycle stage bodes well for consumer cyclical stocks. A key indicator of consumer spending is consumer confidence as it indicates future economic perceptions. On this front, US consumer confidence in March, April, May, and June stood at 103.1, 97, 101.3, and 100.4, respectively. A lower value signals lower confidence, and a value under 80 can signal a recession.\nTopping our analysis, let's take a look at how consumer cyclical stocks have recently fared to check whether the conclusions we've reached above are supported by stock market performance. As a refresher, 2024 has been characterized by investors pushing forward interest rate cut expectations and seeking shelter in a few stocks characterized by their strong exposure to the artificial intelligence industry. Two of the most popular consumer staples and defensive stock indexes are those managed by the S&P. Looking at their performance over the past twelve months, these are up by 14.8% and 5.8%, respectively. This is unsurprising since the US GDP has defied expectations during this time period, as it grew by 4.9% and 3.4% in Q3 and Q4 2023 and beat analyst expectations.\nHowever, Q1 2024 GDP growth slowed down to 1.6%, which not only missed analyst estimates of 2.4% but also came with some rather ill-boding expectations for consumer cyclical stocks as spending growth slowed down from its 3.3% growth in the previous quarter to 2.5% in Q1. This figure also sat well below Wall Street's 3% estimate. The data was released in April, and the previous release which saw the 0.4% inflation reading for March outdo analyst estimates triggered a 6% drop in the consumer cyclical stock index over the next nine days. Since then, the index has gained 6.57%.\nOur Methodology\nTo select the best consumer cyclical stocks to buy, we ranked the 40 biggest consumer cyclical stocks in terms of market capitalization stocks by the number of hedge funds that had held a stake in them during Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 302\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world's largest eCommerce provider, which allows it to command a substantial market. Its market size means the firm has to keep its focus on maintaining efficiency metrics to ensure that it does not lose market share to emerging competitors. Some of the metrics that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) needs to keep its eye on are increasing the number of day deliveries, reducing costs, optimizing its fulfillment network, and improving engagement with sellers to provide them with added value. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also one of the biggest cloud computing providers in America. With considerable resources at its disposal, the firm has a robust semiconductor design division, and its partnership with AI firm Anthropic provides it with runway to make more moves in the AI sphere - particularly when it comes to developing AI chips to reduce dependence on NVIDIA's products. Finally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also relies on its vast user base to run advertisements for its customers, and like the rest of its business divisions (eCommerce and Cloud) this segment is also vulnerable to any economic slowdown that affects business spending.\nSince cost control is one of the lesser talked about aspects of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s business success, here's what Alphyn Capital had to say in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\nMy previous analysis (Q4 2022 letter) highlighted the significant growth in Amazon's fulfillment expenses since 2015, masking the true earnings potential of its retail business. Though initially costly, the recent restructuring into regional fulfillment centers has yielded lower fulfillment costs and faster shipping times, leading to increased purchase frequency, especially among Prime members.\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the consumer cyclical stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Best Consumer Cyclical Stocks To Buy Now\u00a0to see the other consumer cyclical stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other information technology services stocks.\nInformation technology (IT) services are a key component of the broader IT market, which also includes services, devices, enterprise software, and data center systems. By 2023, global IT spending had surged to over $1.3 trillion. Regionally, North America and Asia were projected to account for 66% of global IT expenditure in 2022. Meanwhile, IT services spending in Latin America has consistently held a 6% share since 2019. Cloud computing is one segment of the broader IT market that is experiencing robust growth, with end-user spending anticipated to exceed $590 billion by 2023. Projections from Mordor Intelligence indicate an increase from $0.68 trillion in 2024 to an estimated $1.44 trillion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%. This upward trend is expected to persist, with the market value approaching $2.5 trillion by 2032. These figures highlight the increasing adoption and utilization of cloud solutions across various industries.\nOn another front, the advent of 5G technology has led companies to establish networks on their premises. According to Ericsson, global 5G subscriptions are projected to exceed 5.6 billion by the end of 2029, accounting for 60% of all mobile subscriptions. Set to replace 4G by delivering ultra-fast speeds and significantly reduced latency, 5G is expected to become the leading mobile access technology by 2028. In Q1 2024 alone, 5G subscriptions surged by 160 million, bringing the total to 1.7 billion.\nAccording to Gartner's latest forecast, worldwide IT spending will reach $5.06 trillion in 2024, marking an 8% increase from 2023. This revised growth rate is up from the previous quarter's estimate of 6.8%, setting the stage for IT spending to exceed $8 trillion well before the decade's end. Additionally, spending on data center systems is anticipated to experience a significant growth surge, rising from 4% in 2023 to 10% in 2024, largely driven by preparations for generative AI. Speaking on this, John-David Lovelock, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner, said the following:\n\"Spending on IT services is projected to grow by 9.7%, surpassing $1.52 trillion and becoming the largest market tracked by Gartner. Enterprises are increasingly unable to compete with IT service firms in attracting talent with critical IT skill sets. As a result, there is a rising need for investment in consulting services over internal staffing. This year marks an inflection point, with more spending on consulting than on internal staff for the first time.\"\nMoreover, the AI industry has seen significant growth, with global funding doubling to $66.8 billion by 2021. According to a report by Precedence Research, the market will grow to approximately $2,575.2 billion by 2032, reflecting a CAGR of 19% from 2023 to 2032. Additionally, PwC\u00a0suggests that AI could contribute around $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, surpassing the current combined output of China and India. This contribution is expected to consist of $6.6 trillion from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion from effects related to heightened consumption.\nOur Methodology\nTo identify the best information technology services stocks to buy now, we utilized Insider Monkey's extensive database, which tracks 920 hedge funds as of Q1 2024.

(NASDAQ:AMZN), setting a price target of $240. This came after an extensive analysis of the U.S. e-commerce landscape, which assessed category penetration and Amazon's market share. The findings suggest that Amazon is on course to surpass Walmart as the largest U.S. retailer by 2024, with e-commerce penetration potentially exceeding 40% in the long term.\nMoreover, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is rapidly becoming a powerhouse in AI, propelled by its AWS division, which reported operating margins of over 37% in the first quarter. AWS has maintained operating margins above 30% for five consecutive quarters. Additionally, Amazon's first-quarter revenue saw a 12.5% year-over-year increase, while its adjusted EPS more than tripled.\nResearch by Insider Monkey for the March quarter of 2024 showed that 302 of the 919 hedge funds tracked held stakes in Amazon.com, Inc.

        "Author": " Edwin Roman    \u00b7 Producer, Writer",
        "Text": "Amazon's (AMZN) most anticipated deal event of the year is here.\nOn Tuesday, the e-commerce giant kicked off Prime Day, its annual two-day promotional event. Prime Day began nine years ago as a way to highlight the value of a Prime membership by offering deals and benefits for members.\n\"When it comes to Prime Day, Amazon still sets the agenda and takes the majority of sales,\" eMarketer analyst Sky Canaves told Yahoo Finance (video above). \"We expect that US consumers will spend nearly $14 billion online during these two days.\"\nLast year, Prime Day brought in $13 billion in sales, with 60% of those sales coming from Amazon, while the rest came from third-party sellers, according to eMarketer. Prime members purchased more than 375 million items during the event last year, Amazon said, making it the \"biggest Prime Day event ever.\"\nThis year's Prime Day is expected to surpass that record, though the pace of revenue growth has slowed. Nearly 80% of online shoppers anticipate the best deals of the year, according to research conducted by marketing platform Skai.\nOther retailers such as Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), and Costco (COST) have followed Amazon by offering competing deals to boost sales. For instance, during Target's Circle Week, a seven-day sale that ran July 7-13, the retailer offered members of its loyalty rewards program up to 50% off clothing, skin care, fragrance, technology, and food items.\nThe shopping events come as consumer spending continues to hold up despite concerns over a slowing US economy. As Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reported Tuesday, retail sales were flat in June, coming in better than the expected 0.3% decline.\nCanaves expects essential goods and beauty to outperform other categories.\n\"Beauty is a category where Amazon's online sales continue to outpace overall e-commerce growth for the category,\" Canaves said. \"And it's been a very strong, resilient category, and one where brands are keen to get on Amazon because so many consumers are there looking for beauty products.\"\nAmazon has been gaining share in health and beauty, one of its fastest-growing product categories. In addition to rivaling other retailers such as Ulta (ULTA) and Sephora (LVMUY), Morgan Stanley predicts Amazon will overtake Walmart as the US's top beauty retailer by 2025.\nPart of Amazon's push into beauty has been expanding its offerings. Canaves pointed out that Amazon has recently attracted more premium brands, such as Clinique and Kiehl's.\nAccording to a 2023 McKinsey & Company report, the \"premiumization\" trend in beauty and fragrance is expected to continue in the coming years. McKinsey estimates the prestige beauty category will grow 8% per year between 2022 and 2027 versus a 5% growth rate for mass beauty.\nThat's leading prestige brands who previously skipped over setting up an Amazon storefront to reconsider the marketplace.\n\"If the beauty brands aren't selling [products on Amazon], then third-party resellers will,\" she said.\nClick here for all of the latest retail stock news and events to better inform your investing strategy\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stories.\nChina and the United States continue to compete against each other as the AI boom continues to reign in the tech industry. On July 2, Reuters reported that China plans to develop 50 new national and industrial standards for artificial intelligence by 2026. The country aims to standardize systems in the artificial intelligence sector by providing thorough guidelines to companies and budding startups. Furthermore, on July 3, Reuters reported that China filed six times more patents than the United States for inventions in AI like chatbots. On a global scale, more than 50,000 patent applications were filed in the past decade, a quarter of which were filed in 2023 alone. China filed 38,000 generative AI applications between 2014 and 2023, while the United States only filed slightly over 6,200 applications during the same period. Of the total applications, ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft filed the largest number of applications. The report added that Chinese patent applications covered a wider range of sectors such as autonomous driving, publishing, and document management. South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.\nThe United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.\nWhile the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.\nOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.\nIn another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.\nAnthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.\nClaude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.\nA lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, which was sourced from Insider Monkey's proprietary database that tracks over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has become one of the best AI stories on Wall Street. The company is poised for significant growth in AI, thanks to its generative AI tools in Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as Amazon Q, Amazon Bedrock, and Amazon SageMaker. In March, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) invested an additional $2.75 billion in Anthropic, an artificial intelligence safety and research company, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. The company is leveraging Anthropic's models and just launched the Claude 3.5 Sonnet to Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic's most powerful model yet. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is twice as efficient as Claude 3 Opus and is one-fifth of its price. The new AI can perform extremely complex tasks and is well-equipped with skills in producing high-quality and authentic creative content, understanding data and contextual relationships, and developing advanced codes with sophisticated reasoning.\nAmazon is also making in-house AI chips such as the AWS Trainium, and AWS Inferentia for deep learning training of more than 100 billion parameter models. The company is on its way to becoming an AI powerhouse. AWS logged $25 billion in revenue, up 17% year-over-year. In 2023, the company spent $48.4 billion in capital expenditure. to advance its generative AI and non-generative AI workloads. As per a recent update, Amazon plans to spend more than $100 billion to fund its projects in artificial intelligence and data centers over the next decade.\nMaxim Group's managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte talked about Amazon's AI position in a recent interview on Yahoo Finance. Forte believes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is well positioned to exploit artificial intelligence at the cloud computing and fulfillment center level, especially compared to tech giants like Apple. The company is making advancements in AWS while also employing techniques to automate its operations, which is a positive sign for investors.\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was held by 302 hedge funds at the close of Q1 2024 with total stakes amounting to $60.37 billion. Of those, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $7.68 billion.\nOn July 1, Needham reiterated a buy rating on the stock and maintained its price target of $205. Analysts' median price target of $220 represents an upside of 11% from current levels.\nLakehouse Capital is also bullish on the stock. Here are some comments about AMZN from its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered an impressive quarterly result that also came in well ahead of analyst expectations. Net sales increased 13% year-on-year to $143.3 billion and operating profits increased 219% year-on-year to $15.3 billion (vs the high end of guidance at $12.0 billion). As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U.S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through.\"\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the biggest AI stories right now.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Most readers would already be aware that Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock increased significantly by 9.5% over the past month. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Amazon.com's  ROE.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.\n See our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:\n17% = US$38b \u00f7 US$217b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.17 in profit.\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nAt first glance, Amazon.com seems to have a decent ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 20% the company's ROE looks quite decent. This certainly adds some context to Amazon.com's moderate 9.4% net income growth seen over the past five years.\nWe then compared Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 15% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is AMZN fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\nGiven that Amazon.com doesn't pay any regular dividends to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Amazon.com's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) climbed higher on Wednesday, adding as much as 3.4%. As of 12:46 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 2.7%.\nThe catalyst that sent the e-commerce titan higher was a report that Amazon is increasing its already expansive one- and two-day delivery options into underserved parts of the U.S.\nAmazon is working to expand its delivery empire into the most rural parts of the U.S. in a bid to increase sales in less densely populated areas, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. In recent months, it has been working to optimize its delivery and logistics services to more quickly reach a greater percentage of the population, particularly in more out-of-the-way places.\nTo better serve rural customers, Amazon will tweak its practices, \"using hyperefficient warehouses, contracted drivers, and mom-and-pop shops,\" according to the report. The company is experiencing growing demand in more remote areas and believes that by speeding up its delivery services, it can further increase that demand.\nReaching 100% of the country simply isn't practical, but Amazon is now trying to reach roughly 90% of U.S. customers. In a statement, the company said these efforts \"will help cut delivery times for customers in smaller towns and more isolated parts of the country.\"\nWhen it comes to digital retail, Amazon has no equal, accounting for approximately 38% of U.S. online retail sales last year. For context, that's more than its next 15 largest rivals combined, according to data supplied by eMarketer.\nNot only is Amazon the leader in e-commerce, but it's also the top dog in cloud computing, controlling roughly 31% of the market in the first quarter, according to research company Canalys. This cloud dominance also gives Amazon a key advantage in the generative artificial intelligence (AI) revolution as a purveyor of cloud-based AI software and solutions. It's worth noting that AI stocks are also rallying, which likely helped fuel Amazon's rise today.\nFinally, at roughly less than 3 times sales, Amazon is attractively priced, particularly considering the multiple ways in which the company can grow. That's why Amazon stock is a buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

Its focus on streamlining its fulfillment network through regionalization efforts has yielded significant cost savings and efficiency gains. These improvements, coupled with strategic investments in automation and robotics, are expected to further enhance margins and profitability in the coming quarters. We believe the set-up for margin expansion over the coming years is compelling. Driven both by efficiency gains and growth in more profitable businesses like advertising, Amazon continues to invest strategically in innovation and expansion initiatives. These include advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, hello the development of new fulfillment centers and delivery stations, and the expansion of Prime services and digital content offerings. We believe these strategic investments are laying the groundwork for sustained growth and market leadership in the years to come and continue to hold shares in Amazon as an unhedged position.\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Momentum Stocks to Benefit from Volatility Ahead.

Its distribution strength, expanding fulfillment network, ultrafast deliveries via drones and momentum in cashierless technology are other positives.A strong global footprint, along with meaningful progress in emerging geographies like India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, the Middle East and Africa, is a plus.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon\u2019s solid Prime momentum, thanks to Prime benefits, including a strong loyalty system, customer-friendly offers, quick grocery delivery services and robust Prime Free One-Day and Prime Free Same-Day Delivery services, are constantly driving its growth in the booming e-commerce market, which, as per a report from IMARC Group, is expected to hit $183.8 trillion by 2032 by registering a CAGR of 27.2% over a period of 2024-2032.Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers on the company\u2019s e-commerce platform is a major positive for its online retail business.Growing momentum in \u2018Buy with Prime\u2019 on the back of strategic partnerships with Salesforce CRM and Shopify SHOP is helping the company gain solid traction among various merchants.AMZN\u2019s offering of same-day delivery of groceries ordered under the Fresh category of its platform is boosting customer engagement further.

In the first quarter of 2024, Amazon witnessed 11% growth in its subscription services sales, which stood at $10.72 billion.\nAmazon\u2019s expanding presence in the offline retail space on the back of an increasing number of Fresh and Whole Foods stores is helping it to compete well with retail behemoths like Walmart WMT, Target and Costco, to name a few.It recently inaugurated its second Amazon Fresh store in New Jersey. It is also set to open another Amazon Fresh store in Virginia.Amazon gears up to launch a smaller Whole Foods Market concept called Whole Foods Market Daily Shop in Manhattan.Its introduction of the smart shopping cart, called Amazon Dash Cart, powered by advanced computer vision technology, to deliver an enhanced shopping experience to its in-store shoppers, is a plus.The growing traction across Amazon Go, which is a cashierless store of the company, is a major positive.\nAmazon\u2019s near-term as well as long-term prospects are expected to benefit from strong retail strategies, which include bolstering its online and offline retail presence, distribution channels and delivery services.

The stock had hit an all-time high of $200.43 during the session.

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of the latest additions to the $2 trillion valuation club. This exclusive group comprises only five companies, but these also happen to be some of the most dominant businesses on the globe.\nWhile many in this group have strong investment cases, I believe Amazon's case is just as good, if not better, than the rest. I've got three fantastic reasons why Amazon is a strong buy now and investors should consider adding its shares to their portfolios.\nUnless you've lived under a rock, you've probably heard all about artificial intelligence (AI). A key part of AI is the computing infrastructure on which these models are run. Most companies don't want to spend the money to build their own servers, so they rent computing power from cloud computing providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nAWS is the largest cloud computing provider by market share, but competitors have been nipping at its heels with the AI boom. However, Amazon's first-quarter results may change that notion. In Q1, AWS revenue rose 17% year over year, which marks an acceleration from previous quarters. Management was very bullish on AWS' prospects and sees it as a massive growth driver for years to come.\nThis is critical, as AWS is a massive part of Amazon's profitability picture. Despite making up just 18% of Amazon's total revenue, AWS provided 62% of profits. So, if AWS continues growing at a faster pace than the rest of the company, Amazon's profits will rise at a much quicker pace -- a fantastic sign for investors.\nAlthough AWS is the main profit driver in the business, the commerce divisions have also picked up their game. Driven by the companywide effort championed by CEO Andy Jassy to become more profitable, the North American and international divisions have posted solid results.\nDivision\nQ1 2023 Operating Margin\nQ1 2024 Operating Margin\nNorth America\n1.2%\n5.8%\nInternational\n(4.3%)\n2.8%\nData source: Amazon.\nWhile that pales in comparison to AWS' 38% operating margin, these two divisions are also in a more competitive industry with tighter margins. Regardless, the improvements in these divisions are being felt, and Amazon is producing record cash flow.\nThis is only the beginning for Amazon. As margins keep improving and revenue growth continues, Amazon is slated to outperform the competition.\nAmazon has launched many successful divisions in its tenure. AWS was the most successful, but advertising is giving it a run for its money.\nIn Q1, advertising revenue was $11.8 billion, up 24% year over year, good enough for Amazon's fastest-growing division. While it's less than half the size of AWS, it's growing at a quicker pace.\nThis is just another addition to Amazon's long list of successful launches and is undoubtedly helping Amazon's profit margins in its commerce divisions, as advertising is known to be a highly profitable industry.\nAmazon also has other irons in the fire, such as its pharmacy business and various AI products. Whether these end up being the next big division is irrelevant; Amazon will continue to launch new business endeavors it sees potential in. It has a long history of success with this activity, which is a critical factor when determining the staying power of an investment.\nAmazon has a lot going for it, and I think now is just as good a time to buy as any. Investors would be wise to get in before the stock continues its upward trajectory.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Author": "  Asra Isar ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of $3 Billion Hedge Fund\u2019s Top 10 Stock Bets. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stock bets of a $3 billion hedge fund.\nCinctive Capital Management is a hedge fund specializing in long/short equity strategies. Based in New York City's Hudson Yards, its founders and industry veterans, Richard Schimel and Larry Sapanski, aim to redefine the multi-manager model with an evolved approach to portfolio management. The firm provides a multi-manager investment platform to its investors combining fundamental stock picking with proprietary quantitative tools with a focus on scrupulous risk management practices to ensure robust investment strategies. According to Schimel, \u201cCinctive is the evolution of the experiences Larry and I had over the past two decades.\u201d\nRichard Schimel and Lawrence Sapanski founded Cinctive Capital Management in 2019. Since its inception, the hedge fund's assets have nearly quadrupled. Sapanski and Schimel have worked together for 14 years. Back in 2005, Larry also co-founded Diamondback Capital, managing significant assets in financials, energy, bonds, and macro strategies. In the early 2000s, Rich Schimel and Lawrence Sapanski worked for Steve Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors. They founded Diamondback Capital Management in 2005, which managed $5.8 billion in assets. However, the firm closed in 2012 due to client withdrawals following a non-prosecution agreement related to an insider trading investigation. However, the government later dropped the agreement and Diamondback was refunded the $9 million after the conviction was tossed out.\nIn addition to managing and founding Cinctive Capital Management and the aforementioned ventures, both the Co-Founders and Co-CIOs have held many distinctive roles in the past. Richard Schimel was a Senior Managing Director and Head of Aptigon Capital at Citadel. He also served as Chief Investment Officer at Sterling Ridge Capital Management, which he founded in 2013. Schimel holds a B.A. in Economics from the University of Michigan. Larry Sapanski also brings over 30 years of investment management experience to the Cinctive family. Larry Sapanski paved a similar path for himself like his fellow Richard Schimel before co-founding Cinctive. He started a hedge fund called Scoria Capital (2013-2017) where he served as CIO, overseeing trading, risk exposures, and a best ideas portfolio. Larry Sapanski has held various trading roles at London Bishopgates International, Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank, and Morgan Stanley. Sapanski graduated from St. John's University with a B.S. in Accounting.\nAccording to the Form ADV filed on March 2024, Cinctive Capital Management disclosed that they are serving 8 clients with discretionary assets under management totaling $3,019,428,000. Their most recent 13F filing for Q4 2023 revealed managed 13F securities amounting to $1,505,809,649, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 17.76%.\nCurrently, Cinctive Capital Management has been successful in betting on artificial intelligence in energy, technology, and utility sector-related stocks as it ended the first half of the year gaining 11%. Its performance has also been noteworthy while betting in other sectors such as Financials, healthcare, and biotech thereby beating other big multi-strategy hedge funds, such as Citadel and Millennium. The successful track record at Diamondback has allowed Rich Schimel and Lawrence Sapanski to draw noteworthy interest from institutional investors for their venture, Cinctive Capital Management. This achievement comes despite the broader hedge fund industry's increased scrutiny from investors over subpar returns.\nOur Methodology\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of Cinctive Capital Management at the end of the first quarter of 2024. Schimel and Sapanski's top 5 stock picks returned an average of 11% since the end of the first quarter, vs. 4% gain for the broader indices for large-cap stocks.\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nReturn since Q1 End: 0.7%\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) provides consumer products, advertising, and subscription services through online and physical stores. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported robust results in Q1 of 2024 and\u00a0generated\u00a0revenue of $143.3 billion, up 13% year-over-year.\u00a0Recently, Needham restated a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the stock and maintained its price target of $205. Analysts\u2019 median price target of $220 represents an upside of 11% from current levels.\nRegulatory filings show that Cinctive Capital Management owned 140,892 shares in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) at the end of the first quarter of 2024 worth $25 million, representing 1.18% of the portfolio.\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, First Pacific Advisors LLC is a leading shareholder in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) with 5 million shares worth more than $239 million.\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its May 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered an impressive quarterly result that also came in well ahead of analyst expectations. Net sales increased 13% year-on-year to $143.3 billion and operating profits increased 219% year-on-year to $15.3 billion (vs the high end of guidance at $12.0 billion). As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U.S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 9th on our list of the best stocks to buy according to a $3 billion hedge fund.

While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, studying successful companies can provide valuable insights. By understanding the factors that drive these companies' growth, we can potentially make better investment decisions in the future. It's important to remember that investing involves risk, and conducting thorough research is crucial before making any investment decisions.\nInvestors frequently overlook revenue in favor of profitability when evaluating stocks. Profit is what's left over after all costs are paid. Revenue is the total amount of goods and services sold. Because it is essential to determine if a business is a growth stock or a value one, profitability is important. To learn more about growth stocks, see 12 Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024.

The S&P's broader market index produced double-digit yearly returns thirteen times between 2003 and 2023. This strong performance can be largely attributed to the phenomenal returns generated by technology stocks, which significantly boosted the overall return of the large-cap market.\nAccording to a recent estimate, the aggregate market value of the top seven S&P 500 corporations is almost double that of the Japanese market. The head of topical research and global economics, Jim Reid, cautions that this is the most concentrated the US market has ever been.\nAs interest in growth stocks increases due to the hype surrounding AI and the prospect of rate cuts, these companies' fortunes are expected to soar.

Advertising revenue surged 24% to $11.8 billion, bolstered by sponsored ads and integration into Prime Video. Retail net sales grew 13%, benefiting from enhanced delivery speeds and product variety. The company's profitability also soared, with net income reaching $10.4 billion in Q1 2024, up from $3.2 billion which was fueled by effective cost management and growth in high-margin segments like AWS and advertising.\nAWS achieved a $100 billion annual revenue run rate, underscoring its dominance in cloud computing.

        "Title": "Amazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nAmazon (AMZN) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this online retailer a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 10.5%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 58.3% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 17.9%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Amazon is 59.4%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -4.1%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 25.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 7.5%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Amazon. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.2% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Amazon a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Amazon is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Consumers also spent more on electronics and home appliances, it added.\nAdobe's numbers are not adjusted for inflation. However, it said consumer spending this year has not been driven by higher prices, but new demand. It pointed to its own data, which shows online prices have fallen for 22 months and were down 4.2% year-over-year in June.\nLast week, the Labor Department reported overall consumer prices declined 0.1% from May to June after having remained flat the previous month.\n"

        "Author": "  Greg Bensinger ",
        "Text": "By Greg Bensinger\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com (AMZN) announced a series of largely incremental refinements on Wednesday to several of its artificial intelligence products as it seeks to keep rivals at bay amid a continued investor frenzy over the technology.\nThe retailer has sought to counter a perception that competitors Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have taken a lead in developing generative AI, which can respond almost instantaneously with full sentences or pictures to complicated prompts or queries.\nThe improvements Amazon announced at its conference in New York include adding additional memory to so-called agents that automate work for businesses, so that each new request can build on prior ones, said Vasi Philomin, Amazon's vice president of generative AI.\n\"This allows agents to provide more personalized and more seamless experiences, especially for complicated tasks,\" said Philomin in an interview Tuesday.\nHe said, for instance, that the updated AI agents could remember for each subsequent request that a user prefers aisle or window seats on a flight, which was not previously possible.\nAs well Amazon said it updated the Q chatbot it announced last November to make improved suggestions for writing software code, addressing one of the more popular uses for generative AI.\nAmazon also said it made improvements to help customers of its Bedrock service, which lets businesses create applications with a range of AI models, to detect and filter out so-called hallucinations \u2014 when AI creates answers to questions or requests that may be wrong or misleading.\nHallucinations have been a nagging problem in AI systems because they breed mistrust among users. Google, for instance, was criticized earlier this year for an AI-powered search feature that, among other things, recommended users add glue to pizza sauce to ensure cheese sticks to it.\nThe new controls will help reduce the occurrence of hallucinations by about 75% for certain uses, Matt Wood, vice president of AI products at Amazon Web Services, said in an interview.\nAWS, which oversees much of Amazon's AI development, is on a pace to reach $100 billion in annual revenue, the company said in April.\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; Editing by Michael Perry)\n"

        "Author": "  Jason Collins ",
        "Text": "Amazon's artificial intelligence virtual assistant, Alexa, is now in millions of households worldwide, yet the smart technology is costing Amazon billions. Here's why Alexa is a black hole in Amazon's profits.\nIn 2014, Amazon launched its first Echo smart speaker with Amazon's innovative virtual assistant, Alexa. But it was in 2017 that the world started to pay attention to this smart speaker, and thanks to the third-party products and integrations, this smart speaker was popular across the globe.\nDon't Miss:\nAmerica's construction sites are desperate for Robots \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in a house-printing startup who\u2019s making them and be a part of a $16 trillion industry.\nDon\u2019t miss the real AI boom \u2013 here\u2019s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies.\nFor example, in May 2023, Yahoo Finance reported that the e-commerce giant Amazon had revealed to the public that it had sold more than 500 million Echo devices and continued unveiling four new Echo products. Statista found that out of all the smart speakers available in the U.S. market, an overwhelming 65% of consumers chose the Echo speakers over other brands like Google Home or the Apple HomePod. That's just in the U.S.; in the United Kingdom, around 73% of people own an Amazon Echo. So, with such stellar global sales, appearances on television, star-studded marketing, and a product that is instantly recognizable, why are these smart speakers costing Amazon billions?\nSee Also: Here\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported on the loss using unnamed sources and internal documents that revealed that between 2017 and 2021, the online retail giant had lost over $25 billion in profits from its Echo speakers and Kindles. While these smart speakers may be in millions of households, they are not being used for what Amazon had originally hoped. This is certainly not the case. During the smart speaker's launch in 2014, Amazon took a risk and sold the devices at a pittance, hoping this would move large volumes of stock, which it did. The only problem is that people were not using the devices as the brand had hoped.\nTrending: Don\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\nThe hope for these smart speakers was to encourage people to buy more goods on Amazon with the assistance of Alexa because of the \"ease\" of purchase. These hopes were dashed when the retail giant realized that people were using these smart speakers mainly for the free features like setting alarms and checking the weather. A former Amazon employee had candidly told the Wall Street Journal, \"We worried we've hired 10,000 people and we've built a smart timer.\" It wasn't just the Echo speakers and Kindle devices that have caused a financial headache for the online retailer. Other electronic devices like the Fire TV Sticks and video doorbells have also been a financial drain on the company, and the current CEO, Andy Jassy, is determined to fix this problem.\nHow is Jassy going to fix this problem? By charging a new monthly subscription that is expected to launch this summer. Because Echo devices are sold at or below cost, Jassy hopes that adding a subscription will result in an additional direct revenue stream. Amazon engineers had told the Wall Street Journal that the company is \"focused on the value we create when customers use our services, not just when they buy our devices,\" and added, \"Our Devices & Services organization has established numerous profitable businesses for Amazon and is well-positioned to continue doing so going forward.\"\nIn September last year, Amazon announced it was working on the latest Alexa. However, insider reports have revealed that neither the device nor the technology is even close to being ready due to a lack of data. This new Alexa device could be the answer to making a profit off the devices.\nRead Next:\nWill the surge continue or decline on real estate prices?

        "Title": "Jeff Bezos\u2019 famed management rules are slowly unraveling inside Amazon. Can they survive the Andy Jassy era?",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "When Amazon ordered most workers back to the office three days a week in February 2023, Pamela Hayter was not happy about the end of a popular pandemic-era arrangement.\nBut Hayter, a program manager, was bothered on a deeper level: Because the policy effectively meant that only people living near an Amazon office would be able to continue working at the company, she believed Amazon was violating one of its sacred tenets to \"hire and develop the best.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, by announcing the mandate with little warning or buy-in, Hayter believed, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy had betrayed his duty to \"earn trust,\" another important part of the Amazon code.\nAt Amazon these tenets, known as Leadership Principles, are much more than suggestions. They are a way of life that employees are judged on before they are even hired, steeped in from the moment they join, and scrupulously followed thereafter with the devotion of religious converts.\nHayter\u2019s next move was a case in point: With the help of some of the 30,000 other employees who joined an internal Slack channel she\u2019d created, she drafted a memo to lay out their concerns about the return-to-work mandate. The memo was exactly six pages long.\nLike the Leadership Principles, six-page memos (\"6-pagers,\" in Amazon lingo) are part of a unique work culture forged within the giant internet company over the years and considered as much of a contributor to Amazon\u2019s world-beating success as any blockbuster product or individual, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos himself.\nIn reality, these principles and the processes they produce are among Amazon\u2019s grandest innovations.\nThe customs and practices are widely imitated: More than a dozen books promise to teach managers the secrets to the principles and processes; consultants do brisk business helping firms import Amazon\u2019s methods into their organizations; CEOs load their emails with Amazonian axioms.\nAnd yet, as the Hayter episode shows, the Amazon Way is a fragile concept even within Amazon itself. Jassy defended the return-to-work decision as a judgment call; after all, another company leadership principle notes that \u201cleaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts.\u201d But the clash between employees and the CEO over who was being more faithful to the code reveals a growing tension that some fear could erode the pillars of the $2 trillion company.\nMore than three years after Bezos passed the CEO baton to Jassy, as Amazon recently celebrated its 30th birthday, the durability and staying power of Amazon\u2019s foundational work culture are being watched closely by many inside and outside the organization.\nFortune spoke to two dozen current and recently departed Amazon executives and managers about how the famous Amazon Way is holding up in the post-Bezos era. Many of those interviewed paint a picture of a company where the key principles and practices remain core but have become less universally agreed upon. Increasingly, some insiders say, the leadership principles have become weaponized, diluted, or applied inconsistently.\nPowerPoint presentations, once strictly verboten, now pop up occasionally. Longtime leaders who embodied the principles in their every move have moved on.\nPerhaps in response to some of these new realities, Amazon recently disseminated to employees an hourlong video course hosted by Jassy himself explaining the company\u2019s 16 leadership principles.\n\u201cThe leadership principles are not something that you just memorize or that you just study for a couple of hours, or you try once or twice and you\u2019ve got them,\u201d Jassy says in the intro. \u201cIt\u2019s something that you have to practice a lot.\u201d\nMargaret Callahan, an Amazon spokesperson, said that the company regularly updates internal resources and training, including on topics pertaining to the company\u2019s culture. She said that Amazon\u2019s culture\u2014defined by the leadership principles, a \u201cwriting culture,\u201d and working backward from customers\u2019 needs\u2014remains strong: \u201cIt\u2019s what has driven innovations such as Prime, AWS, the Kindle, Alexa, the Climate Pledge, and Project Kuiper, just to name a few.\u201d\nThe success of these products, and Amazon\u2019s continued financial growth, indicate that the company is far from facing any immediate crisis. On Thursday, Amazon will report its second-quarter financial results, with Wall Street analysts expecting double-digit revenue and profit growth.\nAs Amazon seeks to extend its dominance into the next 30 years, however, the leadership principles and special work culture will almost certainly collide with the questions that have challenged so many corporate paragons of the past: Is having a sacred playbook an asset that companies should preserve at all costs, or does it become a liability holding companies back as the world around them changes? And, perhaps more important, is there a point at which a company\u2019s size, growth, and industry-spanning tentacles make a unified culture of decision-making and inventing impossible?\nCustomer obsession.\nBias for action.\nDisagree and commit.\nThere are 16 Leadership Principles at Amazon. Any Amazon employee can recite most of them by heart (those who can\u2019t won\u2019t last very long).\nThere are also the various homegrown Amazon practices: the two-pizza rule, which holds that cross-functional, or \u201csingle-threaded,\u201d teams focused on a specific goal or project should be lean enough that two pies could suffice as a team meal. There\u2019s also a rabid attention on so-called \u201cinput\u201d metrics of a certain business\u2014think selection or price\u2014rather than output metrics such as revenue.\nAnd then there\u2019s the intense focus on written narratives, including the 6-pager, a planning document that describes in storylike fashion a goal for a business line and how to go about accomplishing it, or a new project or plan (one variant of the 6-pager is the so-called PRFAQ, written in the style of a press release announcing the hypothetical future product, and the focal point of Amazon\u2019s \u201cWorking Backward\u201d product-development approach). Before a key meeting, every single attendee sits silently and reads the memo to themself. Only then is a discussion permitted to begin in earnest.\nIt sounds almost cultlike, Amazon insiders acknowledge. But as former Amazon Prime Video boss Bill Carr notes, the payoff is that historically Amazon employees up and down the corporate ladder understand things at a \u201cgranular level.\u201d\n\u201cThe executives at Amazon are just so much more well-informed about what is going on in their company, in terms of metrics, in terms of the initiatives that teams are doing, in terms of what's working, what's not working,\u201d said Carr, who left in 2015 but is the coauthor of the book Working Backwards and cofounder of a consulting firm by the same name, which both aim to guide business leaders on how to apply Amazon\u2019s principles and practices to their own businesses.\nExecutives at Amazon brim with personal examples of the power of the leadership mottos. Ideally, multiple principles can mesh together on a project to help unleash a single breakthrough product or service.\nBeryl Tomay, a 19-year Amazon veteran and vice president of its transportation division, points to one recent success story that involved \u201cregionalizing\u201d the company\u2019s network of U.S. warehouses so that each facility serves a distinct geographic area. The multiyear project has lowered costs, led to more environmentally friendly trucking routes, and allowed customers to get their goods faster, the company has said.\nFrom brainstorming the initial idea to executing, the project called for a collection of Leadership Principles\u2014 from \u201ccustomer obsession\u201d to \u201cthinking big.\u201d Tomay reels off more of them with the zeal of a true believer: \u201cThere\u2019s a 'simplify' part [and] there's also the 'invent' part. 'Dive deep' too. Going super deep into what our topology looks like, and what our inbound inventory placement looks like.\u201d\nIf mission statements and corporate values are viewed as empty slogans within many companies, at Amazon the Leadership Principles and special practices are embraced with genuine sincerity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s critically important for an organization to have something like this if they are actually meaningful,\u201d said Stephan Meier, chair of the management division at Columbia Business School and author of the forthcoming book The Employee Advantage.\nBut, Meier adds, \u201cif it's not lived, if it's not on top of people\u2019s minds, if it doesn't have any implications of how you would make decisions or treat each other, they are completely meaningless.\u201d\nIt\u2019s precisely this warning that made some Amazon insiders uneasy with what happened a few years ago.\nOn July 1, 2021, Amazon did something it hadn\u2019t done in many years: It added two new leadership principles to its list. \u201cStrive to be Earth\u2019s best employer\u201d was one new principle. \u201cSuccess and scale bring broad responsibility\u201d was the other.\nWhen these were introduced, Amazon was facing intense media coverage over the swell of unionization efforts in its warehouse network, as well as antitrust and environmental scrutiny. And with Bezos scheduled to hand over the CEO reins a few days later, the introduction of the two new principles served as a convenient opportunity to demonstrate a company committed to progress under his successor.\nInside the company, though, the reaction among many employees was swift and brutal: \u201cThey are clearly a marketing ploy and they devalue the rest of the Leadership Principles,\u201d one former senior manager of more than 10 years who left the company recently told Fortune. \u201cTotal bullshit,\u201d opined a former longtime communications employee at Amazon who was still at the company at the time, and who summed up the new principles as \u201cplaying the reputational game versus guiding how you think.\u201d\nThe problem, explained a former Amazon vice president, is that the pair of new leadership principles are so radically different from the other 14 that it makes it tougher for employees to grasp the essence of the overall principles and to act on them. \u201cI've got to think that that\u2019s somewhat challenging for the rank and file. The fact that there are so many LPs, and the fact that these last two are so abstract,\u201d the former VP said.\nThe expansion of the number of principles has coincided with what some Amazon insiders describe as an erosion of trust in the principles, or at least in the way their colleagues understand and apply the principles, which are meant to influence everything from new-product ideation to employee evaluations.\nSeveral longtime managers told Fortune that they felt the overall intent of the leadership principles has now shifted in many situations from guidelines on how to make the right decision, to more punitive usages that come across mainly intended to point out flaws. Such weaponization of leadership rules to criticize or squash dissent has always been a reality to a certain extent. \u201cEarns trust\u201d has been especially problematic in this regard, according to some women of color, and a former Amazon VP has written about leadership principles being weaponized by leaders when \u201cthey lack the power to give orders\u201d and thus resort to \u201ca crude attempt to apply the LP not as intended, but as a way to ensure an outcome.\u201d\nEven knowing that, many who spoke to Fortune believe the issue has worsened in recent years as Amazon has hired many executives from outside the company. (Most of those who spoke to Fortune requested anonymity, either because they are not permitted to talk to the press without permission as current Amazon employees, or because they feared retaliation for speaking candidly even as former employees.) One current Amazon senior manager said they\u2019ve consistently observed bosses new to the company use the principles \u201cas weapons to put those who aren\u2019t favorites in their place,\u201d while employing other principles to build up their favorites.\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019ll hear, \u2018It\u2019s amazing you had this \u2018bias for action\u2019\u2026and other times when I believe I\u2019ve had \u2018bias for action,\u2019 they will say you weren't data-driven (from the leadership principle \u2018Dive deep\u2019) enough.\u201d\nAnother employee, a longtime AWS manager, said his superiors over the last few years frequently wielded \u201cDisagree and commit\u201d\u2014a maxim intended to prevent groupthink during project planning while ensuring unity once a plan has been agreed upon\u2014as a cudgel to quash any level of pushback.\n\u201cThe joke by the time I left [last year] was if you didn't like something, you could disagree and commit or disagree and quit,\u201d the employee said.\nCallahan, the Amazon spokesperson, said that the two new principles are as important as the others, and that they all play a role in evaluating new hires as well as the performance of current employees.\nBut there are other signs of change within the organization too. Several current managers who spoke to Fortune said that PowerPoint presentations have supplanted written narratives in some cases over the last two years\u2014not in a dominant way, but in a noticeable one nonetheless. In the Prime Video division, for example, new executives who have come to the company after long careers outside of Amazon have been known to chafe at the heavy focus on narratives.\n\u201cThere's a lot of resistance from outsiders at the executive level,\u201d one current manager said.\nAnother senior manager who worked at Amazon for 15 years said his first 13 years at the company were marked by an overwhelming amount of writing, but that in the last two years that has shifted to PowerPoint decks.\n\u201cWe have this S team that is very religious about Amazon\u2019s culture and gets it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they brought in an enormous amount of senior execs in the level or two below the S team from [other] companies and they brought in their culture and were never given a real, \u2018This is how we do things at Amazon.\u2019\u201d\nNew executives who joined right before or immediately after COVID-19 shutdowns also struggled to grasp the supreme importance of business review documents like the weekly, monthly, and quarterly business reviews that exist elsewhere in the business world but are foundational inside Amazon.\n\u201cThere's huge value in the QBR when everyone sits together and puts everything on the table,\u201d a former director-level executive who left Amazon last year said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re doing it over video and have to limit the number of attendees because there\u2019s too many people, and you\u2019re really worried about anything in there that\u2019s too sensitive to be leaked, then the QBR becomes an onerous burden.\u201d\nSome ascribe the fraying of Amazon\u2019s distinct work culture in part to the change in the CEO suite, even while acknowledging Bezos\u2019s wandering focus in this area during the final years of his tenure.\n\u201cIn the last two years, Andy should have been more attuned to this,\u201d one current Amazon manager who has spent 15 years at the company said in an interview.\nAs chief executive, Bezos for many years served as the guiding light of the Amazon Way, providing real-time lessons in how to interpret the leadership principles in different situations and how to know which ones to employ when.\nThe modeling was crucial for a set of principles which, as everyone who spoke to Fortune agreed, are often in tension with one another. How can you both \u201cdive deep\u201d while having a \u201cbias for action\u201d? How can you truly employ \u201ccustomer obsession\u201d if you also have to make sure that \u201cfrugality\u201d is core to what you do?\nBezos excelled at explaining the mental models or logic he used to arrive at a decision, says Carr. He was able to articulate the \u201cwhy\u201d as much as the \u201cwhat.\u201d\n\u201cJeff\u2019s brain just doesn\u2019t work like other people\u2019s brains,\u201d adds Carr, who experienced 15 years of firsthand observations before leaving the company in 2015, and who stressed that he could only speak about Amazon\u2019s culture as it was during his time at the company. \u201cBy learning from him, then you could start to take those paths, too, and teach people about why that\u2019s the path we would take.\u201d\nThat would be a tough act for anyone to follow, even a 27-year veteran like Jassy who once served as Bezos\u2019s \u201cshadow,\u201d a role similar to a chief of staff. That\u2019s why many who spoke to Fortune don\u2019t point to the Bezos-Jassy transition as the main fault line. The disruption caused by the pandemic, as well as the doubling of Amazon\u2019s headcount in two years, was more to blame, they say.\nThose who joined right before the pandemic, or during the madness of 2020 and 2021, had little time to learn and adapt. Learning through meeting interactions over videoconferencing, for example, was much less conducive to osmosis than in-person interactions, either planned or serendipitous run-ins, several sources said.\n\u201cThe leadership we brought in from 2019 to 2021 at the director level and above never really were educated on the Amazon culture,\u201d a senior manager of 15 years said.\n\u201cThey really struggled to understand the culture, but that wasn\u2019t on them,\u201d said another, an Amazon director-level executive who left the company recently after nearly a decade. \u201cThat\u2019s on the changing of times and remote work.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s Callahan said that for the last five years, new senior Amazon leaders at the director and vice president levels attend a three-day training on the company\u2019s culture taught by peers, and are paired with other Amazon colleagues to help them adapt to the company in other ways. However, Callahan declined to respond to questions about whether this practice was put on hold during the pandemic and, if so, for how long.\nMany longtime standard-bearers of the company\u2019s DNA have also walked away in recent years. Jeff Wilke, Bezos\u2019s longtime right hand and the CEO of Amazon\u2019s core consumer business, left in 2021; Dave Clark, a longtime head of Amazon\u2019s warehouse and delivery operations who eventually replaced Wilke, departed Amazon a little more than a year later, reportedly in part due to Jassy\u2019s hands-on managing style.\n\u201cCulture takes active architecture and work,\u201d said another former Amazon vice president who worked at the company for more than 15 years. \u201cThere was nobody else left to teach [that],\u201d the former exec added, in a nod to all the top leaders who have left the company.\nWith so much change at the top, executives like Jamil Ghani are trying to step up. The global leader of Amazon Prime joined the company eight years ago and says that providing on-the-fly lessons and guidance about the leadership principles and Amazon customs, like written narratives, is an important part of his job.\n\u201cI often tell the team that the point of your work is not the doc; that the point of your work is to create a doc that can inspire the right meeting, the right discussion,\u201d Ghani told Fortune. \u201cIn the best meetings, you actually don't even talk about the document. Everybody has the same context and information and then you have a discussion.\"\nIn the event that a leadership principle has been misinterpreted or misapplied\u2014including, as he acknowledges occasionally occurs, in situations when one is being used punitively\u2014Ghani swoops in.\n\u201cI've done this many times when it's happened or, offline, kind of follow up with a peer or somebody else and be like, 'Hey, I don't think that's quite right. And here's why,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cAnd people can have a very level-headed conversation about it.\u201d\nOne of the beauties of Amazon\u2019s leadership principles has long been that they are detailed enough to serve as North Stars but broad enough for leaders to mold them as necessary depending on the type of decision or current environment.\n\u201cThese are not processes that give you the answers,\u201d says Carr, the former head of Prime Video. \u201cThey don't tell you what to do. They don't tell you whether to turn left or turn right, or to green-light this thing or not that thing. They\u2019re management tools that give you the right frameworks to use to examine the problem.\u201d\n\u201cThink of the LPs like the Bible,\u201d a former member of Amazon\u2019s exclusive senior executive team, known as the S-team, told Fortune. \u201cAmazing how many religions are based off the same text.\u201d\nThree years into Jassy\u2019s CEO tenure, the changes are becoming increasingly clear. The question now is whether this is evidence that the magic formula is getting diluted or a sign of the framework\u2019s versatility.\nTomay, the VP of transportation, says staying nimble sometimes requires tweaking longtime practices. In the last year, she\u2019s told her teams to reserve the six-page memo for only the most important meetings and encouraged them to craft a one-pager first. If there\u2019s an alignment on the path forward after reviewing the one-pager in, say, a 30-minute meeting, that person or team will get the green light to go off and dive deep in creating a 6-pager.\n\u201cThe company has shifted and grown,\u201d she says, \u201cso you have to keep adapting.\u201d\nWith 1.5 million employees, Amazon is one of the largest employers in the world. And it has successfully expanded into lucrative markets like cloud computing, advertising, and entertainment. But with online retailers like China\u2019s Shein and Temu gaining momentum, and AI threatening to reshape the entire business landscape, Amazon\u2019s ability to adapt without losing what makes it special are sure to be tested in the years to come.\nBusiness history can provide some unifying lessons. One key one: a strong culture and DNA, anchored in principles and practices that are talked about and lived out most working days, can help stabilize\u2014even bolster\u2014an organization during periods of significant change, whether CEO transitions or massive shifts in consumer or enterprise trends.\nMeier, the Columbia Business School professor and author, points to Toyota as one legacy corporation worth studying in this regard. \u201cToyota had those very clear principles on how to treat employees and make decisions, and I think it served them really well,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a result, they sustained some of their success over transitions.\u201d\nThe auto giant, whose stock hit an all-time high in March, is 87 years old, almost three times older than Amazon.\nIt\u2019s currently on its 12th president.\nAre you a current or former Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "Title": "Should You Buy Amazon Stock Before Aug. 1?",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Technology investors are probably sitting anxious right now as second-quarter earnings linger right around the corner.\nOn the one hand, the tech sector has faired quite well so far in 2024 as artificial intelligence (AI) continues to fuel enthusiasm. But on the other hand, it's reasonable to wonder if some of the future growth pertaining to AI is already baked into valuations.\nOne stock that I've been monitoring closely as of late is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). While shares of Amazon are up 20% so far this year, the stock has traded down roughly 7% during the month of July.\nWith earnings set to publish on Aug. 1, is this an opportunity to buy the dip in Amazon?\nLet's dig into what investors should be on the lookout for as Q2 earnings near and assess if now is a good time to scoop up some shares.\nOne of Amazon's most important businesses is its cloud-computing platform, AWS. AWS competes fiercely with Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform.\nOver the last couple of years, cloud infrastructure has been introduced to its newest growth driver -- artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft made a splashy $10 billion investment in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and swiftly integrated the technology across the Azure suite.\nUnsurprisingly, Amazon followed suit and countered Microsoft with a move of its own. Specifically, the company invested $4 billion into an AI start-up called Anthropic.\nWhile investments in generative AI are exciting to read about, investors should be looking at how these relationships are impacting the business.\nThe table below breaks down Amazon's quarterly revenue trends for AWS over the last year.\nCategory\nQ1 2024\nQ4 2023\nQ3 2023\nQ2 2023\nQ1 2023\nAWS Revenue\n$25.0 billion\n$24.2 billion\n$23.1 billion\n$22.1 billion\n$21.4 billion\n% Growth Year Over Year\n17%\n13%\n12%\n12%\n16%\nData source: Investor relations.\nAfter several consecutive quarters of either decelerating or flat growth, AWS finally returned to revenue acceleration during Q1.\nAlthough this is encouraging, keep in mind that Wall Street is quite demanding. During the Q2 earnings call on Aug. 1, Amazon's management will almost certainly be peppered with questions around the prospects of AWS -- specifically, how Anthropic is influencing growth and if consistent revenue acceleration should be expected.\nAs a shareholder, I'm obviously curious to see how AWS is performing. However, as a long-term investor I am less interested in quarterly performances and more focused on Amazon's underlying capital resources.\nThe slide below illustrates Amazon's operating cash flow and free cash flow as of the trailing 12 months ended March 31.\nOver the last year, the company's operating cash flow grew by 82%, while free cash flow has gone from billions in cash burn to compounding positive results. Personally, these are the figures I will be most focused on.\nAmazon has made a number of pricey investments in generative AI, data centers, and the development of its own semiconductor chips.\nWhile it's too early to demand significant growth from any of these projects, monitoring the company's capital-allocation efforts is still important because it helps validate whether or not management is making both strategic and prudent decisions.\nAs I alluded to above, shares of Amazon have traded downward during the month of July. Sometimes a stock can experience brief buying or selling activity around the time of an earnings call if information leaks or if there is a heightened level of skepticism around what's to come. I don't think this is the case regarding Amazon's current sell-off.\nRather, I think that the current price action in Amazon is primarily attributed to a series of stock sales by Amazon founder and former CEO, Jeff Bezos.\nStock sales by founders are routine. Bezos still owns a massive position in Amazon; his current sales aren't a reason to panic.\nI think now is a good time to take advantage and buy some shares while they remain a little deflated. Amazon appears to be returning to growth in its core cloud business, and the company's cash-flow positions remain exceptionally strong.\nBut with that said, I wouldn't pour into the stock by any means. I think it's better to remain focused on the long term and use a dollar-cost averaging strategy over the course of many years.\nWhether you decide to buy some shares before Aug. 1 doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. If you have long-term conviction in Amazon's business and the company consistently generates strong financial results, then scooping up shares on a routine basis over a long-term time horizon can be a lucrative strategy regardless of when you specifically buy the stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Jeff Bezos To Sell Another $5 Billion In Amazon Shares: How Could He Spend It?",
        "Author": "  Deidre Woollard ",
        "Text": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nWhenever the billionaire founder of a company sells off some shares, eyebrows are raised. What could it mean? Is it a sign of trouble? SEC filings recently revealed that Jeff Bezos, the former CEO and current executive chair on the board of directors at Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), plans to sell 25 million shares worth approximately $5 billion. Investors may wonder if that\u2019s a bad sign, and Bezos watchers may be curious about where the money might go next.\nCheck it out: Bezos' favorite real estate platform launches a way to cash in on the private credit boom \u2014 get started for just $100.\nThe good news for investors is that Bezos isn\u2019t jumping out of Amazon. These 25 million shares represent just a tiny part of his stake in the company, which is around one billion shares. That works out to around $220 billion. Bezos might just be taking advantage of an opportunity. Amazon stock was down in 2023 and has spent much of the spring and summer on a steady upward climb, hitting a 52-week high recently. Why not celebrate by taking a little off the top? And with another successful Prime Day event under Amazon\u2019s belt, it seems like a good time to sell a little with the confidence that the rest will keep going up. Where might Jeff Bezos put $5 billion to good use?\nBezos may have earned his billions through Amazon, but he\u2019s not shy about spending them elsewhere. Aside from yachts, travel, and luxury goods, there are two main areas where we have seen Bezos devote a lot of money: real estate and investing.\nHe could always buy more real estate. He has spent $237 million on three properties on Indian Creek Island, the elite Florida area known as the Billionaire Bunker. Bezos and his fiancee, Lauren Sanchez, have decided to make the Miami area their home base. For a billionaire, no property is perfect. Like his neighbor Tom Brady, Bezos plans to make major renovations, tearing down two of the mansions he owns on the island and living in the third while he plans what is likely to be another incredible home.\nHe still owns his custom-built home on Lake Washington in Seattle and several other properties in the Washington area. And he enjoys the other Washington as well. When he bought the Washington Post, he picked up two homes in the Kalorama neighborhood, including a former textile museum, which he is completely remodeling. His New York City holdings include multiple prime Fifth Avenue building floors. No tech billionaire is caught without a Hawaii hideaway, and Bezos has one of those, too, a pristine estate in Maui. What's missing? A pied-\u00e0-terre in Paris, perhaps? A ski home in Jackson Hole, WY? The possibilities, like Bezos's wallet, are nearly endless.\nHe could and probably will invest again. Bezos doesn't just bet on himself and Amazon. He has made dozens of investments through his Bezos Expeditions investment firm, including the Washington Post and his space exploration company, Blue Origin. One of the reasons Bezos stepped down from his CEO role at Amazon was to spend more time at Blue Origin. That move paid off and accelerated the company's growth even as Bezos battled with space rival Elon Musk. Blue Origin recently filed a complaint to curb the number of rockets that SpaceX can launch from Cape Canaveral.\nBezos doesn't have to own a company to invest in it. Bezos Expeditions has strategically invested in now-public companies like Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Uber (NYSE:UBER). He is also an active venture capitalist supporting various private companies from Arrived to Wildtype. We can only imagine how many pitch decks and presentations he receives regularly, but his existing investments show he has many interests beyond space travel.\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. This platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate.\nSelling a stock is always a personal decision. If you need the money or spot a more compelling investment, this isn't a bad time to sell Amazon, especially if you have held it for a while and are ready to put those gains elsewhere. However, you should remember that, like Bezos, you may be subject to some capital gains taxes.\nAn argument could also be made that this isn't a great time to sell Amazon because it may continue to go up from here. With a thriving e-commerce empire, the power of the AWS cloud business, and Amazon's forays into generative AI, it could be argued that Amazon is just getting started. Analysts agree. According to Benzinga data, Amazon is a buy with a consensus price target of $216.7 based on the ratings of 40 analysts. Recently, Wolfe Research initiated coverage with an Outperform rating.\nWhile Amazon's next earnings results on August 1 won't give us insights into how well the latest Prime Day event did, it will provide key updates on the growth of the cloud and e-commerce businesses and other segments, including media and advertising. In Amazon's shareholder letter earlier this year, CEO Andy Jassy laid out the opportunities for Amazon, noting that even as Amazon has created a $500 billion consumer business, about 80% of the worldwide retail market segment still resides in physical stores. He also sees a massive advantage in cloud migration, growing media and advertising, and generative AI, which he said \u201cmay be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet.\u201d No stock is a sure thing, but those are some reasons that Amazon may be a hold for more than just Jeff Bezos.\nCheck Out One Of Benzinga's Top Picks for Private Market Opportunities Available Now:\nIntegris Secured Credit Fund IV\nThe fund provides a fixed annual return of 12%, payable quarterly, over a 2-year period starting April 2024 and ending April 2026.

        "Title": "Amazon (AMZN) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The market expects Amazon (AMZN) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on August 1. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis online retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +63.5%.\nRevenues are expected to be $148.63 billion, up 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amazon?\nFor Amazon, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +4.58%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\nSo, this combination indicates that Amazon will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Amazon would post earnings of $0.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.13, delivering a surprise of +36.14%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nAmazon appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\nEtsy (ETSY), another stock in the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.46 for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of -44.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $632.2 million, up 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Etsy has been revised 0.9% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of -4.81%, reflecting a lower Most Accurate Estimate.\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Etsy will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Shoppers are likely to spend roughly $14 billion during Amazon (AMZN)'s Prime Day two-day shopping event this week, according to projections from Adobe Analytics (ADBE), a firm that studies e-commerce transaction data.\nSpending at Amazon on Tuesday and Wednesday could rise 10.5% from Prime Day 2023, Adobe said.\nThe online retailer began holding Prime Day a decade ago, typically in July. Prime Day accounts for 1% to 2% of Amazon's net global sales, according to CFRA Research.\nAmazon started advertising pre-Prime Day deals in early July on clothes, back-to-school gear, wellness products and electronics, though it moved Prime Day back by five days on the calendar this year.\nAmazon said that Day 1 of its two-day Prime Day 2023 earned its biggest sales day ever, although it doesn't disclose total sales for Prime Day.\nThe $12.7 billion shoppers spent at Amazon last year during Prime Day was 6.1% more than what they spent during the 2022 event, according to Adobe.\nWhy is it important?\nAmazon's Prime Day has turned July, an otherwise slow time for retailers, into a season when shoppers look for bargains, especially on back-to-school clothing, electronics, uniforms, backpacks, dorm decorations and supplies.\nRivals Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are also launching July discounts and marketing events in a bid to beat Amazon at its own game, and capture some of the $38.8 billion that the National Retail Federation trade group projects Americans will spend on back-to-school merchandise this summer.\nFollowing years of high inflation, shoppers have delayed purchases of non-essential goods and retailers are tempting shoppers to break that habit with aggressive July discounting.\n\"We are expecting really strong momentum for back-to-school,\" said Vivek Pandya, Adobe's lead insights analyst.\nShoppers are now more willing to spend and have started to use Prime Day as a back-to-school shopping opportunity, he said.\nBy the numbers\nShoppers could spend $7.1 billion at Amazon on Tuesday alone, up 11.3% from a year earlier, Adobe said. Day 2 is expected to bring $6.9 billion in online sales, up 9.2% from a year earlier, it said.\nAdobe expects Amazon to dangle discounts of 22% on electronics, 20% on clothing, 17% on home goods and furniture and 11% on sporting goods.\nAdobe's projections are based on its analysis of data measuring transactions from previous Prime Days.\n(Reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh in Bengaluru and Arriana McLymore in New York City; Editing by Rod Nickel)\n"

        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) ended the recent trading session at $199.34, demonstrating a +0.03% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.07%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.13%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.14%.\nHeading into today, shares of the online retailer had gained 6.54% over the past month, outpacing the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 2.94% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.34% in that time.\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Amazon in its upcoming release. In that report, analysts expect Amazon to post earnings of $1.02 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 61.9%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $148.54 billion, indicating a 10.54% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.58 per share and revenue of $638.24 billion. These totals would mark changes of +57.93% and +11.04%, respectively, from last year.\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Amazon. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. As of now, Amazon holds a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nWith respect to valuation, Amazon is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 43.5. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 14.29 for its industry.\nIt's also important to note that AMZN currently trades at a PEG ratio of 1.47. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Internet - Commerce industry held an average PEG ratio of 0.96.\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 55, putting it in the top 22% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com's estimated fair value is US$309 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nAmazon.com is estimated to be 40% undervalued based on current share price of US$184\nOur fair value estimate is 40% higher than Amazon.com's analyst price target of US$221\nHow far off is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n View our latest analysis for Amazon.com \nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$77.7b\nUS$103.9b\nUS$121.0b\nUS$140.8b\nUS$155.6b\nUS$168.1b\nUS$178.7b\nUS$187.9b\nUS$196.0b\nUS$203.3b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x20\nAnalyst x10\nAnalyst x6\nAnalyst x4\nEst @ 10.45%\nEst @ 8.03%\nEst @ 6.33%\nEst @ 5.15%\nEst @ 4.32%\nEst @ 3.74%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% \nUS$72.5k\nUS$90.5k\nUS$98.4k\nUS$106.9k\nUS$110.2k\nUS$111.1k\nUS$110.3k\nUS$108.2k\nUS$105.4k\nUS$102.1k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.0t\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$203b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.1%\u2013 2.4%) = US$4.4t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.4t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$2.2t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.2t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$184, the company appears quite good value at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.034. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\nOpportunity\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\nThreat\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Net income is projected to jump 65% year-over-year to $11.13 billion from $6.75 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Wedbush analysts said 87% of advertisers who advertise on Amazon said in a recent survey that they increased spending in the second quarter compared to last year, and 91% said they plan to increase their ad spend in the third quarter.\nWhile the financial performance of Prime Day will impact Amazon's third-quarter earnings, investors may be looking for additional clues about how successful this year's 48-hour sales event was. Data from Adobe Analytics found that the event generated an estimated $14 billion in online spending across U.S. retailers, split almost evenly over the two days.\nBank of America analysts said their estimates put Prime Day's gross merchandise value around $13.4 billion, up 10% from last year and better than their projections of a 7% bump, also noting that a record number of Prime signups could help Amazon continue to gain market share in online retail.\nAmazon stock rose 1.5% on Friday, leaving it up about 20% for the year so far.\nRead the original article on Investopedia.\n"

        "Text": "US e-commerce giant Amazon has unveiled an advanced AI model designed to refine its Just Walk Out checkout technology, offering more accurate and efficient shopping experiences.\nLaunched in 2018, Just Walk Out enables customers at physical stores to purchase items without the need for traditional checkouts.\nThe upgraded Just Walk Out AI technology is set to deliver quicker receipt generation for customers, addressing complex variables such as camera obstructions and varying lighting conditions.\nThe latest Just Walk Out multi-modal foundation model improves accuracy by leveraging the previous transformer-based machine learning models and applies them to physical stores.\nThe upgraded system works a lot faster than earlier iterations and is easier for retailers to install. Shoppers simply supply their payment information, credit card or mobile wallet upon entry to a store, then shop and leave.\nThe technology can now process sensor data in unison rather than sequentially and can assess multiple inputs such as cameras and weight sensors to accurately identify the items a shopper selects.\nThe AI system employs continuous self-learning and transformer technology - a neural network architecture that processes sensor data into outputs, such as receipts for checkout-free shopping.\nThis reduces the need for frequent model retraining, even in new shopping environments, as the system continuously adapts and learns.\nTo facilitate Just Walk Out's ongoing learning, the system is trained on a 3D map of the store, understanding the placement of fixtures and products.\nIt uses an image catalogue of store merchandise to visually identify items, allowing it to recognise shopper behaviour even when faced with store layout changes.\nThis technology is currently implemented in 170 third-party locations across the US, UK, Australia and Canada, including airports, stadiums and hospitals.\nAWS Applications Just Walk Out technology vice-president Jon Jenkins said: \u201cWe will launch more Just Walk Out stores in 2024 than any year prior, more than doubling the number of third-party stores with the technology this year. As we scale, the system will continue to learn from everyday shopping scenarios and raise the bar for accuracy and convenience, delivering the benefits of AI to retailers and customers around the world.\u201d\nIn July 2024 Amazon announced plans to expand its Just Walk Out technology to the O2, a premier live entertainment and retail venue in London, UK, by the end of the year.\n\"Amazon develops new AI model for Just Walk Out technology\" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  BY HALELUYA HADERO AND CORA LEWIS ",
        "Text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 It's summertime, and the bargains seem easy at a time when many consumer prices are high.\nJuly sales events have become a seasonal revenue driver for the retail industry since Amazon launched its first Prime Day back in 2015. While consumers may be enticed by the advertised can't-miss savings on some products, personal finance experts say shoppers should be careful not to fall for potentially misleading marketing or give in to impulse buys.\nAmazon has drummed up expectations in recent weeks for its 10th Prime Day event, which will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday and is open only to customers who pay $14.99 per month, or $139 per year, to receive free shipping and other perks as Prime members.\nRival retailers tried in the past to capture some of the Prime Day excitement by offering their own discounts during the two-day event. This year, Walmart, Target, Kohl's, and newcomers TikTok Shop and Temu launched summer promotions ahead of Amazon, hoping to siphon off some of the e-commerce giant's savings-hungry shoppers. Meanwhile, Macy's will be rolling out what it calls its \u201cbest summer deals\u201d during an eight-day discount event that begins on Tuesday.\nWhy are retailers offering so many summer discounts?\nJuly sales help retailers attract customers who are looking to get a head start on back-to-school shopping, which is the industry\u2019s second-most important shopping season behind the winter holiday period. The markdowns also pull in some discretionary spending from shoppers who\u2019ve had their eyes on gadgets, household products and seasonal items, such as a bikini or a new summer dress.\nDiscounts can help retailers combat \u201ca summer lull in retail spending\u201d as consumers shift their spending to summer vacations and services, like going out to eat at restaurants, according to John Mercer, the head of global research at Coresight Research.\n\u201cIt drives a bit of excitement in that mid-year period,\" when retailers may otherwise struggle to generate more revenue, Mercer said. Companies also have relied on discounts to drive consumer spending during the recent period of inflation and high interest rates, he said.\nAmazon doesn't disclose how much revenue it pulls in from Prime Day, but it has given some indications of its success. The company said last year's event resulted in the \u201csingle largest sales day\" in the company's history, with customers purchasing more than 375 million items.\nAn estimate from market research firm Emarketer indicated Amazon's global sales on Prime Day went up to $12.5 billion in 2023. The firm forecasts sales to jump roughly 7% this year.\nAre the prices on offer really deals or something else?\nIt depends on who you ask.\nRetailers hype up their promotions to pull people in. But the New York Times-owned product review website Wirecutter published an article this month saying most of Amazon's early deals this year so far \u201cstink.\u201d\nSanta Clara University business professor Kirthi Kalyanam, who is writing a book about Amazon, said Prime Day offers have been good, historically. That's because the company was able to source discounts from well-known brands such as Apple and to incentivize third-party sellers to lower their prices by promising to feature them prominently on the Amazon website, according to Kalyanam.\nBut Prime Day discounts may matter less these days because customers are getting accustomed to the ultra-cheap products sold by Amazon competitors Shein and Temu, which were both founded in China.\n\u201cMany of (the) deals may not be as competitive compared to Temu and Shein,\u201d Kalyanam said.\nAt the same time, he noted rival retailers will most likely be looking at Amazon's prices and trying to match them overnight. Last week, he said he saw Best Buy discount two products after Amazon revealed some of its early deals.\nConsumer data company Numerator reported that a majority of the roughly 5,000 Prime Day shoppers it surveyed after last year's event saw product discounts of up to 40%. Survey respondents said they saw a quarter of items selling at a discount of 60% or more.\nSome shopping experts have said that some past Prime discounts were not as big as they appeared.\nWhat are some bargain-hunting and budgeting tips?\nIf you're watching your budget, personal finance experts say you should exercise caution before you buy.\n\u201cAvoid the false sense of urgency of manufactured holidays,\u201d advises Mark Elliot, chief customer officer at financial services company LendingClub. \u201cThe idea that \u2018The more you spend, the more you save\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s just definitionally not true.\u201d\nDan Egan, a vice president at financial advising and investment company Betterment, says shoppers should make a list of what they need before the sales begin to be intentional about purchases. He also encourages consumers to avoid shopping late at night or out of boredom.\n\u201cOnce you have a list, it\u2019s less likely you\u2019ll get distracted by things you don\u2019t need,\" Egan said. \"If that list contains almost nothing, I would say to delete the (retailers') apps off your phone for the next week or two. Or you\u2019re going to get lots of notifications.\u201d\nAny shopper already carrying a credit card balance should keep in mind that the interest paid on that balance could end up cancelling out any perceived savings from a summer sale purchase, he added.\n\u201cA deal is not a deal if you have to pay interest on it,\" Egan said.\nWhile it may make sense for shoppers to try out free or temporary memberships to qualify for the best deals during the summer sales, those programs typically charge a fee to the customer\u2019s credit card on file after a short period of time, noted Erin Witte, the Consumer Federation of America's director of consumer protection.\n\u201cSet a calendar reminder to cancel if you don't want to go through with that subscription,\u201d Witte said. \u201cThink about it right at the beginning. And remember that these companies design this product to make it easy to sign up, but more difficult to cancel.\"\nConsumer Reports also offers a few tips: Download Amazon's app, sign-up for invite-only deals available for a select group of shoppers, and join the waitlist on limited-time offers that are already sold out.\nDon't forget to shop around\nFilling up an online Amazon cart is tempting for Prime members since they are paying for access to Prime Day deals. But it\u2019s always a smart idea to compare prices across multiple websites before completing a purchase.\nUnlike Prime Day offers, Walmart\u2019s discount event this month was open to everyone. However, the company sweetened the deal for its Walmart+ members by offering them early access.\nTarget only offered discounts to shoppers enrolled in its Target Circle loyalty program and used the weeklong event to promote a new membership program that aims to rejuvenate sales and traffic.\nTikTok Shop, the e-commerce arm of the popular video-sharing app, opened its summer sales event to everyone. The event started on July 9 and runs until Wednesday.\n_______\nThe Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential.\u00a0Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nKing Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management\u2019s chief strategist, recently talked to CNBC about the latest decline in tech stocks and market rotation. Lip said that he\u2019s still bullish on tech stocks and a single event does not show a trend. However, the cause of decline in tech stocks last week was the lower-than-expected CPI data which caused investors to do some \u201cprofit taking\u201d and invest in names that can benefit \u201cmore\u201d from lower interest rates, according to the analyst. Lip noted that small-cap stocks, real estate stocks, among others, gained ground on the back of this trend.\nHowever, Lip has high expectations from the upcoming earnings reports from tech companies. He also said that July has been one of the strongest months for tech stocks. Lip, however, said that major tech companies cannot go on to post record gains and their returns are expected to \u201cfall in line with historical returns.\u201d\nLip thinks the economy is entering a \u201cGoldilocks scenario\u201d where growth is steady but not \u201chot enough\u201d to cause inflation. He reiterated his view that he expects strong earnings growth this year and in 2025, which could be a tailwind for stocks.\nAsked what would cause earnings growth of tech companies, Lip said a lot of that comes down to efficient management and strong cash piles these companies have. He also said \u201cslightly\u201d lower interest rates could also be a tailwind for the economy.\nSince Lip is bullish on tech stocks and believes major AI companies still have upside potential, we decided to take a look at the top names in his portfolio. These are the top holdings of King Lip, according to CNBC. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/ Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\nKing Lip of BakerAvenue Wealth Management has AMZN in his portfolio as of July 15.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0doesn\u2019t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled \u201cchatbot recommendations\u201d as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0strength in the application layer of AI.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) operates the world\u2019s leading e-commerce marketplace and the largest public cloud platform and has a burgeoning advertising business. We expect to see sustained margin improvement as Amazon\u2019s retail regionalization efforts are bearing fruit and as its advertising business continues to scale ahead of peers. We believe the profitability ramp is still in the early innings as the company turns its attention to improving costs. One area will be inbound shipping, where faster delivery times through reduced freight, miles and packaging can reduce waste. We also see generative AI tailwinds and infrastructure modernization driving re-acceleration in growth at AWS, further enhancing Amazon\u2019s free cash flow compounding potential. In addition, following our early 2024 ESG engagements with Amazon (after multiyear engagements) we were positively inclined to see continued improvements in labor relations (health and safety metrics, benefits and wages), as well as in environmental stewardship (climate targets, reducing packaging materials, electric delivery trucks) and innovation (commitments to responsible AI and data privacy). One of the newly announced initiatives on the retail side is consolidating deliveries into fewer boxes, which reduces packaging.\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Glenn Taylor ",
        "Text": "Amazon says more than 5 billion items now arrive the same day or next day\u2014up more than 30 percent year-over-year. And it seems the online marketplace is dead set on expanding this number even further.\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal report, Amazon\u2019s expansion of its one-to-two-day delivery capabilities is designed to further push the company into rural areas\u2014a move that could mean fewer deliveries are handled by the U.S. Postal Service.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\nUPS Levies More 'Demand Surcharges' Ahead of Holiday Volume Surge\nUK Delivery Firm Evri Recruits 8,000 Drivers After Buyout\nAmazon Now Bears Responsibility for Recall of Third-Party Items\nExpedited delivery is accelerating at Amazon. Udit Madan, vice president of Amazon Worldwide Operations, said in a Tuesday morning blog post that the e-commerce giant has expanded same-day delivery to more than 120 U.S. metro areas, a jump from the more than 110 areas the company touted on June 30.\nThis expansion involves opening smaller, optimized delivery centers closer to rural locations, using contracted drivers and partnering with small businesses for deliveries, the WSJ report said.\nAccording to data from supply chain consulting firm MWPVL International, Amazon has 1,363 total facilities in the U.S. as of the 2024 first quarter, along with 170 warehouses expected to be opened in the future. Of the future facilities, 103 are expected to be delivery stations for packages, which are smaller, local distribution centers strategically positioned for last-mile delivery.\nAmazon\u2019s rural expansion includes small cities and towns in Arizona, Minnesota, Louisiana and Texas, the WSJ report said. A prior report from the publication in May indicated that Amazon had leased, bought or announced plans for over 16 million square feet of new warehouse space in the U.S. through the first five months of the year, and that the tech titan had been leasing smaller warehouses in the rural areas.\nAn Amazon spokesperson told Sourcing Journal the rural delivery stations help cut delivery times by 50 percent for customers in these less densely populated areas. These delivery stations are generally smaller in size and handle a lower volume than the stations in urban and suburban areas.\n\u201cWe believe there are more opportunities ahead for us to continue delivering our wide selection of products even faster for our customers, regardless of location,\u201d said Amazon spokesperson Sam Stephenson. \u201cExpanding our rural delivery network will help cut delivery times for customers in smaller towns and more isolated parts of the country.\u201d\nThe WSJ\u2019s description of the expansion, with a focus on \u201ccontracted drivers and mom-and-pop shops,\u201d evokes the experimental Amazon Hub Delivery program Amazon debuted last year. For that program, Amazon has been recruiting small businesses to deliver the company\u2019s packages by paying them via a per-package fee. These mom-and-pops could deliver packages using their existing staff, vehicles and devices.\nThe company has also been building out its Amazon Shipping ground delivery service for shippers that don\u2019t already sell products on Amazon. The service, which Amazon resurrected last year, competes directly with parcel delivery firms like UPS and FedEx.\nAccording to the WSJ report, Amazon\u2019s strategy is to reduce reliance on the USPS, which has been raising rates and limiting services as it continues to attempt a financial turnaround and address recent criticisms of its delivery speed.\nBut Stephenson made it clear that the USPS \u201care valued partners\u201d of Amazon despite the WSJ report, and that \u201cassertions or speculation to the contrary are inaccurate.\u201d\nThe report said Amazon isn\u2019t trying to deliver to 100 percent of U.S. customers just yet. But it has set a target of roughly 90 percent. More than two-thirds of Amazon packages are delivered via Amazon\u2019s own logistics network in the U.S., the company says.\nThe e-commerce giant has been delivering an increasing share of its own orders. As of last year, market research firm ShipMatrix said the USPS handled about 9 percent of Amazon\u2019s packages, while UPS handled about 8 percent, both significantly down from 2019.\nAmazon has been hyping the regionalization of its fulfillment network and its contribution to its \u201cfastest Prime delivery speeds ever\u201d for more than a year now, noting that the company has constantly been able to shorten the distance of its deliveries.\nMadan said in his Tuesday blog post that in the first half of 2024, Amazon cut the distance for items traveled between its U.S. sites and the customer by nearly 10 percent compared to the year prior.\nThe network expansion isn\u2019t just about industrial real estate.\nThe May WSJ report indicated that Amazon is requiring itself and third-party merchants on its platform to hold inventory across multiple locations rather than in a few centralized places to support the regionalized approach.\nAmazon credits advanced machine learning algorithms for better predicting regional demand and improving inventory placement.\n\u201cThrough scaling this effort in the first half of the year, we increased the average number of items per box in the U.S. compared to the same period in 2023, which reduced the number of required deliveries for these items,\u201d Amazon said Tuesday morning.\n"

        "Text": "Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan reiterated a Buy rating on Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) with a price target of $250, up from $225.\nSheridan previewed Amazon\u2019s upcoming second-quarter operating results and increased his above-Street 2025 GAAP operating income estimate (now +8% above) as he noted a margin upside.\nThree central investor debates are heading into earnings, and according to the analyst, they are likely to drive incremental share price performance.\nBased on various industry checks, Sheridan said Amazon\u2019s eCommerce business remained strong in the second quarter.\nThe analyst flagged Amazon\u2019s ability to continue producing operating income margin upside.\nSheridan noted the potential for outperformance in 2025 driven by higher retail margins & a stronger contribution of advertising and also maintained a positive long-term view on international margins and expects AWS profitability to remain robust.\nSheridan also highlighted the trajectory of AWS revenue growth. The analyst expects reacceleration through 2024 as prior headwinds around optimization and workload migration turn into tailwinds, and AI workloads are a rising tailwind.\nSheridan noted room for retail margins to continue expanding, driven by operating leverage on fixed retail assets, continued progress on lowering costs, a more moderate rate of inflation of important input costs, and the high-margin contribution of growing revenue streams.\nThe analyst expects the growing scale of Amazon\u2019s advertising efforts to be an additional tailwind to reported consolidated operating income margins.\nSheridan projected fiscal 2024 revenue and operating income of $633.89 billion and $64.48 billion. The analyst expects fiscal 2025 revenue and operating income of $697.93 billion and $82.76 billion.\nRBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson reiterated an Outperform rating on Amazon with a price target of $215.\nCommentary from RBC\u2019s early July off-quarter software bus tour suggested that Amazon\u2019s GPU activity had improved through the quarter, which was encouraging, and Erickson expects management\u2019s broader AI commentary to remain bullish, though with commentary likely to stay only qualitative.\nMedia reports emerged throughout the quarter regarding Amazon shifting its orders with Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) to its next-gen chips. This could now be somewhat delayed until the impact there is decided. The bottom line is that Erickson expects the company\u2019s steady reacceleration to continue pushing back against some type of a more dire share loss thesis as a function of AI.\nErickson expects the #2 and #3 players\u2019 growth to continue outpacing but also remain focused if and as AWS gets back to the most considerable marginal dollar growth.\nSheridan projected fiscal 2024 revenue and operating income of $630.51 billion and $60.41 billion. The analyst expects fiscal 2025 revenue and operating income of $696.18 billion and $77.1 billion.\nPrice Action: AMZN shares traded lower by 1.12% to $181.16 at the last check on Tuesday.\nPhoto by ANIRUDH on Unsplash\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nMar 2022\nDeutsche Bank\nInitiates Coverage On\nBuy\nFeb 2022\nTigress Financial\nMaintains\nBuy\nFeb 2022\nCredit Suisse\nMaintains\nOutperform\nView More Analyst Ratings for AMZN\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAMAZON.COM (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Amazon Q2 Earnings Preview: Gains From eCommerce and Cloud Business, Operating Margin Upside On Analysts Radar originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is set to report its Q2 2024 earnings on Aug. 1, after the market closes. Wall Street analysts expect the e-commerce giant to post an EPS of $0.95, up from $0.63 in the year-ago period. According to data from Benzinga Pro, quarterly revenue is expected to be $137.58 billion, up from $134.38 billion in the year-ago period.\nDon't Miss Out: Can you guess which type of investments Morgan Stanley says will reach $2.7 trillion by 2027? It even offers up to 20% APY potential to accredited investors. Get up to $500 \u2014 just for making your first investment.\nThe company's stock traded around $2 per share 20 years ago. If you had invested $1,000, you could have bought 500 shares of Amazon stock. Shares are currently trading at $187.88, meaning your investment's value could have soared to $93,940. This translates to a return of 9,294%. The S&P 500 total return for the same period is 570.01%.\nAmazon has a consensus rating of Buy and a price target of $216.90 based on the ratings of 41 analysts. The price target implies a more than 15% potential upside from the current stock price.\nAccording to our Benzinga Pro report, two analysts raised their price targets on Amazon earlier this week. Bernstein increased its target from $210 to $215, reiterating its Outperform rating, while Truist Securities raised the target from $220 to $230, maintaining its Buy rating.\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market. This platform allows accredited investors to invest in commercial real estate, invest today for a 1% boost.\nAmazon has beaten consensus estimates for EPS and revenues for the last six quarters.

        "Author": "  HALELUYA HADERO ",
        "Text": "Amazon reported a boost in its quarterly profits Thursday, but the company missed revenue estimates, sending its stock lower in after-hours trading.\nThe Seattle-based tech company said it earned $13.5 billion for the April-June period, higher than the $10.99 billion industry analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated. Amazon earned $6.7 billion during the same period last year.\nEarnings per share for the second quarter came out to $1.26, higher than analysts' expectations of $1.03.\nHowever, investors reacted negatively to other results, leading Amazon shares to fall more than 6% after the closing bell. The company posted revenue of $148 billion, a 10% increase that fell slightly below analyst expectations of $148.67 billion.\nAmazon also said it expects revenue for the current quarter, which ends Sept. 30, to be between $154 billion and $158.5 billion \u2014 lower than the $158.22 billion forecast by analysts.\nAmazon boosted its spending during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep up with higher demand from consumers who became more reliant on online shopping. But as demand cooled and wider economic conditions pressured other parts of its business, the company aggressively cut costs by eliminating unprofitable businesses and laying off more than 27,000 corporate employees.\nThe cost-cutting has led to growth in profits. However, Amazon is also feeling the benefits of the buzz around generative artificial intelligence, which has helped reaccelerate its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, after it experienced a slowdown.\nThe company said Thursday that Amazon Web Services saw a 19% jump in revenue compared to the same period last year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued reacceleration in AWS growth,\u201d Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement.\nThe cloud computing unit, whose customers are mostly businesses, has been attempting to lure in more customers with new tools, including a service called Amazon Bedrock that provides companies with access to AI models they can use to make their own applications. In April, Jassy said AWS was on pace for $100 billion in annual revenue.\nBut Amazon is also expected to spend more this year to support the unit. During a call with reporters, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said the company spent more than $30 billion during the first half of the year on capital expenditures, the majority of it to boost infrastructure for AWS. It expects that to increase during the second half, he said.\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads, Olsavsky said. Among other projects, the company plans to put billions toward additional infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Mississippi, where it has secured state incentives to build two data center \u201ccomplexes.\"\n\u201cThe key for us is always to make sure that we\u2019re matching that supply and demand, and running it efficiently so we don\u2019t have excess capacity,\" Olsavsky said. \"That\u2019s not a concern right now. Our concern is more on getting the supply.\u201d\nMeanwhile, revenue for the company\u2019s core e-commerce business grew by 5%, which was more sluggish compared to recent quarters. The numbers did not include sales from Amazon\u2019s annual Prime Day discount event, which took place last month.\nOlsavsky said the company came up short on revenue growth in North America because customers were still being cautious with their spending and trading down to cheaper items.\nAmazon said sales from its advertising business \u2014 which mostly comes from ad listings on its online platform \u2014 jumped by 20%. Earlier this year, it began placing ads on movies and TV shows found on its Prime Video service to bring in extra dollars.\nLast month, Prime Video also became one of three companies to sign an 11-year media rights deal with the National Basketball Association.\nBut the company faces other challenges.\nThis week, federal regulators said Amazon was responsible for the recall of more than 400,000 hazardous products that were sold on its platform by third-party sellers and shipped using its fulfillment service.\nAmazon is also facing an antitrust lawsuit, which alleges it has been overcharging sellers and stifling competition.\nAmazon\u2019s results followed other earning reports this week from tech giants such as Microsoft, Meta and Google\u2019s corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.\n"

However, some were quick to call the latest decline in tech stocks the end of the AI-fueled rally that has pushed stock valuations to eye-popping levels. But there are some Wall Street analysts who believe this is just a short-term trend and large tech and AI stocks have a lot of room to grow. Samantha McLemore, CIO of Patient Capital, said while talking to CNBC that the \u201cbull market continues and the path of least resistance is higher.\u201d\nThe analyst said that she has been in the market for a long time and investors have been worrying about the end of the bull market since 2009, while the S&P 500 has grown over 1000% (17% per year) since then.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any end to the bull market. We do think there\u2019s a good chance we see a rotation and small caps, the laggards, do much better in the second half of the year as the Fed starts to cut rates.\u201d\nSome analysts believe the latest decline in tech stocks is yet another opportunity for long-term investors to pile into AI stocks for gains. In this backdrop, we decided to take a look at the top AI stock upgrades and downgrades this month. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc.

Net sales increased 13% year-on-year to $143.3 billion and operating profits increased 219% year-on-year to $15.3 billion (vs the high end of guidance at $12.0 billion). As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U.S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through.\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 11 Biggest AI and Tech Stock Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades in July So Far. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Prime Day is always a big shopping event for Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), as the e-commerce giant lures shoppers to its site with deals. This year's shopping event set a record for the company, with Adobe Analytics projecting shoppers spent approximately $14.2 billion on its platform during the two-day event.\nLet's look at the strong showing Amazon is seeing with Prime Day and what that could mean for the stock.\nApproximately $14.2 billion in sales on Amazon's platform would be about an 11% increase from 2023 levels, according to Adobe. That would represent a nice acceleration from the 6% growth Adobe estimated that consumers spent on its platform during its Prime Day event last year. Amazon does not disclose its actual Prime Day event sales, but did say it was a record.\nSpending per order, meanwhile, saw a nice uptick, according to Numerator. It noted that the average order on Amazon was $57.97 compared to $54.05 last year. That's an over 7% increase.\nBack-to-school spending was particularly strong, up 216% according to Adobe. This is good news for Amazon and other retailers, as it shows the consumer is back. Outside of Christmas and the winter holidays, back-to-school shopping is one of the most important shopping periods for retailers.\nThe Amazon Prime Day shopping event is estimated to represent about 1% to 2% of the company's global sales, according CFRA Research.\nFor its first quarter, Amazon saw a 7% increase in its online store sales to $54.7 billion. Meanwhile, it forecast overall revenue to grow by 7% to 11% in the second quarter. As such, a successful Prime Day, which is part of its third quarter, could help the company see accelerating growth in the back half of the year, if this is a sign of a strengthening consumer.\nIt is notable that the other parts of Amazon's business outside of online sales are growing more quickly. For example, AWS revenue grew 17% in Q1 to $25 billion, while advertising services revenue jumped 24% to $11.8 billion and third-party services climbed 16% to $11.8 billion.\nAmazon trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 41 times. While not cheap per say, it is below where the stock has typically traded at over the past few years.\nAt the same time, Amazon has not seen a strengthening consumer environment in quite some time. Record Amazon Prime Day sales don't necessarily by themselves mean the consumer is strengthening, but year-over-year retail sales for June were the strongest since last fall, according to the National Retail Federation. Meanwhile, containership port volumes saw their biggest jump in two years in May, which is an indication that retailers are expecting sales to increase.\nA strengthening consumer environment combined with the opportunity the company has with artificial intelligence (AI) within its Amazon Web Services cloud computing business and other businesses should bode well both for continued and potentially accelerating growth for Amazon. If this proves to be the case, and there are certainly hints that this is occurring, then now looks like it could be a very good time to buy the stock before other investors catch on.\nMeanwhile, Amazon has proven to be willing to make big bets and spend money to come out on top. With AI being a huge opportunity and the company still the dominant player in e-commerce, the stock is a solid option for investors over the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF.\u00a0Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nOver the past few months the market has seen a massive influx of AI-related ETFs as investors look to ride the bandwagon of AI investing. A report from Wall Street Journal in June said that all ten AI ETFs tracked by website ETF.com saw inflows this year. One major AI ETF, launched by Roundhill, saw its assets grow to $35 million from under $1 million in just two weeks.\nAmid the craze of AI ETFs, does it make sense to start investing in every new ETF? Analysts offer some guidance. A Wall Street Journal report quoted Morningstar analyst Kenneth Lamont, who said that we should look for \u201cthematic purity\u201d while investing in AI ETFs. The ETF you choose, according to the analyst, must be investing in \u201cbellwether\u201d stocks positioned to benefit from the AI industry trends.\nThere is a new AI ETF in town. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), launched earlier this month, tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, which captures the performance of AI tech companies. The index seeks exposure to three main AI categories: hardware, infrastructure, and applications. The index picks companies by assigning \u00a0AI Exposure Score, which assesses each company\u2019s relevance to AI tech. You can get exposure to AI companies focusing on data centers, LLMs, AI tech to reduce costs and improve customer experience.\nIn this article, we will discuss the top 10 holdings of this new AI ETF and see whether they have the potential to rise in the coming months and weeks. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nAlexander Supertramp / Shutterstock.com\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\nAmazon is one of the biggest holdings of KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to gain on the back of its AWS business which is set to benefit from the rise in AI spending. Mizuho recently cited a survey conducted by one of its partners which shows that AWS sales cycle is seeing acceleration. Mizuho analyst James Lee reiterated his Outperform rating on the stock and gave a $240 price target. \u00a0The survey shows that spending on AWS is expected to rise about 22% year over year in 2024, up from the previous estimate of 20%, as generative AI projects are seen at an \u201cinflection point\u201d with external models about six months away from commercial deployment.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0doesn\u2019t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled \u201cchatbot recommendations\u201d as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0strength in the application layer of AI.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now come in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the fourth-biggest holding of KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX).\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) reported better-than-expected results in the quarter, notably showing a re-acceleration in revenue growth in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment for the first time in several quarters. Equally impressive, the AWS segment saw margins increase significantly compared to the prior quarter and year, as it\u2019s growing into a more structurally profitable business. In addition, Amazon\u2019s profit margin is expanding rapidly as its e-commerce business has been re-aligned to produce real profits. Meanwhile, the ongoing mix shift to faster-growing and higher-margin businesses, like AWS and Advertising, are contributing more to the company\u2019s bottom line.\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Spencer Soper ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Paul and Rachelle Baron were an Amazon success story. The washable swim diaper they designed for their infant son quickly became a best-selling product as the online retailer\u2019s algorithm worked its magic. Satisfied parents left five-star ratings and glowing feedback, elevating the diaper in search results and steering more shoppers their way. The momentum seemed unstoppable.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUnprecedented IT Outage Cripples Businesses Around the Globe\nAirlines Start Digging Themselves Out of Epic Flight Disruptions\nZuckerberg Calls Trump \u2018Badass\u2019 Without Endorsing Him\nCanada\u2019s Immigration Minister Has a Message for Foreign Students: You Can\u2019t All Stay\nBrookfield Lines Up a 36-Year-Old Rising Star as Next Billionaire CEO\nThen one scathing review changed everything.\n\u201cThe diaper arrived used and was covered in poop stains,\u201d a shopper wrote in a review with a one-star rating. \u201cNothing could have been more disgusting!! I am assuming someone returned it after using it and the company simply did not check the item and then shipped it to us as if it was brand new. These were not small stains either. I was extremely grossed out.\u201d Worst of all, the review featured photos of the stains for all to see.\nThis wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. Amazon.com Inc. has committed to inspecting each return for issues before reselling it. But selling returned products as new is a major and growing problem, according to consultants who advise merchants how to navigate the online marketplace. When the practice spawns negative feedback, merchants say, the damage increases exponentially.\nIn interviews, two consultants said they had personal experience with returned items being sold as new and said helping clients navigate the issue has become more time-consuming. A person who spent years in Amazon\u2019s returns operation said the sheer volume of returns makes it hard for employees to thoroughly inspect products before they\u2019re restocked. Earlier this year, Amazon instituted a new policy that for the first time lets sellers instruct the company not to resell any returned products. Last month, Lesley Hensell, an e-commerce consultant who works with Amazon merchants, welcomed the new policy on LinkedIn and wrote \u201cBetter late than never!\u201d\nThe Barons told Amazon repeatedly that they weren\u2019t at fault and that the review should be taken down. Yet it remained on the site, inflicting lasting harm. The couple says they\u2019re $600,000 in debt, including a loan secured by their home that complicates the prospect of filing for bankruptcy. They make enough selling diapers to pay down debt and order more inventory, they say, but it\u2019s not a living.\n\u201cThe last four years have been an emotional train wreck,\u201d Paul Baron said. \u201cShoppers might think returning a poopy diaper to Amazon is a victimless way to get their money back, but we\u2019re a small, family business, and this is how we pay our mortgage.\u201d\nAmazon removed the review a few hours after Bloomberg published this story.\n\u201cWhen we learned about this incident four years ago, we quickly made improvements to our product returns process to prevent this type of used item being returned and sold as new,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Chris Oster said in an emailed statement. \u201cDuring the returns inspection process, our teams are instructed to open the box every single time and validate the integrity of the inner seal. We are not aware of further incidents with this type of product since these improvements were made several years ago. More recently, we have updated our policy so that no returned products of this type can be resold under any circumstances. It\u2019s extremely rare for these types of mistakes to happen, and when they do we take them very seriously to improve the experiences of customers and sellers. There is no data to suggest this was anything but an isolated incident. We have removed the negative review in question and are investigating why it was not removed previously.\u201d\nThe Barons\u2019 entrepreneurial journey began a decade ago. They had enrolled their newborn son Beauregard in swim class. But the swim diapers they purchased were too tight on his legs and had to be removed like underpants, making cleanup messy. So the Barons turned their frustration into an idea: a reusable swim diaper with snaps to make it adjustable and easy to remove.\nThey used a credit card to place their first order with a factory in China and launched Beau & Belle Littles on Amazon. Before long, the business had reached $1 million in sales. The couple appeared on the Rachael Ray Show and were profiled in Forbes. Theirs was the kind of small-business success that Amazon loves to tout, especially when regulators accuse it of hurting mom-and-pops.\n\u201cWe started this as a dream to make enough money for Rachelle to be able to stay home,\u201d Paul said. The alternative was Rachelle working as a teaching assistant, which barely covered the cost of childcare, they said.\nThe Barons were executing a plan to triple their annual sales to $3 million in 2020, when the review landed with a thud. Even though the diaper had a four-plus-star rating from hundreds of buyers, it was hard to miss the stain photos. More than 100 shoppers upvoted the damaging review as \u201chelpful,\u201d which increased its visibility. The algorithm was suddenly working against the Barons. Sales plummeted.\n\u201cIt should be common sense,\u201d Rachelle said. \u201cWhy would something like a diaper ever be put back into inventory to be resold?\u201d\nThe amount of time Amazon workers spend inspecting returns varies, depending on what the item is, according to the former employee. But on balance, a worker shouldn\u2019t spend more than a minute eyeballing each return, the person said. Employees often don\u2019t even bother opening packages if they appear to be sealed and just assume they\u2019re unused, the former worker said. But because seals are often just a sticker or zipper it\u2019s not always clear if the product is as-new, the person said.\nThe breadth of Amazon\u2019s catalog exacerbates the problem. The company sells hundreds of millions of items. An Amazon worker handling returns might see a particular product only once and never develop expertise about a given category. It might seem unlikely that a stained diaper would be resold, except that Amazon also sells fake dirty diapers as gag gifts.\nAmazon says it doesn\u2019t allow reviews that address packaging or shipping problems or product condition and damage. The guidelines appear to prohibit the stained diaper review since it suggests the item had already been used, and the Barons were hopeful that a quick note would fix things. But their emails went unanswered. Paul recalls spending hours on the phone, getting passed from one department to another. Seller support representatives acknowledged a used diaper had been mistakenly resold, but told him they couldn\u2019t take the review down, he said. The couple tried the famous jeff@amazon email that supposedly goes to founder Jeff Bezos himself. Nothing happened.\nAmazon knew reviews could be misused when it designed the system, according to a person who worked on the project. Executives realized it would be impossible to hire enough people to adjudicate every disputed review. The best remedy, they decided, was to encourage as many authentic reviews as possible so that false ones would get washed out, the person said. The company also doesn\u2019t let businesses respond to critical feedback, unlike Google and Yelp.\n\u201cThere should be a very simple appeal process where a seller can get the review removed if a used item is resold as new,\u201d said Jason Boyce, a long-time Amazon merchant who now runs a consulting business for online sellers. \u201cBut that process has been broken for a long time.\u201d\nIn the same month as the diaper review, the Barons got an email from another customer. She had ordered a swim diaper on Amazon for an upcoming lake trip and received a stained one. The customer didn\u2019t leave a critical review and just emailed the business owners directly.\n\u201cI just received one of your swim diapers via Amazon today and when I opened it looks like it had dirt or mold on the inside. Looks like it\u2019s possibly been previously used,\u201d the email said.\nRachelle responded that Amazon shouldn\u2019t resell used diapers, but sometimes it does anyway and that it was beyond their control. She offered her apologies and sent the shopper a replacement.\n\u201cIt had a stain on it, and I\u2019m not sure if it was poop or not,\u201d said Jessica Salerno, the shopper, when reached by Bloomberg. \u201cThe business owners were really great about it when I contacted them. I feel really bad this happened to them.\u201d\nFor a long time, the Barons wondered if the first review was fake, posted by a competitor bent on sabotage. Merchants have been known to buy a competitor\u2019s product solely to leave a bad review with hopes that it elevates their business\u2014a tactic known as \u201csniping.\u201d Competition among the more than 2 million sellers on the site is so fierce, merchants have even stooped to bribing Amazon workers to give their products an advantage and sandbag their competitors. One scheme for sale was a \u201ctake-down,\u201d in which critical reviews were left on a competitor\u2019s product to hurt their sales, according to a 2020 federal indictment.\nAs it turns out, the diaper review was real. Erin Elizabeth Herbert, a teacher from Redlands, California, confirmed to Bloomberg that she left it to spare other shoppers a similar experience. The diaper arrived encrusted with feces and hadn\u2019t been washed, she said. It looked as though someone used it at the beach and rinsed it in the ocean. Herbert said she got her money back from Amazon and ordered a swim diaper from a different company.\nThe Barons \u201creached out to me and said they were mortified and offered to send me a new product,\u201d she said. \u201cThey explained to me that Amazon handles all the returns and shipping. I always meant to go back and revise my review to reflect that, and life got busy and I never did.\u201d Herbert forgot all about the review until Bloomberg contacted her in June.\nThe Barons spent a year trying and failing to get the review taken down despite following Amazon\u2019s instructions on how to do so. Today, the couple is trying to salvage a once-promising business. Paul works on the side as an e-commerce consultant and Rachelle is seeking a job in logistics.\n\u201cAmazon talks a big game about helping small businesses,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut they really don\u2019t.\u201d\n(Updated with new Amazon statement.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Zombie Mall King Doesn\u2019t Want to Be a Bottom-Feeder Forever\nWhy the Nobel-Laureate Pioneer of Microfinance Risks Life in Jail\nFive Questions With Apollo Global Co-Founder Josh Harris\nTop Takeaways From Businessweek\u2019s Donald Trump Interview\nHow Trader Joe\u2019s Mini Cooler Bags Became a Viral Hit\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

(NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) moved higher throughout the second quarter as AI demand helped to reaccelerate growth in their AWS business. It looks as though the cloud business is finally past the customer cost optimization period with customers restarting their cloud migrations as well as expanding spend on AI projects. Despite the top and bottom-line improvement seen in the first quarter, the company is significantly underearning its long-term potential as it continues to reinvest aggressively in the business. With 80% of global retail sales still being done in physical stores and 85% of global IT spending still on-premises, we see a long-run way for the dominant player in the cloud, retail, and increasingly logistics and advertising space.\"\nAmazon.com, Inc.

        "Author": "  Orianna Rosa Royle ",
        "Text": "Amazon is getting more serious about its return-to-office mandate\u2014and it\u2019s now having one-on-one chats with employees who haven\u2019t spent enough time in the building.\n\u201cOver a year ago we asked employees to start coming into the office three or more days per week because we believe it would yield the best long-term results for our customers, business, and culture. And it has,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Rob Munoz told Fortune in an emailed statement.\nMunoz added that since the tech giant announced its return-to-office policy in February last year most employees are \u201cin the office more frequently.\u201d However, it\u2019s having words with those who are not.\n\u201cNow that it\u2019s been more than a year, we\u2019re starting to speak directly with employees who haven\u2019t regularly been spending meaningful amounts of time in the office to ensure they understand the importance of spending quality time with their colleagues,\" the statement concluded.\nAccording to leaked Slack messages viewed by Business Insider, Amazon employees across different teams have been set a minimum-hour obligation on in-office days. Some teams have reportedly been told that a minimum of two hours per visit is required to count as office attendance, others six.\n\"Remember when we were measured on metrics that actually mattered?\" one employee reportedly complained on Slack.\n\"Could I badge into this door 3 days per week and save myself from having to commute to the office?\" another person reportedly wrote on Slack, in reference to a back room door which doesn\u2019t track a persons exit.\nThe toughened stance comes as research shows that workers are increasingly dodging in-office mandates by scanning their badge so it looks like they came to the office, before swiftly returning home\u2014a practice known as coffee badging.\nAmazon refused to confirm where coffee badging was an issue when asked by Fortune.\nHowever, the recent crackdown comes after a year of tug-of-war with Amazon employees over where they work.\nLast year, around 30,000 employees signed a petition protesting the company\u2019s in-office mandate, and more than 1,800 pledged to walk out from their jobs to take a stand.\nBut the tech giant has since retaliated by warning workers that if they don't start showing up, they'll be shipped out: Amazon managers have been given the green light to block promotions and even fire employees who fail to show face three days a week in the office.\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t disagree and commit, it\u2019s probably not going to work out for you at Amazon,\" Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned RTO-defying workers last summer.\nAmazon is not the only firm to take a tougher stance on its in-office policy: Dell and Google have both started proving they aren\u2019t all talk when it comes to their RTO mandates by formally tracking badge swipes.\nWhat\u2019s more, a recent WFH Research study co-authored by workplace guru Nick Bloom found that frustrated managers are increasingly likely to take action against insubordinate remote workers.\nNearly a quarter of managers revealed that employees face being fired for not following RTO mandates\u2014up from 11% in 2022. Meanwhile, about 17% of respondents they\u2019ll do \u201cnothing\u201d to punish non-compliant employees\u2014down from 34% in 2022.\nHowever, firms who issue commute or quit ultimatums to staff risk being left empty-handed if remote-loving employees call their bluff.\nAs a result of its aggressive RTO order, the dating platform Grindr lost almost half of its workforce in two weeks, including most of its engineering team, causing the company to reckon with technical issues.\nMeanwhile, Twitter\u2019s (now X) operations were once put at risk when more workers than expected chose the latter option in Elon Musk\u2019s call to go \u201chardcore\u201d or quit.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Amazon sidesteps carbon offset standard Bezos helped fund",
        "Author": "  Virginia Furness ",
        "Text": "(This July 1 story has been corrected to show the companies' plans involved Abacus-certified or equivalent types of credits, not only Abacus-certified credits in paragraph 9)\nBy Virginia Furness\n(Reuters) - Amazon has become the first company to sidestep a global standard for verifying carbon offsets that was developed by a non-profit funded largely by the U.S. technology conglomerate's founder and executive chair, Jeff Bezos.\nAmazon is backing the development of a new standard that could allow the online retailer and cloud-computing provider to overcome a dearth of supply for quality-labeled offsets, enabling it to meet its target of cutting its greenhouse-gas emissions to zero on a net basis by 2040. Critics worry that the move could lead to market confusion and a compromise in the standards of carbon offsets.\nCompanies under pressure to curb their emissions can buy credits from developers of projects that absorb carbon, such as through reforestation. The market for offsets has remained small due to a limited number of projects that can verify their climate benefits.\nAmazon told Reuters it has completed work on Abacus, a framework for verifying the quality of carbon offsets in reforestation and agroforestry. Amazon developed the standard with carbon registry Verra as an alternative to one developed by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM), the world's biggest grouping of private sector and environmental groups dedicated to validating carbon offsets. Verra first announced it was developing the label with Amazon and its Abacus working group in 2022.\nBezos, through his $10 billion Earth Fund that he set up to tackle climate change, is one of ICVCM's biggest donors, having plowed at least $11 million into ICVCM and sister organization Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative since their 2021 launch.\nJamey Mulligan, Amazon's head of carbon neutralization, said in an interview that the company evaluated and supported ICVCM's work, but that it wanted a more ambitious standard.\n\"We want to ensure that every credit investment has a real, conservatively quantified and verified impact on emissions,\" Mulligan said. He declined to comment on whether Bezos was involved in Amazon's decision.\nBezos could not be reached for comment.\nAlphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce have said they plan to buy up to 20 million metric tons of Abacus-certified or other types of nature-based removal credits.\nPedro Martins Barata, co-chair of ICVCM's panel of experts, said he was worried about development of an alternative standard and that he hoped that Abacus would eventually be folded into ICVCM.\n\"Otherwise, you get again into a confusing state in the market where each set of companies will find their own standards they want to support and they will say that they're a particular type of quality,\" he said.\nMartins Barata added that ICVCM was reviewing Verra's methodology for developing carbon offsets from agroforestry and reforestation projects, and that if it approves it this could make the Abacus label compatible with ICVCM's label.\nKelley Kizzier, director of corporate action and markets at Bezos Earth Fund and a member of ICVCM's board, said Abacus is complementary rather than competitive to ICVCM. She also declined to comment on Bezos' role.\n\"What we need to focus on is generating high-integrity (offsets). There is room for lots of actors to do that,\" Kizzier said.\nThe label will be available within weeks, Verra said.\nOFFSET MARKET\nThe $2-billion market for voluntary carbon offsets has remained small amid concerns by companies and investors that the underlying projects may not curb as many emissions as they claim.\nThe market accounts for offsetting 300 million metric tons of emissions annually, according to an Environmental Defense Fund analysis of data from financial information provider MSCI. Yet only a fraction of those offsets are verified, with ICVCM's main quality label, CCP, accounting for 27 million tons.\n\"My main concern with the strategy remains with the idea that the purchase of these credits somehow 'neutralizes' Amazon's impact. I don't think it does,\" said Gilles Dufrasne, policy lead at environmental non-profit Carbon Market Watch.\nDeborah Lawrence, chief scientist at credit ratings firm Calyx Global, welcomed the label's requirement to make public data on how much carbon the projects store but said it still had questions about Abacus\u2019 ability to ensure the carbon removals are permanent.\n\"Their permanence position requires further investigation,\" she said. \"The way it is phrased is giving us pause, but their annual monitoring and making the results public are great ideas and raise the bar.\"\nAmazon generated 71.3 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2022, according to its latest sustainability report, of which 54.98 million tons came from its supply chain.\nIt will take two to three years for projects to qualify for the Abacus label because many rely on trees growing and then developers proving how much carbon they absorb.\nMulligan said Amazon could become one of the biggest carbon-credit buyers, but that it would not use them in place of the company's efforts to decarbonise its business.\nHe added that Amazon is currently reviewing more than 70 proposals from developers and expects to restore tens of thousands of hectares of degraded land.\nAny developer can apply for the Abacus label provided they meet requirements of Verra's methodology, which the Abacus working group, a team of scientists, non-governmental organizations and industry specialists helped develop.\nEron Bloomgarden, founder of Emergent, a not-for-profit organization that mobilizes private-sector funding for forest countries, said Abacus would help grow the carbon-offset market.\n\"The work of ICVCM is important but it's insufficient for the growth of the market, because what we are trying to do is solve big existential challenges like climate change and biodiversity extinction,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Virginia Furness in London; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Rod Nickel)\n"

        "Author": "  John Kingston ",
        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s earnings, released after the market close Thursday, were notable on several key points. Among them:\nWall Street\u2019s reaction was decidedly negative. At about 4:40 p.m. EDT, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock was down about 4.4%, to $175.94. It had been down 1.56% on the day to $184.07. The decrease occurred even though its earnings per share under GAAP measurements of $1.26 beat consensus forecasts by 23 cts/share, according to SeekingAlpha.\nThe negative stock market reaction was reported to be primarily driven by the company\u2019s guidance. Amazon said it expected net sales to be between $154 billion and $158.5 billion in the third quarter. But news reports said analysts had been forecasting third quarter net sales at $158.4 billion, citing Bloomberg data.\nOne piece of data not in the earnings but will likely be in the company\u2019s 10Q, yet to be filed, is a significant gain on its shares of electric vehicle maker Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), according to Tomi Kilgore of Marketwatch. Kilgore, in a commentary on Amazon\u2019s earnings, noted that Amazon owns more than 158 million shares of Rivian Automotive Inc. That stock at the end of the second quarter was $13.42, up 22.6% from where it closed at the end of the first quarter, $10.95. Kilogore noted that Amazon did disclose earlier this week that its investments in publicly traded companies were $2.525 billion at the end of the quarter. That was up from $2.117 billion at the end of the first quarter, and\u00a0 Rivian\u2019s increase in price has been a key contributor to the rise in that asset line, according to Kilgore.\nAmong the operating highlights cited by Amazon in its prepared earnings statement, the company said it \u201cdelivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever in the first half of the year.\u201d\nKey measurements showed significant growth compared to the prior year. Net product sales for Amazon were up 4.3%. Net service sales, which includes AWS, rose 4.7%. Operating income was up 91% and consolidated net income almost doubled, to $13.5 billion.\nIn North America, net sales exclusive of AWS rose to $90 billion from $82.5 billion.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Analysts on Wall Street project that Amazon (AMZN) will announce quarterly earnings of $1.03 per share in its forthcoming report, representing an increase of 63.5% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $148.63 billion, increasing 10.6% from the same quarter last year.\nThe current level reflects no revision in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\nAhead of a company's earnings disclosure, it is crucial to give due consideration to changes in earnings estimates. These revisions serve as a noteworthy factor in predicting potential investor reactions to the stock. Numerous empirical studies consistently demonstrate a strong relationship between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as a yardstick to evaluate the company's quarterly performance, scrutinizing analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics can offer a more comprehensive perspective.\nWith that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Amazon metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Net Sales- AWS' will reach $25.87 billion. The estimate points to a change of +16.8% from the year-ago quarter.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Net sales- Physical stores' reaching $5.25 billion. The estimate points to a change of +4.5% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Net sales- Online stores' at $55.76 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5.3% from the prior-year quarter.\nThe consensus estimate for 'Net Sales- Subscription services' stands at $10.84 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +9.5% from the prior-year quarter.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Net Sales- Advertising services' of $13.00 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +21.7% year over year.\nAnalysts forecast 'Net Sales- Third-party seller services' to reach $36.31 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +12.3%.\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Geographic Revenue - International' will likely reach $31.94 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +7.6%.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Subscription services Y/Y Change' will reach 9.5%. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of 14%.\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Online stores Y/Y Change' should arrive at 5.4%. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 4% in the same quarter of the previous year.\nAnalysts expect 'Third-party seller services Y/Y Change' to come in at 12.5%. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 18%.\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Headcount - Total' should come in at 1,483,446. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 1,461,000.\nAnalysts predict that the 'WW shipping costs' will reach $22.61 billion. The estimate compares to the year-ago value of $20.42 billion.View all Key Company Metrics for Amazon here>>>Shares of Amazon have experienced a change of -5.6% in the past month compared to the -0.2% move of the Zacks S&P 500 composite.

The Fund returned 2.2% net of fees and expenses for the month compared to 1.6% for its benchmark.

As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U.S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through.\"\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nAmazon.com, Inc.

        "Author": "  WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS and HALELUYA HADERO ",
        "Text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon Prime Day is here, and experts are reminding consumers to be wary of scams.\nDeceptions such as phony emails from people impersonating online retailers like Amazon are nothing new. But phishing attempts increase amid the heavy spending seen during significant sales events, whether it's Black Friday or Prime Day, according to the Better Business Bureau.\n\u201cThis is a huge moment on the retail calendar,\" Josh Planos, vice president of communications and public relations at the Better Business Bureau, previously told The Associated Press. \"And because of that, it represents an enormous opportunity for a scammer, con artist or even just an unethical business or organization to capitalize on the moment and separate folks from their hard-earned money.\u201d\nPrime Day, a two-day discount event for Amazon Prime members, kicks off on Tuesday and runs through Wednesday. In updated guidance published last week, the Better Business Bureau reminded consumers to watch out for lookalike websites, too-good-to-be-true social media ads, and unsolicited emails or calls during sales events this month.\nConsumers might need to be more vigilant this year than ever before. In June, the Better Business Bureau published a report that said it received a record number of phishing reports in 2023. Reports are also trending up so far this year, the organization said.\nMeanwhile, in a report released this month, the Israel-founded cybersecurity company Check Point Software Technologies said more than 1,230 new websites that associated themselves with Amazon popped up in June. The vast majority of them were malicious or appeared suspicious, according to Check Point.\nScott Knapp, director of worldwide buyer risk prevention at Amazon, identifies two areas that the company has seen hoaxes around come Prime Day in recent years: Prime membership and order confirmations.\nLast year, for example, more than two-third of scams reported by Amazon customers claimed to be related to order or account issues, Knapp wrote in an emailed statement. People reported getting unsolicited calls or emails saying there was something wrong with their Prime membership and seeking bank account or other payment information to reinstate the accounts, Knapp explained.\nUrging consumers to confirm an order they didn't place is also a common tactic at this time of year, he added. Scammers might pick something expensive, like a smartphone, to get attention \u2014 and again ask for payment information or send a malicious link. They might also try to lure in consumers with promises of a giveaway, or by using language that creates a false sense of urgency.\nAmazon is attempting \u201cto ensure scammers are not using our brand to take advantage of people who trust us,\u201d Knapp wrote, adding that customers can confirm their purchases and verify messages from the company on its app or website.\nAdditional scams are probably out there, but it's hard to know what form they might take before this year's Prime Day begins. Still, experts note that the same shopping scams tend to resurface year after year.\n\u201cTypically, the bones remain the same,\u201d Planos said, pointing to fake delivery scams, email phishing and other repeated methods. \u201cIt\u2019s always a ploy to separate consumers from (their) personal and payment information.\u201d\nBut online hoaxes are also constantly evolving to become more sophisticated, Planos and others warn. That means images might look more legitimate, text messages may sound more convincing and fake websites that look very similar to real shopping destinations.\nAmazon's Knapp has said that with artificial intelligence \u201cstarting to leak in,\" the scams targeting e-commerce shoppers follow the same approach but with a machine populating an email or text instead of a person.\nAccording to data from the Federal Trade Commission, consumers reported losing about $10 billion to fraud in 2023, a 14% jump from 2022. Online shopping scams were the second most-reported form of fraud, following impostor scams, the FTC said.\nBoth the FTC and Better Business Bureau provide consumers with tips to avoid scams year-round. Guidance includes blocking unwanted messages, not giving financial information to unsolicited callers and checking links before clicking \u2014 secure websites, for example, will have \u201cHTTPS\u201d in the URL, Planos notes, never \u201cHTTP.\u201d\nScammers will often pressure you to act immediately, experts say. It's important to pause and trust your gut. Experts also urge consumers to report scams to regulators.\nBeyond scams that impersonate companies or retailers, it's also important to be cautious of counterfeit products and fake reviews on the sites of trusted retailers. Just because you\u2019re shopping on Amazon, for example, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re buying from Amazon. The online shopping giant, like eBay, Walmart and others, has vast third-party marketplaces.\nThe quality and look of counterfeit products has significantly increased over recent years, Planos notes, making the activity difficult to police. A good rule of thumb is looking at the price tag \u2014 if the product is being sold for less than 75% of its year-round market rate, \u201cthat's a pretty big red flag,\u201d he says.\nSketchy sellers can show up on different platforms, including sites like Amazon, \u201call the time\u201d Planos said, urging consumers to check out companies on the Better Business Bureau's website. Like other scams, counterfeit products may increase around high spending periods.\nAmid increasing pressure to tackle counterfeit products, Amazon has reported getting rid of millions of phony products in recent years. The company said it also blocked billions of bad listings from making it on to its site. In 2023, Amazon said more than 7 million counterfeit items were \"identified, seized and appropriately disposed of.\u201d The online retailer has also filed multiple lawsuits against fake review brokers.\nAmazon notes customers can also report fake reviews and other scams on its website. If a shopper purchases a counterfeit item detected by the company, Amazon has said it will \u201cproactively contact\u201d the customer and provide a refund.\n"

        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney\nAUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Inside Amazon.com's chip lab in Austin, Texas, half a dozen engineers on a Friday afternoon put a closely guarded new server design through its paces.\nThe server was packed with Amazon's artificial intelligence chips that compete with those from market leader Nvidia, Amazon executive Rami Sinno said on Friday, during a visit to the lab.\nAmazon is developing its own processors to limit its reliance on costly Nvidia chips - the so-called Nvidia tax - that power some of the artificial intelligence cloud business at its Amazon Web Services, the main growth driver.\nThrough its homegrown chips, Amazon wants to help customers compute complex calculations and process enormous amounts of data more cheaply.\nIts rivals Microsoft and Alphabet are doing the same.\nSinno, the director of engineering for Amazon's Annapurna Labs that is a part of its cloud business AWS, said Amazon's customers were increasingly demanding cheaper alternatives to Nvidia.\nAmazon bought Annapurna labs in 2015.\nWhile the company's AI chip efforts are nascent, Amazon's workhorse chip Graviton that performs non-AI computing has been under development for nearly a decade and is on its fourth generation. The AI chips, Trainium and Inferentia, are newer designs.\n\"So the offering of up to 40%, 50% in some cases of improved price (and) performance - so it should be half as expensive as running that same model with Nvidia,\" David Brown, Vice President, Compute and Networking at AWS said on Tuesday.\nSales at AWS, which accounts for just under a fifth of Amazon's overall revenue, surged 17% to $25 billion in the January-March quarter, compared with a year earlier. AWS controls roughly a third of the cloud computing market, with Microsoft's Azure holding about 25%.\nDuring its recent Prime Day, Amazon deployed a quarter million Graviton chips and 80,000 of its custom AI chips to handle the surge in activity across its platforms, the company said.\nThe shopping event generated a record $14.2 billion in sales, according to Adobe Analytics.\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "Author": "  Orianna Rosa Royle ",
        "Text": "Want to earn the trust of your boss and peers? Sucking up to them won\u2019t do the trick, says Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.\n\u201cThey sometimes confuse it with meaning being nice to one another or having social cohesion or not challenging each other in meetings,\u201d the 56-year-old Amazon veteran said in a recent company YouTube video: \u201cI won't challenge you if you don't challenge me or this person isn't trustworthy because they challenged me in a group of people.\u201d It\u2019s a skill, he says, people often get \u201cwrong.\u201d\nOut of all of the tech giant\u2019s 16 leadership principles penned by its founder Jeff Bezos, having a foundation of trust between leaders and staff is key to psychological safety, effective collaboration, and innovation.\nIt\u2019s why trust starts with being genuine\u2014even if that means serving your boss some hard truths or owning up to your own mistakes.\n\u201cWhat we mean by earn trust is being honest, authentic, straightforward, listening intently, but challenging respectfully if you disagree,\u201d Jassy said.\n\u201cIf you think we're doing something wrong for customers of the business, speak up,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you own something and it's not going well, own it.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s a two-way street: Leaders who want to gain the trust of their team should get comfortable with being \u201cvocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing,\u201d Jassy insisted.\nSpeaking up in meetings is crucial for earning trust, but Jassy notes that it\u2019s not enough on its own. You've got to back up your words with action and data to really make them count.\n\u201cIf you say you've got something, deliver it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you think we're not as good as we're saying we are, benchmark it, use data, and show us that we're not as good, and vice versa.\u201d\nJassy shared an example from his days leading Amazon\u2019s marketing team in the early 2000s.\nWhile he was presenting a 220-slide PowerPoint on the team\u2019s operating plan to Bezos and other execs, Bezos interrupted him just 10 slides in and said, \u201cAll of your numbers are wrong on this slide.\u201d\n\u201cI was taken aback,\u201d Jassy recalled, before adding that he quickly realized the Amazon founder was, in fact, correct.\nInstead of being \u201cresentful or mad at Jeff for pointing that out,\u201d Jassy said, he used that moment to hold his hands up, show accountability, and earn his boss's trust.\nIt clearly worked: Bezos eventually promoted Jassy to be one of his top advisors, before naming Jassy to succeed him as CEO in 2020.\n\u201cI earned trust by owning it, being vocally self-critical, and actually getting better and improving it and providing a much better presentation and account for what was truth the next time I presented in a much broader group,\u201d the CEO concluded.\nIt\u2019s not just Jassy who champions on-the-job authenticity. Jeroen Temmerman, CEO of the hair tech giant GHD, recently echoed to Fortune that it\u2019s crucial to bagging a top job like his.\n\u201cAs a leader, you need to talk to people that are in the same kind of situations that you are in\u2014not with a double agenda\u2014just like, how did you solve that problem? Because I have this problem,\u201d he said.\nBut, as CEOs and experts tell Fortune, bringing too much of yourself to work can backfire.\n\u201cAs long as you're at work, your authenticity doesn\u2019t need to be on full blast,\u201d says Tanya Slyvkin, CEO of WhitePage, the presentation consultancy.\nShe says that showing too much of your bubbly personality can signal that you can\u2019t handle difficult decisions\u2014especially if you\u2019re in a leadership role.\n\u201cImagine if I decided to get all goofy and playful at work,\u201d Slyvkin adds. \u201cHigh chances are, people wouldn\u2019t take me seriously.\u201d\n\u201cAny attempt to be 100% your authentic self at all times is a dangerous idea,\u201d agrees James Dale, CEO at SINE Digital, the performance marketing agency.\n\u201cYou have to study your own personality and work out what to bring and what not to bring to a role based on the personalities of the people that you will be interacting with, both colleagues and clients,\u201d he advises.\nUltimately, humans are multifaceted, and chances are there are aspects of your personality that you can adapt to your environment. For example, if you\u2019re trying to pitching to a new-age meat alternative, declaring how much you love the real deal probably won\u2019t do you any favors.\nIt\u2019s why Katleen De Stobbeleir, professor of leadership at the prestigious Vlerick Business School in Belgium, says it\u2019s important to make the distinction between being authentic versus simply expressing your emotions or opinions.\n\u201cReacting impulsively\u2014such as shouting\u2014because a comment upsets you isn\u2019t necessarily authentic,\u201d she says, adding that people who act like that at work way may appear impulsive, untrustworthy, and unpredictable.\n\u201cIn reality, authenticity involves self-awareness of your values, inner feelings, and personality, while also considering the expectations of the context,\u201d she said.\nIt\u2019s why it\u2019s perfectly normal (or perhaps wise, even) to have various versions of yourself, De Stobbeleir concludes: \u201cAuthenticity isn\u2019t about rigidly sticking to \u201cwho you are\u201d; rather it\u2019s about genuine self-expression within the context that you find yourself in.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s the you at work, there is the spouse, the parent, friend\u2026and it\u2019s normal that these different yous may not always be consistent.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

The deployments led to record revenues ($3.014 billion) and gross profit ($740 million) for the unit.\nThe growth of the Energy business displayed strong operating leverage as well, with gross margins expanding to 24.6% in Q2 compared to 18.4% a year ago. Meanwhile, Tesla\u2019s automotive gross margin slipped in Q2 to 18.5% from 19.2% a year ago.\nIn fact, the energy business\u2019s gross profit of $740 million made up 16.3% of Tesla\u2019s total gross profit, nearly triple the 6.1% it registered a year ago.\nTesla Energy is now making up more and more of the company's overall profit. Analysts and investors are taking notice and comparing it to another fast-growing unit that operates within a tech behemoth: Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\u201cYeah, I would [compare it to AWS],\u201d said Nancy Tengler, Laffer Tengler Investments CEO and chief investment officer, in an interview with Yahoo Finance, adding that the success of Tesla Energy and a tour of Tesla\u2019s Lathrop facility drove the firm to add to its Tesla holdings.\n\u201cThe growth [of Tesla Energy] has been impressive, the profitability \u2014 they are the lost cost producer in that segment, so we expect to see the growth really drive earnings in [the] next few years,\u201d she said. Laffer Tengler funds hold approximately 11,270 shares of Tesla.\nEarlier this month, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas dubbed Tesla\u2019s Q2 energy deployment storage figure a \u201cshow stealer,\u201d noting the 9.4 GWh deployed was double the firm\u2019s forecast.\nFollowing Q2 results, Cantor Fitzgerald also upped its price target for Tesla to $245, citing the energy storage business.\n\u201cWe are increasing our FY24 [Tesla] revenue estimate to $101.2B (from prior $100.6B), driven by an increase in our energy storage and deployment estimate. We now model 29GWh for FY24 (vs. prior 16.3GWh), which we now expect will translate into energy storage and deployment revenue of ~$9.6B (vs. prior ~$6.6B),\u201d Cantor said in a note.\nStifel reiterated its $265 price target and Buy rating following results, noting, among other factors, that Tesla Energy revenue and margins \u201ceasily beat expectations\u201d and growth appears \u201cstrong.\u201d\nAnalysts at Baird also noted that \u201cstrength\u201d in the Energy business and increasing regulatory credits that Tesla enjoys from EV sales will help offset headwinds from short-term weakness in auto margins. Baird has an Outperform rating and $265 price target.\nNot all analysts believe Tesla Energy will be a savior for a Tesla currently mired in slipping overall gross margins. UBS analysts believe Tesla\u2019s energy business success is already priced into the stock, noting the stock at current levels is mostly a bet on autonomy.\nJefferies noted the \u201cgrowing importance\u201d of Tesla Energy to gross profits, but analysts believe it isn\u2019t enough of a factor to upgrade \u201ccurrent consensus,\u201d which for Jefferies results in a $165 price target and Hold rating.\nNevertheless, Tesla Energy is a growing part of the Tesla web of ventures \u2014 from automotive, to charging, to AI, to services. And it might just be the most valuable in just a few years' time, if it can keep up its profitable growth, just like Amazon\u2019s AWS, which saw its revenue jump 17% year over year in the most recent quarter.\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering the auto industry.

        "Author": "  Laila Kearney ",
        "Text": "By Laila Kearney\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Talen Energy has asked U.S. regulators to reject a challenge to its recent Amazon data center deal, which is being opposed by a group of electric utilities that say the agreement could raise power bills for the public, according to a filing on Friday.\nTalen said the challenge, brought by utilities including American Electric Power and Exelon, was inaccurate and that its interconnection agreement for the Amazon data center site would not cause spiking power costs for utility customers or grid reliability problems.\n\"It is an unlawful attempt to hijack this limited interconnection service agreement amendment proceeding that they have no stake in and turn it into an ad hoc national referendum on the future of data center load,\" Talen said in its filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).\nTechnology companies are in a race to access massive amounts of electricity supplies to power and cool the data centers, or giant computer warehouses, needed to roll out technologies like generative AI. Nuclear energy, which is virtually carbon free and provides around-the-clock power, has become a top pick for the data center industry.\nFERC's decision could set a precedent for deals like the one with Talen, where data centers are located on the site of the power plants that feed them, allowing the centers to power up quickly without toiling in interconnection queues that can take years to clear.\nTalen announced in March it had entered into an agreement to sell electricity and a data center campus located at its Pennsylvania nuclear power plant to Amazon Web Services. The deal would provide Amazon's computer warehouses with an electric capacity of up to 960 megawatts, or enough to power about a million homes.\nA handful of electric utilities, including American Electric Power and Exelon, last month asked FERC to hold a hearing to more deeply scrutinize Talen's interconnection agreement with Amazon or deny it outright. The group said the interconnection agreement for the data center could result in a $140 million per year cost shift to everyday ratepayers.\nTalen says if FERC allows the hearing, or rejects its plan, it would have a chilling effect on data center expansion and deter new power plants from getting built in a time of U.S. electricity demand growth not seen in decades.\nAEP and Exelon say if the deal is allowed, as is, it could saddle everyday ratepayers with the costs of power infrastructure that does not benefit them, or suddenly sap the grid of large loads of power when the plants that act as a direct energy source to the data centers have unexpected interruptions.\nIt was unclear when FERC might issue a decision on the case.\n(Reporting by Laila Kearney; Editing by Josie Kao and Chris Reese)\n"

        "Text": "Amazon's AI-powered shopping assistant, named \"Rufus,\" is now live for all U.S. customers in the Amazon mobile app, the retailer announced on Friday. The assistant, which lives on the bottom right of the app's main navigation bar, is designed to offer customers help with finding products, performing product comparisons and getting recommendations on what to buy.\nRufus was initially available in beta only to select customers in the U.S. within the Amazon mobile app ahead of Friday's launch. Now, Amazon says all shoppers in the U.S. can try it after testing the chatbot across \"tens of millions of questions.\"\nFirst announced in February, the AI chatbot has been trained on Amazon's product catalog, customer reviews, community Q&As and other public information found around the web \u2014 though Amazon isn't disclosing specifically which websites' data was used to help its assistant make better recommendations, or whether that included other retail websites.\nRufus itself is powered by an internal large language model (LLM) specialized for shopping, allowing customers to ask questions about products, including things like factors to consider when buying, how items are different from other products, or how well the product holds up, as described by customer reviews and other expert analysis pulled from around the web.\nFor example, customers could ask things like \u201cWhat to consider when buying headphones?\u201d \u201cWhat to consider when detailing my car at home?\u201d \u201cWhat are clean beauty products?\u201d \u201cWhat do I need for cold weather golf?\u201d and more. Plus, customers can chat with Rufus, by telling the AI something they want to do, like: \u201cI want to start an indoor garden.\u201d The chatbot will then provide suggestions on what to buy to accomplish that task.\nDuring tests, Amazon found that customers asked the AI questions and were also clicking on the related questions that appear in the chat window to help guide customer queries. For instance, customers might ask Rufus, \"What's the material of the backpack?,\" and then tap on another question, \"What do customers say?\" to learn more.\nBecause Rufus understands more than just products, when a customer asked about a pool umbrella for Florida, Rufus shared facts about Florida's weather, humidity and more, Amazon says.\nIn addition to product comparisons, Rufus was also helpful in keeping customers up to date with things like fashion trends or the latest tech, as customers could ask what the latest model of a product was, or what sort of styles were popular.\nRufus also served beta customers as an assistant to help them find their past orders or learn more about when current orders are arriving.\nTo access Rufus, U.S. customers will need to be on the latest version of the Amazon Shopping app. The assistant will be available in the bottom navigation bar, designated by an icon with chat bubbles with a sparkle.\nIn tests, TechCrunch found that Rufus served as a decent shopping companion, and largely steered clear of problematic answers to questions outside of shopping. However, it didn't always get its facts right, and its limitations to only Amazon's catalog \u2014 vast as it is \u2014 could compromise the quality of its recommendations, at times.\nAmazon says it will continue to improve Rufus over time.\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2024/03/05/amazons-new-rufus-chatbot-isnt-bad-but-it-isnt-great-eitherThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/amazon-ai-chatbot-rufus-is-now-live-for-all-u-s-customers/\n"

Adobe Analytics said that American shoppers spent about $14.2 billion at online retailers over Tuesday and Wednesday combined.\nA record number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to the event, Amazon said. Adobe had earlier this week predicted $14 billion in total online retail spending, up more than 10% from last year's event.\nThis year's event was later in the month than last year's, which may have boosted sales of back-to-school products like backpacks, school supplies, and youth apparel, according to Adobe. Larger purchases like electronics and furniture were also more popular this year, Adobe said.\nSales were split evenly across the two days, Adobe said. Several Amazon retail competitors, including Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), and Macy's (M) ran their own sales events in the days around Prime Day.\nAmazon's shares were recently down more than 2% amid a broader pullback from the big tech stocks that have driven markets this year.\nRead the original article on Investopedia.\n"

        "Text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Amazon\u2019s popular Prime Day sales event has been \u201ca major cause of injuries\u201d for warehouse workers who pick and pack customer orders at the e-commerce giant's facilities across the United States, according to a report released Tuesday by Sen. Bernie Sanders.\nThe report, which draws information from a year-long Senate committee investigation into Amazon's safety practices and relied on internal company data from 2019 and 2020, said peak shopping times \u2013 including the holiday shopping period \u2013 resulted in the \u201chighest weekly injury rates\u201d for warehouse workers.\nThe preliminary report from Sanders' office was also based on interviews with more than 100 current and former Amazon employees. This year's two-day Prime Day event started Tuesday.\nIn a statement, Sanders said the \u201cincredibly dangerous working conditions at Amazon\u201d highlighted in the report are a \"perfect example of the type of corporate greed that the American people are sick and tired of.\"\n\u201cDespite making $36 billion in profits last year and providing its CEO with over $275 million in compensation over the past three years, Amazon continues to treat its workers as disposable and with complete contempt for their safety and well-being,\" said the Vermont independent, who has been critical of Amazon and supports worker efforts to unionize at the company. \u201cThat is unacceptable, and that has got to change.\u201d\nLabor unions and safety experts have long criticized Amazon, alleging the company\u2019s focus on speed and fast deliveries puts workers in danger. In recent years, some states have passed laws aimed at Amazon to curb the use of warehouse productivity quotas, though the company claims it doesn't employ them.\nAccording to the Senate report, 45 out of 100 warehouse at Amazon received injuries during the 2019 Prime Day event. The number included minor injuries the company was not required to disclose to the federal government, such as bruises and superficial cuts, but also serious ones such as concussions that should have been reported, it said.\nAmazon disputed the finding.\n\u201cThe claims that we systemically underreport injuries, and that our actual injury rates are higher than publicly reported, are false,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe\u2019re required to report every injury that needs more than basic first aid, and that\u2019s what we do.\u201d\nWhile Amazon \u201cmight make an occasional clerical error,\u201d a six-month federal investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found \u201cno intentional, willful, or systemic errors\u201d in the company\u2019s reporting, Nantel said.\nThe report also alleged that Amazon had a practice of failing to refer workers for outside medical care because doing so could affect whether an injury should be considered \u201crecordable\u201d and referred to OSHA. Even when injuries were serious and might have required extra medical attention, workers often received first aid before being sent back to work instead of to a doctor, it said.\nAmazon has acknowledged in the past that its warehouse injury rates had been higher compared to its peers. Federal safety investigators levied fines against the company in recent years following inspections at some of its warehouses. Some of the inspections arose from referrals made to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, which is also investigating worker safety at the company through its civil division.\nLast month, California fined Amazon a total of $5.9 million, accusing the company of violating the state\u2019s Warehouse Quota Law at two facilities.\nA spokesperson for Sanders' office said the committee relied on 2019 and 2020 workplace injury rate data because that\u2019s what Amazon provided for the inquiry.\nHowever, Amazon spokesperson Nantel said that the Senate review ignored the progress the company has made since 2019 in reducing its rate of recordable incidents \u2013 those which require more care than basic first aid \u2013 by 28%. The company also has improved the rate of significant injuries that require an employee to miss at least a day of work by 75%, she said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve cooperated throughout this investigation, including providing thousands of pages of information and documents,\u201d Nantel said. \u201cBut unfortunately, this report (which was not shared with us before publishing) ignores our progress and paints a one-sided, false narrative using only a fraction of the information we\u2019ve provided. It draws sweeping and inaccurate conclusions based on unverified anecdotes, and it misrepresents documents that are several years old and contained factual errors and faulty analysis.\u201d\nThe report also says Amazon failed to adequately staff its warehouses during peak shopping times, which the company disputed. Amazon said in March that it allocated over $750 million to safety efforts for this year.\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation.\u00a0Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer in a program last week tried to make sense of the decline in tech stocks, saying companies with the \u201cbest fundamentals\u201d got \u201chammered once again.\u201d\n\u201cI did not expect that to happen.\u201d\nCramer said that sometimes it\u2019s difficult to own the \u201cwinners.\u201d The CNBC host said it\u2019s important to understand the bear cases around stocks otherwise you will never know what \u201cyou are up against.\u201d\nJim Cramer tried to find out whether the latest decline in top tech stocks was just a \u201cperiodic selloff\u201d that presented an \u201copportunity.\u201d\n\u201cWhen we get this kind of rotation, you never know whether these stocks are selling off because there\u2019s something wrong or because they are up huge.\u201d\nJim Cramer pointed to a caveat when it comes to holding winning stocks. When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.\nThe CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has \u201cchanged.\u201d\n\u201cFrom what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.\u201d\nIn this program, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies\u2019 fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\nJim Cramer said in a latest program that people are selling Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) because it sells 40 times its earnings, which is \u201cunusually high, even for Amazon.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a huge beneficiary from lower interest rates so people are fleeing from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and buying cyclical plays.\u201d\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to gain on the back of its AWS business which is set to benefit from the rise in AI spending. Mizuho recently cited a survey conducted by one of its partners which shows that AWS sales cycle is seeing acceleration. Mizuho analyst James Lee reiterated his Outperform rating on the stock and gave a $240 price target. \u00a0The survey shows that spending on AWS is expected to rise about 22% year over year in 2024, up from the previous estimate of 20%, as generative AI projects are seen at an \u201cinflection point\u201d with external models about six months away from commercial deployment.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0doesn\u2019t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled \u201cchatbot recommendations\u201d as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0strength in the application layer of AI.\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) operates the world\u2019s leading e-commerce marketplace and the largest public cloud platform and has a burgeoning advertising business. We expect to see sustained margin improvement as Amazon\u2019s retail regionalization efforts are bearing fruit and as its advertising business continues to scale ahead of peers. We believe the profitability ramp is still in the early innings as the company turns its attention to improving costs. One area will be inbound shipping, where faster delivery times through reduced freight, miles and packaging can reduce waste. We also see generative AI tailwinds and infrastructure modernization driving re-acceleration in growth at AWS, further enhancing Amazon\u2019s free cash flow compounding potential. In addition, following our early 2024 ESG engagements with Amazon (after multiyear engagements) we were positively inclined to see continued improvements in labor relations (health and safety metrics, benefits and wages), as well as in environmental stewardship (climate targets, reducing packaging materials, electric delivery trucks) and innovation (commitments to responsible AI and data privacy). One of the newly announced initiatives on the retail side is consolidating deliveries into fewer boxes, which reduces packaging.\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer is Talking About 10 Falling Stocks Amid Latest Market Rotation.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

And even if it does offer the lowest advertised prices for some items, many stores will price match Amazon.\nHere\u2019s a look at the nine stores that will price match Amazon.\nIf you\u2019re shopping at Target, consider checking the price on Amazon first, as Target does price match Amazon according to their price match guarantee policy. The complete list of online competitors it will price match is available as a PDF on its website or at Guest Services. Note that you must find an identical item through Amazon to get a price match.\nYou have 14 days to make the request at a physical store location or over the phone for Target.com purchases, and you need proof to request the adjustment. Target also doesn\u2019t match prices for customers residing in Hawaii and Alaska.\nBest Buy, well-known for its price match guarantee, will match Amazon items if they are the same brand, model and color. You can price match at the time of purchase or doing the return/exchange period for that item.\nPrice matches for BestBuy.com purchases are handled online or over the phone, while in-store purchases can be price matched in stores.\nDoes Lowe\u2019s price match Amazon\u2019s prices? Yes, Lowe\u2019s has a price match promise that offers customers a price match if they find an item that costs less at competitors, including Amazon.\nIf you find a lower price for an identical item from a qualifying retailer while shopping online, you can validate it by calling 1-877-465-6937 or by chatting with an online rep. In-store price matches can be handled by a store associate.\nAs an added perk, Lowe\u2019s also includes the cost of the item, including shipping or delivery fees. Additionally, Lowe\u2019s can only validate the price match if the original purchaser makes the request.\nTrending Now: 10 Top Items To Buy at Aldi with a $50 Grocery Budget\nMany may not know, but Ashley Furniture will price match Amazon. To qualify for a reimbursement, the product must be the same in model, SKU, brand, name and color as the item you purchased.\nAdditionally, the item must be in stock and available on both websites. Ashley\u2019s in-store price guarantee says it will beat competitors by $1, though its website does not specify if Amazon is one of those online competitors, so you may want to check with your local store.\nStaples has a 100% price match guarantee for items you find in-store that are also on Amazon at a lower price. The process is simple \u2014 once you find a lower price, you can bring the proof to a Staples associate and receive a price match, but you can\u2019t do so online or after the fact.\nWhile Bed Bath & Beyond stores are closed, you can still shop its website and get price matches, including for some items sold at Amazon, if you join the Welcome Rewards program for $19.95 per year.\nBe sure to check the price match policy at the time of your purchase, as Bed Bath & Beyond\u2019s terms are stricter than some other sites, such as being limited to three items per month and excluding appliances and electronics.\nYou can request a price match after completing an order by going into your account online, clicking on My Orders, and then if an item is eligible, it will have a clickable \u201cEligible for Price Match\u201d tag, where you can then submit a request form. You need to do so within seven days of the purchase.\nJC Penny does price match Amazon for online and in-store purchases in the continental US. You have up to 14 days from making your purchase to receive a price match. The price match guarantee does not include shipping charges.\nUnless you call their customer service number, you must bring proof of the lower price on Amazon. If you are calling, the representative must verify that the price is lower on Amazon before they can complete the price match.\nDoes Home Depot price match Amazon? Yes, Home Depot\u2019s \u201cGuaranteed Low Price\u201d policy includes matching online competitor prices, including shipping costs, for HomeDepot.com purchases. In-store purchases can also be matched at the register against Amazon prices.\nDick\u2019s Sporting Goods has a price match policy for customers who find an identical product match at a lower price, including from Amazon. To qualify, ensure the item is the same brand, model number, color and it is not from a third-party reseller or marketplace.\nYou can receive your price match in-store by bringing proof of the cheaper item, or if shopping online, you can call 1-877-846-9997.\nWith all retailers on this list guaranteeing a price match, you can save hundreds of dollars annually on needed items.\nBefore you request a match, always make sure that you read each retailer\u2019s policy and what it excludes. The stores that will price match Amazon aim to satisfy their customers, but remember that some conditions apply, such as for some sale items and those sold by third-party sellers.\nJake Safane contributed to the reporting for this article.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n9 Cars To Stay Away From In Retirement\n7 Worst States To Buy Property in the Next 5 Years, According to Real Estate Agents\n5 Genius Things People With Healthy Savings Do\n5 Myths About Debt That Nobody Should Believe in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 9 Stores That Will Price Match Amazon: What You Need To Know To Get the Best Deals\n"

        "Text": "While online shopping is convenient, it unfortunately also comes with risks. One such risk is becoming the victim of a \u201ctriangle scam,\u201d also know as triangulation fraud.\nBeware: 5 Oil Change Scams That Will Cost You Money \u2014 or Even Your Car\nLearn More: Cash App Scams 2024: Common Ones To Know and Keep Your Money Safe\nNever heard of it? Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll break down what it is, how to spot one, and how you can avoid becoming a victim of a triangle scheme.\nA triangle scam is a type of fraud that involves three parties: the scammer, the unsuspecting buyer, and an innocent third-party seller. The scam typically unfolds as follows:\nThe Scammer: The fraudster steals or acquires someone\u2019s credit card information.\nThe Buyer: The scammer lists popular items at suspiciously attractive prices on a platform like Amazon to lure in potential buyers.\nThe Seller: Once a buyer makes a purchase, the scammer uses the stolen credit card information to buy the item from a legitimate seller and has it shipped directly to the buyer.\nThe unsuspecting buyer receives the product and believes everything is legitimate. Meanwhile, the seller ships the item, thinking they have made a legitimate sale.\nThe scam is often only uncovered when the credit card owner notices unauthorized charges and disputes them, leading to chargebacks. The legitimate seller is left without payment, and the buyer may be implicated in a fraudulent transaction.\nRecognizing the signs of a triangle scam can help you avoid falling prey to one. Here are some red flags to watch out for:\nToo-Good-To-Be-True Prices: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Scammers often lure buyers with prices significantly lower than market value.\nNew or Unverified Sellers: Be cautious when buying from new or unverified sellers with no feedback or reviews. Scammers often create new accounts to conduct their scams.\nUnusual Payment Requests: Be wary of sellers who request payment through unconventional methods outside of Amazon, such as wire transfers or gift cards.\nNon-Standard Shipping Practices: If the seller insists on shipping methods that are unusual or refuses to provide tracking information, it could be a red flag. Legitimate sellers typically offer reliable shipping options and provide tracking details.\nAwareness is the first step in protecting yourself from triangle scams. Here are some practical steps to avoid becoming a victim:\nResearch the Seller: Before making a purchase, take the time to research the seller. Check their ratings, read reviews, and look for any history of complaints. Established sellers with positive feedback are less likely to be involved in scams.\nUse Secure Payment Methods: Always use secure payment methods provided by the platform, such as Amazon. Avoid making payments outside of the platform, as this can make it difficult to recover your money if something goes wrong.\nBe Skeptical of Unrealistic Deals: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Compare prices with other sellers and be cautious of items listed at prices significantly lower than the average market rate.\nBy understanding what a triangle scam is, recognizing the warning signs, and taking proactive steps to protect yourself, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to such schemes.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nDollar Tree: 10 Best New Arrivals for Your Money in July\nIn Less Than a Year, You Might Not Be Able To Afford To Live in These 6 US Housing Markets\n5 Moves Every Woman Should Consider Before Retirement\nThis is The Single Most Overlooked Tool for Becoming Debt-Free\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Triangle Scams on Amazon: How To Spot and Avoid These Schemes\u00a0\n"

        "Title": "On Prime Day, Amazon workers like me pay a high price",
        "Author": "  Wendy Taylor ",
        "Text": "Since 2020, I have worked at an [hotlink ignore=true]Amazon Warehouse outside St. Louis. This week is my fourth Prime Day. I\u2019m not sure my body can take it. I started at Amazon with a sense of optimism. I was working for a company known around the world for delivering anything, anytime, anywhere. I was proud to be helping folks trapped at home during the pandemic get what they needed for their families. But that feeling quickly vanished. Just a few months in, I could already feel the toll the job was taking on my muscles and mental state. My legs grew numb, and I was constantly fatigued.  On average, I\u2019m expected to pack around 600 items every hour during my shift, scanning each and making sure it\u2019s moving properly down the belt. Taking a break is nearly impossible. At most, Amazon plays a 10-second safety video a few times a day telling us to stretch. Otherwise, I move as quickly as possible because if I don\u2019t make my rate, I could be written up and fired. And even if I do hit that goal, managers tell me to speed up.  Amazon\u2019s relentless push for speed is mentally draining and physically dangerous. It leads to injuries as we break our bodies down to meet our quotas. Last year, I was rushing to my workstation, tripped over a misplaced pallet, fell on my face, busted my nose and lips and suffered a torn meniscus. I was out of work for almost two months.  Working in an Amazon warehouse is very dangerous every day of the year, but during peak times like Prime Day, which takes place this year on July 16 and 17, our jobs are even more perilous. New data from Amazon shows just how dangerous Prime is for workers like me. The Strategic Organizing Center, a coalition of labor unions, analyzed the timing of injuries for 2023 and found injury levels at Amazon warehouses spiked during the company\u2019s peak operational periods, including Prime Days and Cyber Monday.  The SOC found that in 2023 Amazon reported its single highest weekly serious injury total, 1,066 cases, during the week of Prime Day in July, representing a 48 percent increase from the previous week. Working during prime days is grueling. Our quotas go up even higher than usual. We are told to stay hydrated, yet we barely have time to use the bathroom, and Amazon\u2019s 8- to 10-second stretch breaks typically disappear. I have to work extra hours and extra shifts\u2014resulting in 11.5-hour shifts for five days a week. During Prime, Amazon freezes vacation\u2014making it difficult to see family\u2014and, aside from weekends, all I have time to do outside of work is eat and sleep. Each year, it seems to get worse, with fewer breaks and more workers suffering injuries. One coworker was moved to a new area that was understaffed during Prime, wasn\u2019t trained and broke her ankle. Working during Prime makes you feel like you walked 50 miles in one day. You go home, get a few hours of sleep and do another 50 miles the next day. You lose feeling in your feet.  In 2021, Amazon committed to cutting its injury rate in half and becoming \u201cEarth\u2019s Safest Place to Work,\u201d but in the three years since that promise, the company\u2019s total injury rate has gone down less than two percent. Amazon leadership barely talks about safety anymore. Instead, they brag about delivering \u201cat the fastest speeds ever\u201d and talk about their plans to cut costs and \u201cinvest in speed.\u201d I want people to know there\u2019s a human cost to all of those Prime Day deals, delivered at the click of a mouse. I\u2019m 58 and would like to stay at Amazon, as long as my body holds up, but something has to change. That\u2019s why I\u2019m organizing for a union alongside Amazon workers nationwide to create a better, fairer place to work, where workers get living wages and a say on the job. A union is the best way for us to make Amazon safe for all warehouse workers, and we will keep building our strength in numbers and speaking out until we win.  This Prime Day will push my body to the limit, but I believe it will also push more workers to join us in our fight to make Amazon a place where we can be proud to work.  +++ Editor's note: The following is a condensed and edited response from Amazon The information we\u2019d need to verify these claims wasn\u2019t provided to us and it\u2019s unreasonable to take a single anecdote to make conclusions about safety at a company with more than a million workers. Employee safety is our top priority. We\u2019ve made measurable progress on safety including improving our recordable incident rate by 28% since 2019, and our rate of injuries that result in lost time by 75%. We've consistently used 2019 as our benchmark to gauge progress, and that\u2019s clear in all of our annual safety updates. Like any business, we have performance expectations for all of our teams, but they aren\u2019t static and they\u2019re based on multiple factors, including the overall performance of the entire team across an individual site. Employees are free to take breaks whenever they need them to use the restroom, grab water, or speak to a manager or HR. This is in addition to the two breaks they receive each shift, and their lunch break. There\u2019s no truth to the claim that \u201cworking in an Amazon warehouse is very dangerous every day of the year.\u201d During times of high demand, employees are sometimes asked to work overtime, but they\u2019re never asked to work more than 12 hours per day and no more than 60 hours in a week. There are far more people working in the buildings during peak times and more total hours worked by those employees\u2014facts that the SOC report fails to acknowledge or account for.\nMore commentary published by Fortune: \n3 in 4 Gen Zers are interested in vocational training as uncertainty and AI shape the minds of the next \u2018toolbelt generation\u2019\nI connect U.S. manufacturers with their workforce.

        "Author": "  JOE REEDY ",
        "Text": "Turner Sports intends to continue its longtime relationship with the NBA.\nWarner Bros. Discovery informed the league Monday that it will match the $1.8 billion per year offer by Amazon Prime Video. Turner has had an NBA package since 1984 and games have been on TNT since the network launched in 1988.\n\u201cWe have reviewed the offers and matched one of them. This will allow fans to keep enjoying our unparalleled coverage, including the best live game productions in the industry and our iconic studio shows and talent, while building on our proven 40-year commitment for many more years,\u201d Warner Bros. Discovery said in a statement. \"Our matching paperwork was submitted to the league today. We look forward to the NBA executing our new contract.\u201d\nThe NBA\u2019s Board of Governors approved the league\u2019s 11-year media rights deals with Disney, NBC and Amazon Prime Video at its meeting in Las Vegas last Tuesday. WBD received all three contracts Wednesday, which started the five-day clock for whether it wanted to match.\nThe new deals \u2014 collectively worth $76 billion \u2014 will begin with the 2025-26 season, and include a game being aired or streamed nationally every night during the second half of the season.\nThe Prime Video offer has games on Thursday night after it is done carrying NFL games. Its other nights are Friday and Saturday.\nAmazon Prime Video did not comment on WBD's intention to match.\nAn NBA spokesperson said the league is reviewing the matching offer.\nIf the NBA accepts the matching offer, TNT would likely carry games on Thursday with the other nights being streamed on Max.\nWarner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav sounded an ominous note when he said during an RBC Investor Conference in November 2022 that Turner and WBD \u201cdon\u2019t have to have the NBA.\u201d\nWarner Bros. Discovery and the league were unable to reach a deal during the exclusive negotiating period, which expired in April. Zaslav and TNT Sports Chairman/CEO Luis Silberwasser have said during the past couple months, though, that it intended to match one of the deals.\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of how we have delivered for basketball fans by providing best-in-class coverage throughout our four-decade partnership with the NBA. In an effort to continue our long-standing partnership, during both exclusive and non-exclusive negotiation periods, we acted in good faith to present strong bids that were fair to both parties,\u201d WBD said in a statement. \u201cRegrettably, the league notified us of its intention to accept other offers for the games in our current rights package, leaving us to proceed under the matching rights provision, which is an integral part of our current agreement and the rights we have paid for under it.\"\nPeople familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press that Amazon\u2019s offer included a provision to pay multiple years up front into an escrow account, which many thought would make it hard to match. However, WBD has told the league it has the financial resources to be able to do that.\nThe Amazon provision was first mentioned by \u201cThe Ringer\u2019s\u201d Bill Simmons on \u201cThe Town\u201d podcast.\nThe people spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t at liberty to discuss such impending matters.\nWBD is paying $1.4 billion per season under the current nine-year deal, which expires after next season.\nEven though WBD would be making a huge financial commitment, it is a necessary one. Without the NBA, it would have had a hard time charging its current subscriber fees to cable and satellite companies.\nRetaining the NBA would also mean that the popular \u201cInside the NBA\u201d show would continue. Charles Barkley had been critical of WBD\u2019s negotiating posture and was not optimistic about it matching. Barkley announced at the end of this season that he intended to retire after next season.\nIt is expected that the NBA would announce the finality of the media deals sometime this week.\nESPN and ABC, which will keep the league\u2019s top package, will have a conference finals every year as well as the NBA Finals. NBC and WBD would alternate which one carries one of the conference finals series.\nThe return of NBC, which carried NBA games from 1990 through 2002, would give the league two broadcast network partners for the first time.\n___\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\n"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL, Walmart Inc. WMT and Chevron Corp. CVX.\nU.S. stock markets have been on an impressive bull run over the past 18 months. However, the Dow, despite participating in the rally, lagged its peers, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. Wall Street\u2019s blue-chip index is up 5.4% year to date. On the other hand, the broad-market S&P 500 Index and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite have climbed 17.8% and 23.8%, respectively.\nMeanwhile, the Dow recorded its all-time high of 40,077.40 on an intraday basis on Mar 20 and 40,003.59 on a closing basis on May 17. Technically, at its current level of 39,753.75, the Dow is well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of 39,035.26 and 37,365.23, respectively.\nThe 50-day moving average line is generally recognized as a short-term trendsetter in financial literature, while the 200-day moving average is considered a long-term trendsetter. Historically it has been noticed in the technical analysis space that whenever the 50-day moving average line surges ahead of the 200-day moving average line, a long-term uptrend for the asset (in this case the Dow Index) becomes a strong possibility.\nWe have narrowed our search to four Dow stocks that have strong earnings growth potential for the rest of 2024. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Finally, each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nAmazon.com Inc. is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. A deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive for AMZN.\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN\u2019s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home offerings are tailwinds. The advertising business is also pretty robust. AMZN enjoys a strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are its other positives.\nZacks Rank #2 Amazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 57.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last 60 days.\nApple Inc. has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, AAPL\u2019s competitive position is expected to improve. Moreover, AAPL is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment.\nThe expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped drive subscriber growth. AAPL\u2019s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\nZacks Rank #2 Apple has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.8% and 7.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending September 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days.\nWalmart Inc. has been gaining from its highly diversified business with contributions from various segments, channels and formats. WMT has been benefiting from an increase in in-store and digital channel traffic due to its robust omnichannel initiatives. Store-fulfilled delivery sales jumped 50% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nWalmart\u2019s strategic focus on enhancing delivery services has also been rewarding, as evidenced by the constant increase in the market share for groceries. Upsides like these, along with growth in the advertising business, fueled WMT\u2019s first-quarter results and led to an encouraging fiscal 2025 view.\nZacks Rank #1 Walmart has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.3% and 9.5%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3% over the last 60 days.\nChevron Corp. is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Further, the recent acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen CVX\u2019s presence in oil-rich Guyana.\nCVX seems one of the best-placed global integrated oil companies to achieve sustainable production ramp-up. We expect the company's average output during 2024 to rise 4-7% year over year, due to the PDC Energy acquisition and robust output in the showpiece Permian Basin region.\nZacks Rank #2 Chevron has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 2.3% and 0.4%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Use your membership for enhanced discounts and deals, whether shopping for high-ticket items or stocking up on essentials at reduced prices.\n\u201cMany Prime Day sale items are overstock inventory that merchants are clearing out while they have a massive audience,\u201d said Vipin Porwal, founder and consumer expert at Smarty.\nPay attention to the featured sales. Those sellers pay a premium to Amazon to feature their best products, often at their lowest prices. However, Porwal said these deals also have a time limit.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s an item from an unverified seller or a brand you\u2019re not familiar with and it\u2019s not something you really need, sometimes the savings aren\u2019t worth the risk,\u201d he said.\nMichael Robert, a cybersecurity specialist and tech expert, said he also uses Instagram and Alexa to help him score Amazon deals.\n\u201cLast Prime Day, an Instagram story helped me score a smart home device at a great price,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, Alexa shares early access or exclusives. It\u2019s like having your own insider on your team.\u201d\nMembers can also use their credit card rewards points to make purchases and maximize their savings, said Len Covello, Chief Technology Officer at Engage People, a loyalty network that enables program members to pay with points directly at checkout.\n\u201cBy leveraging the Pay with Points (PwP) option, consumers can reduce out-of-pocket expenses and save on items they want and need most on Prime Day,\u201d Covello said.\nAmazon-owned products like Echo, Ring, Kindle and GoodThreads are expected to offer shoppers great deals. However, Porwal said most major Amazon sellers will compete with reduced prices during the event.\n\u201cSome will reduce prices the whole event while others will have short promotional sales at historically low prices to move that inventory quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s important to act fast if you really like a deal.\u201d\nIn addition, Robert recommended setting alerts to capture Lightning Deals.\n\u201cI set deal alerts so that I\u2019m the first to know when something I want goes on sale,\u201d he said. \u201cIt pays to stay on top of new offers.\u201d\nMore From GOBankingRates\n9 Things You Must Buy at Big Lots While on a Retirement Budget\nI'm a Mechanic: These 4 Cars Have Engines That Could Die on You\n3 Things to Do This Week If You Have Debt\n3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 5 Ways To Save on Amazon Prime Day Without Unnecessary Spending\n"

        "Title": "Amazon finance chief blames weak sales forecast on shoppers distracted by Trump assassination attempt and Olympics",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "So much for retail therapy.\nAfter Amazon reported a weaker-than-expected sales outlook for the third quarter on Thursday, sending its shares down more than 7% in after-hours trading, a top company executive posited a unique cause on a call with reporters.\nAmazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said that Amazon web traffic patterns indicate that shoppers are distracted by rare, major news events\u2014such as the Olympics and the historically turbulent US presidential race, which has already included both an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden dropping from the race\u2014and are potentially deferring purchases as a result, or just skipping them altogether.\nSuch monumental news events in the past have made it \"harder to forecast,\" Olsavsky said, and company leaders are once again battling with that reality. Amazon said it was forecasting between $154 billion and $158.5 billion in revenue for the current third quarter, a range that suggests sales will likely come in below the average analyst estimate of $158.24 billion.\nRather than seeking comfort in the \"buy now\" button, it seems that shoppers are reacting to the roller-coaster news cycle by spending less.\nAmazon's revenue in the three months ended June 30 also came in slightly below expectations at $148 billion, though earnings were stronger than expected with net profit of $13.5 billion. While the number of goods \u2014 or units \u2014 sold by Amazon in the quarter was strong, customers favored items at lower price points, according to Olsavsky and CEO Andy Jassy, who made an appearance on a conference call with analysts.\nPart of that trend is due to economic worries, the executives said they believe, but there is also another factor at play. Amazon has been investing heavily in speeding up delivery times so that customers rely on the retailer more for last-minute needs like non-perishable foods and household and beauty items that typically are inexpensive compared to other categories of products like electronics or apparel. The company is winning share in consumables, but the low average cost per transaction is weighing on revenue.\nOn the bright side for the company, revenue growth inside the Amazon Web Services cloud computing business continues to reaccelerate. Sales growth in the unit accelerated to 18.8%, up from 17.1% in the first three months in the year, driven by customer spending both on Gen AI products and services as well as more traditional cloud infrastructure projects after a period of more cost-focused spending by AWS clients.\nJassy reiterated his revelation from last quarter that Gen AI is on pace to drive multiple billions of revenue for AWS this year. To get ahead of that, and other renewed cloud demand, Amazon is on pace to spend more on capital investments in the second half of the year than the $30.5 billion it doled out in the first six months of 2024. The massive cap ex spending is in line with rivals such Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta, which have all reported big increases on infrastructure investments in recent quarters.\nAmazon's investments, Olsavsky said, are being made to \"drive revenue and free cash flow for the next decade and beyond.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

You can ask for lists of recommended products and ask what specific products do and stuff like that.\nI\u2019ve tooled around with it a bit this morning and it seems fine, though a bit boring. I will say that I cross-referenced some of the recommended products with the web version and Rufus does not automatically list promoted items, at least for now.\nIt spit out a seemingly random list of well-reviewed products on several occasions. That\u2019s fine by me, though I\u2019m not about to buy something based on the word of a one-day old chatbot. You can also ask specific questions about products, but the answers seem to be pulled directly from the descriptions. As any regular Amazon customer knows, some of these descriptions are accurate and others aren\u2019t. The chatbot is tied to your personal account, so it can answer questions about upcoming deliveries and the like.\nAmazon says that the bot has been trained on its product catalog, along with customer reviews, community Q&As and public information found throughout the web. However, it hasn\u2019t disclosed what websites it pulled that public information from and to what end. It didn\u2019t even confirm that these were retail-adjacent websites.\nIf you want to try it out, update to the latest version of the app and look for the colorful icon on the bottom-right. Maybe, if we all work hard enough at asking ridiculous questions, we can break it just in time for Amazon Prime Day.\n"

        "Text": "Amazon (AMZN) closed at $182.55 in the latest trading session, marking a -0.32% move from the prior day. The stock fell short of the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 1.08% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.32%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 1.58%.\nShares of the online retailer have depreciated by 3.15% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Retail-Wholesale sector's loss of 0.31% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.43%.\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Amazon in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to be unveiled on August 1, 2024. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.02, up 61.9% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $148.54 billion, up 10.54% from the year-ago period.\nAMZN's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $4.58 per share and revenue of $638.24 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +57.93% and +11.04%, respectively.\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Amazon. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\nRanging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Amazon currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Amazon has a Forward P/E ratio of 39.97 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 21.16.\nWe can also see that AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 1.35. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The Internet - Commerce industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.04 as trading concluded yesterday.\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 60, positioning it in the top 24% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nTo follow AMZN in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "For all of Amazon\u2019s technological innovations, the tech giant has also excelled at exploiting loopholes during its history. In its early years, that meant taking advantage of tax laws that allowed online retailers to avoid collecting, and thus charging, sales tax, which created a pricing advantage over traditional retail shops.\nAs a publicly traded company, Amazon convinced investors from early on to let it play by a unique set of rules: Reward us for revenue growth now and we promise the profits will follow at some point in the future.\nBut a significant one related to product liability may have just evaporated.\nMuch of Amazon\u2019s retail success has been predicated on a structure where it acts as both a retailer that purchases and resells goods itself, as well as a marketplace that allows independent merchants to list items to be sold to Amazon customers. The marketplace model has been crucial to Amazon\u2019s success, creating massive selection and price competition that now accounts for some 60% of all goods sold through the shopping site. Amazon also generated $140 billion in revenue in the form of fees from its marketplace sellers in 2023 alone.\nThat massive selection, however, has historically come with downsides that may include not as much vetting of a product as a traditional retailer might do. Case in point: The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) found a few years back that more than 400,000 items sold through Amazon\u2019s third-party marketplace posed a significant product hazard, including faulty carbon monoxide detectors, hair dryers that lacked electrocution protection, and kids\u2019 pajamas that did not meet federal flammability standards.\nThese items were offered by merchants through an Amazon program known as Fulfillment by Amazon, or FBA, whereby Amazon handles the storage, packing, shipping, and customer service for an order.\nIn the wake of that finding, Amazon did credit customer accounts and inform them that a product they bought \u201cmay\u201d cause harm but, at the same time, the tech giant fought the commission\u2019s claim that it was legally responsible for the recall of the items as a \u201cdistributor\u201d of the goods. Instead, Amazon said it was acting solely as a logistics provider.\nToday, however, the CPSC announced a unanimous ruling dismissing that argument, making Amazon legally responsible for product safety recalls as a \u201cdistributor\u201d due to the holistic role it plays in the sale of goods through its FBA program.\nThe agency also ruled that Amazon downplayed the severity of the risks of these products in its communication to customers and should have to incentivize buyers to either return or dispose of the faulty products to avoid them being used.\nIn the short term, the ruling means that Amazon must now submit a proposal to the commission on how it will notify customers and the public about the product hazards, and to provide refunds or replacements for these products. The commission will then consider the plans and rule on them.\nIn the long term, however, such a ruling of Amazon as a \u201cdistributor\u201d through its marketplace business could have a profound impact on how the tech giant expands and monitors the business.\nJason Del Rey\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

        "Title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Amazon Stock?",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) hit a new all-time high last week, rising to $200 per share. The rally came as multiple tech companies similarly achieved new highs, including Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms.\nRecent dips in unemployment increase the likelihood of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. Lower interest rates will allow companies to borrow at a lower cost, a prospect that has made Wall Street bullish.\nHowever, a potential decrease in interest rates isn't the only reason to consider buying Amazon's stock. After more than a year of impressive gains in its e-commerce business, the company is on a promising growth trajectory. Meanwhile, Amazon's heavy investments in markets like cloud computing, AI, and digital advertising are beginning to pay off.\nOver the years, Amazon consistently and strategically reinvested in its business, diversifying revenue streams and becoming one of the biggest players in tech. As a result, its stock price has soared 105% over the last five years and is likely nowhere near hitting its ceiling.\nSo, here's why it's not too late to invest in Amazon's stock.\nMacroeconomic headwinds in 2022 brought the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 crashing 33% and 19%, respectively, throughout the challenging year. Many of the world's most valuable companies were affected, with Amazon's shares plunging 50%. Spikes in inflation caused consumers to pullback, leading to steep profit declines in the company's retail segments.\nAmazon responded to poor market conditions by introducing strict cost-cutting measures. Alongside market improvements, the retail giant's performance over the last year has illustrated its ability to successfully navigate dips in the market and come back strong once headwinds subside.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Amazon's revenue increased by 13% year over year. The company's e-commerce divisions posted significant gains, with sales in its North American and international segments up 12% and 10%, respectively.\nHowever, the most impressive growth came from rising profits, as the two retail segments hit nearly $6 billion in operating income. The figure outperforms last year's losses of $349 million, with the business staunchly returning to profitability. A solid turnaround in Amazon's e-commerce segments proves the reliability of its business, as it's clearly never down for long.\nRetail still accounts for more than 80% of the company's revenue despite expansions into other markets. Recent earnings show that the backbone of Amazon's business is thriving, expanding its cash reserves and increasing its spending power in other markets.\nAmazon is never still for long, a characteristic that has seen the company expand from an online book retailer in Seattle to a behemoth in e-commerce, cloud computing, video streaming, and dozens of other sectors.\nIn 2024 alone, Amazon has invested billions into developing Amazon Web Services' (AWS) cloud infrastructure in regions such as Taiwan, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and more. On home soil, the company is broadening its reach by building data centers in Indiana and Virginia, spending a combined $46 billion in the U.S. projects.\nMuch of Amazon's focus is on AWS because of its massive potential in AI and high-profit margins. Cloud computing has become a crucial growth area in AI as companies increasingly turn to such platforms to integrate the generative technology into their businesses. As the world's largest cloud service, AWS is working to maintain its lead as rivals Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud similarly expand.\nAdditionally, AWS has quickly become Amazon's most profitable business. In Q1 2024, AWS sales rose 17% year over year while operating income nearly doubled. Despite earning the lowest portion of revenue among Amazon's three primary segments, AWS was responsible for 62% of its operating income.\nIn addition to cloud computing, Q1 2024 highlighted the potential of Amazon's burgeoning digital-ad business. During the quarter, its advertising-services revenue rose 24% year over year after the introduction of ads on its Prime Video streaming service. Streaming advertising is a relatively new market, with companies like Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery only recently launching new ad-supported tiers to their platforms. However, Amazon's leading market share in streaming could give it an edge in the space, allowing it to attract advertisers more easily.\nAmazon's business is expanding quickly, and despite recently hitting a new high in its share price, the company likely has much more to offer investors over the long term. Meanwhile, its price-to-sales ratio of 3.5 suggests its stock is trading at a value, making it too good to pass up this July.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

The strong demand for its services in the cloud, the Internet of Things (IoT), cyber security and data and analytics is a key driver.Higher investments by clients in digital transformation, AI and automation are an upside. The solid traction of its Cobalt cloud portfolio is another positive. The latest forecast for worldwide IT spending by Gartner is an upside for Infosys as well.However, the company is suffering from increasing anti-outsourcing sentiments in certain countries. Higher subcontractor costs and compensation revision with higher variable pay and incentives are weighing on its margins.

        "Text": "Italy's tax authorities have confiscated \u20ac121m ($131m) from e-commerce giant Amazon\u2019s Italian unit over alleged tax and labour offences, Reuters has reported.\nIn a 94-page document, the Milan Prosecutors' Office accused Amazon Italy Transport of evading tax and labour regulations by engaging cooperatives and limited liability companies to supply workers.\nThese entities reportedly failed to fulfil value-added tax obligations and decreased social security contributions, allowing Amazon to offer competitive pricing within the Italian market.\nIn response, Amazon stated that it has maintained compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\nThe company declared: \"We comply with all applicable laws and regulations where we operate and require companies who work with us to do the same.

The results will incorporate Amazon's latest Prime Day sales event, which the company called its biggest ever.\nAmazon\u2019s second-quarter net sales totaled $147.98 billion, up 10% year-over-year and below expectations of $148.67 billion.

        "Text": "It\u2019s no surprise that when companies dominate their industries, their stock prices tend to have long-term success.\nApple and Amazon are two of the most widely discussed names when it comes to business success, as they both have a total market cap over a trillion dollars and currently rank as the first and fourth largest companies in America. While both of those stocks are likely to remain long-term winners, investors looking to get a little more bang for their buck might want to consider smaller, faster-growing companies to add to their investment portfolios.\nHere\u2019s a look at 10 stocks that could be the next Apple or Amazon in terms of rising to prominence in their industry and providing investors with solid long-term returns \u2014 perhaps even on their way to joining the trillion-dollar club. Be sure to consult with your financial advisor before investing, as investing in individual stocks is always risky and some of these names could be considered speculative. Stock prices are current as of July 17, 2024.\nAlso find out which stocks are considered the \u201cMagnificent Seven.\u201d\nFind Out: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t Sell\nBe Aware: 5 Subtly Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nPrice: $71.85\nPayment processor Block, known as Square until a name change in late 2021, has been a long-term winner since going public. If you\u2019ve ever paid for anything at a local merchant\u2019s shop, odds are, you\u2019ve been exposed to Square, which offers a range of financial services to small businesses and merchants.\nBut the underlying business fundamentals of the company remain strong, presenting investors with what might be an attractive entry point.\nAccording to James Allsopp, CEO of iNet Ventures, \u201cIts growth potential in digital payments and financial technology makes it a solid pick.\u201d\nFor You: In 5 Years, These 2 Stocks Will Be More Valuable Than Apple\nLearn More: 10 Things You Should Do When Your Child\u2019s 529 Account Reaches $20,000\nWealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.\nPrice: $64.81\nIn the last few quarters, the e-commerce stock has been dealing with a much more challenging environment than it faced in the height of the pandemic. Under these circumstances, growth has slowed and Shopify has had to take measures to cut costs.\nDespite some slowdowns, experts like Ameed Alachi, CEO and founder of NFC Tagify, still say that e-commerce is a booming industry. \u201cE-commerce is not slowing down and Shopify\u2019s platform takes the pulse of entrepreneurs and businesses starting and scaling online. Its strong ecosystem and innovation capabilities make it one of the top stocks,\u201d he said.\nDiscover Next: I\u2019m an Investor: I\u2019m Making These Money Moves Immediately If Trump Wins\nPrice: $461.99\nThe last few years have been a real roller coaster for the company formerly known as Facebook.\nAfter Mark Zuckerberg went all-in on the \u201cmetaverse,\u201d including a name change and tens of billions of dollars of spending, investors left the stock in droves and the price cratered, going from nearly $380 a share to a low near $88.\nThe company has since stepped back, with Zuckerberg signaling that the business would put more focus back on its advertising business, which actually makes money.\nIt\u2019s impossible to predict if Meta\u2019s virtual reality ambitions will come to fruition, but the stock has already climbed back and there\u2019s reason to believe it\u2019s on a path back to a trillion-dollar valuation.\nPrice: $69.64\nSea Limited has often been dubbed the \u201cAmazon of Southeast Asia\u201d and that alone makes it worth watching.\nBut the company\u2019s still-rapid growth and plans to expand its e-commerce offering to Latin America and Europe could prove to be huge opportunities for the company.\nIn addition to its popular e-commerce site Shopee, the company also draws revenue from its mobile game publisher Garena and its payment processing platform Sea Money.\nPrice: \u00a0$117.99\nNvidia has been a tech market leader for years now and its growth seems unstoppable. The chip maker has been in the right place with the right product at the right time and its stock price has reflected this.\nAccording to Allsopp, this frontrunner in GPU and AI computing technology is a worthy investment because it can \u201cexploit exploding demand for high-performance computers across industries, from gaming and PCs to data centers.\u201d\nAmong other things, Nvidia produces graphics processing units (GPUs) that are essential to the video game industry and are used to mine cryptocurrencies. The company also produces chip sets that power everything from robotics to self-driving cars. As all of these AI-adjacent industries are hot growth areas, Nvidia seems likely to continue at its torrid pace.\nCheck Out: 3 Types of Investments Predicted To Plummet in Value in Summer 2024\nPrice: $148.00\nAirbnb is already a titan in a very highly fragmented industry. One of its key competitive advantages is an asset-light business model \u2014 it acts as a platform to connect guests and hosts rather than owning and operating its own hotels or vacation homes.\nIn the long-term, Airbnb\u2019s success will depend on the uncertain future of the travel industry, but if you are optimistic about that future, you now have the opportunity to buy Airbnb\u2019s stock.\nPrice: $23.80\nEverquote is definitely a high-risk, high-reward play. The online provider of insurance quotes provides aggregated information from a variety of providers to allow consumers to choose where they want to buy their auto, home, medical, life, renters or commercial insurance products.\nIf the company can execute on its vision to be the dominant provider of online insurance quotes, it could end up being the Amazon of its industry.\nPrice: $2.72\nCalled the \u201cAmazon of houses\u201d by some, Opendoor Technologies is a potentially very risky stock that could be a huge winner if it can manage its business successfully over the long run.\nThe online real estate innovator went public in the summer of 2020 and the stock rose quickly, but when fears over high-growth stocks with no profits took over the market at the end of 2021, Opendoor got swept up in the selloff.\nBelievers cite the company\u2019s strong growth rate in a nascent industry that has the potential to become the \u201cnew normal\u201d for real estate transactions. However, currently the company is not profitable and there are no guarantees it will get there.

        "Title": "Why Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best Edge Computing Stock Right Now?",
        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Edge Computing Market Size and 7 Best Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other edge computing stocks.\nThe information technology sector has consistently outperformed investor and analyst expectations in 2023, and this trend appears to be continuing into the current year. This impressive performance can largely be attributed to significant advancements such as the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI, which have driven tech stock prices to unprecedented highs. Of course, AI is not the only area that is revolutionizing the technology space. Edge Computing comes in as another compelling area of growth and investment. Also known as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) or Multi-Access Edge Computing, Edge Computing focuses on bringing computing power closer to where data is generated, rather than relying on a centralized cloud-based system. In layman's terms, Edge Computing involves relocating part of the storage and computing capabilities from a central data center to locations near the data sources.\nBy keeping computational capacity close to users, devices, or data sources, edge solutions offer benefits such as reduced latency, increased bandwidth, local device processing, and data offloading. For instance, smart speakers perform minimal computational work, sending requests to servers owned by the provider. With Edge Computing, smart speakers could process a user\u2019s request entirely on the device itself. Gartner, in its March 2024 Market Guide for Edge Computing, states:\n\u201cBy placing data, data management capabilities and analytic workloads at optimal points, ranging all the way to endpoint devices, enterprises can enable more real-time use cases. In addition, the flexibility to move data management workloads up and down the continuum from centralized data centers or from the cloud-to-edge devices will enable greater optimization of resources.\u201d\nThe automotive industry is a prime example of rapid advancements driven by edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI) integration in recent years. As vehicles evolve to incorporate self-driving capabilities, these technologies have become essential for effective decision-making and real-time responses. For instance, Tesla leverages extensive real-world driving data to refine its AI algorithms for autonomous driving. The rollout of EV maker's Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to more drivers highlights its performance in real-world conditions, with the vast amount of visual data collected during these drives enhancing the company's AI learning process.\nFurthermore, the advent and adoption of 5G, the fifth generation of cellular network technologies offering substantially greater bandwidth, is accelerating the growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and facilitating the widespread adoption of edge computing. With 5G networks enabling lightning-fast speeds and a greater number of connected devices, data volumes are expected to surge. Predictions state that by 2025, every connected person will interact with digital data at least once every 18 seconds, largely due to the billions of IoT devices projected to generate over 90 zettabytes of data by then.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global edge computing market was valued at $15.96 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from $21.41 billion in 2024 to $216.76 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate of 33.6% over the forecast period. This growth is fueled by the increasing adoption of edge devices, ranging from IoT devices such as mobile point-of-sale kiosks and smart cameras to computational infrastructure that enables faster and real-time data analysis at the source. On the other hand, PwC projects that the global market for edge data centers will nearly triple, growing from $4 billion in 2017 to $13.5 billion this year. This expansion is driven by the potential of locally situated data centers to reduce latency, manage intermittent connections, and facilitate data storage and computation close to end-users.\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best edge computing stocks to buy now.\nOur Methodology\nFor our list of the best edge computing stocks, We began by sifting through ETFs' holdings and online rankings to gather a preliminary list of 15 stocks. We then scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s first-quarter database which tracks 920 elite money managers and selected the top seven that were the most widely held by hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading American multinational technology company with a diverse portfolio, including e-commerce, cloud computing via Amazon Web Services (AWS), online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. Notably, AWS offers edge computing services as part of its cloud solutions.\nInsider Monkey\u2019s research for the March quarter of 2024 revealed that 302 out of the 919 hedge funds tracked held stakes in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The largest hedge fund investor was Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management, with a stake valued at $7.67 billion.\nOn June 14, JPMorgan reiterated its Overweight rating on Amazon.com, Inc.

Amazon reported strong results during the quarter. Losses in the Core Retail business significantly narrowed. Amazon reduced its cost to serve on a per unit basis for the first time since 2018 as the company\u2019s recent regionalization efforts continue to bear fruit.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best edge computing stocks to buy.

Advertising services revenue for Q2 is projected to leap 22% to $13 billion with AWS revenue expected to spike 17% to $25.86 billion.\nNotably, Amazon is still the largest cloud provider ahead of its Magnificent Seven peers Microsoft MSFT\u00a0and Alphabet GOOGL. Overall, Amazon\u2019s Q2 sales are thought to have risen 10% to $148.63 billion versus $134.38 billion in the comparative quarter.\nOn the bottom line, Q2 EPS is expected to increase 63% to $1.03 compared to $0.63 per share a year ago. Plus, the Zacks ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) indicates Amazon could surpass earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate having Q2 EPS slated at $1.08 and 4% above the Zacks Consensus.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon has surpassed bottom line expectations for six consecutive quarters posting a very impressive average earnings surprise of 48.17% in its last four quarterly reports.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nReasonable Valuation\nWith Amazon\u2019s growth outpacing most of its big tech counterparts outside of Nvidia NVDA, the tech giant\u2019s valuation has become more reasonable as well. After trading at very stretched premiums in the past it's noteworthy that Amazon\u2019s stock has a \u201cB\u201d Zacks Style Scores grade for Value. \u00a0\nTo that point, AMZN is currently trading near its cheapest P/E valuation with a forward earnings multiple of 39.7X. This is pleasantly below its five-year high of 161.3X and a 44% discount to the median of 71.8X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nYTD Performance Comparison\nOnly trailing Nvidia and Meta Platform\u2019s META\u00a0price performance, Amazon\u2019s stock is up +20% year to date to roughly match Alphabet while topping the rest of its Magnificent Seven peers and\u00a0the broader indexes.\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nGiven its far more reasonable valuation and compelling growth, Amazon\u2019s stock certainly looks poised for more upside if the e-commerce and cloud behemoth can indeed reach or exceed Q2 earnings expectations.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  HALELUYA HADERO ",
        "Text": "Amazon is responsible under federal safety law for hazardous products sold on its platform by third-party sellers and shipped by the company, a U.S. government agency ordered Tuesday.\nIn a unanimous vote, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said it determined that the e-commerce company was a \u201cdistributor\u201d of faulty items sold on its site and packed and shipped through its fulfillment service.\nThat means the company is on the hook, legally, for the recalls of more than 400,000 products, including hairdryers and defective carbon monoxide detectors, the agency said. It ordered Amazon to come up with a system for notifying customers who purchased faulty items and to remove the products from circulation by offering incentives for their return or destruction.\nAmazon said it planned to appeal the decision in court.\nOverall, Amazon accounts for roughly 40% of e-commerce sales in the U.S., according to the market research firm Emarketer. The company sells many items directly to consumers and also partners with nearly 2 million third-party sellers, who drive the majority of the sales on the platform.\nThe online retailer has fought the \u201cdistributor\u201d label since 2021, when it was sued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission for allegedly distributing hazardous items.\nWhen Amazon was notified about the deficient products three years ago, the company \u201cswiftly\" notified customers, told them to stop using the items and issued refunds, Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said.\nBut the agency said the company \u201cdid not take adequate steps to encourage\u201d customers to return or destroy the products, leaving them at risk of injury. In the messages it sent, the company claimed the faulty products had \u201cpotential\u201d safety issues and provided customers with Amazon.com credits rather than refunds, the agency said.\nAmazon had argued before an administrative law judge and the five-person commission that it shouldn\u2019t be classified as a distributor under the Consumer Product Safety Act. The commission said the judge rejected the company's argument, and Tuesday\u2019s order was an affirmation of that decision.\n"

The ruling won\u2019t be released to the public until next week because the state agency is reviewing it and redacting non-public information.\nAmazon, which received an unredacted version of the ruling since it\u2019s one of the parties involved, said the judge determined the state lacked sufficient evidence to support its allegations that the pace of work in Amazon warehouses is hazardous.\n\u201cWe appreciate that the court took a close look at the facts about how we prioritize employees\u2019 health and safety, recognized the progress we\u2019ve made, and vacated all the citations at the heart of this case,\u201d Amazon said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe judge\u2019s decision reinforces what we\u2019ve said all along: There\u2019s nothing more important than our employees\u2019 health and safety.\u201d\nDepartment of Labor and Industries spokesperson Matt Ross said the agency plans to appeal the decision. \u201cOur investigation showed that Amazon did not protect their workers,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWe disagree both with the judge\u2019s characterization of the facts and interpretation of the law.\nThe state\u2019s case was based on investigations that began in 2021. Investigators spent three days observing more than 50 Amazon workers performing 12 tasks and found hazards in nearly every one. Employees surveyed by the inspectors said pushing through pain was the norm, with some 40% saying they\u2019d experienced it in the previous seven days. Of those, two-thirds said they took medication to ease symptoms.\nBased on the investigation, the labor department alleged 10-hour shifts with mandatory overtime and a rapid work pace put workers at risk of hurting their backs, shoulders, wrists and knees.\nThe ruling is a major victory for Amazon, which for years has been defending the safety of its warehouses in the face of growing government scrutiny. Federal regulators in 2022 cited Amazon for exposing workers to a range of musculoskeletal maladies and for failing to provide adequate medical treatment, which Amazon appealed.\nCalifornia, New York, Minnesota and several other states have passed or are considering new laws crafted to help prevent industry productivity quotas from interfering with legally required meal and rest breaks. The California Department of Industrial Relations issued two citations against Amazon in May, alleging the company violated the new law that took effect in 2022.\n(Updates with comments from labor department spokesperson in the sixth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship\nScammers Target Middle East Influencers With Meta\u2019s Own Tools\nThe Miseducation of America\u2019s Nurse Practitioners\nHow Sonny Angels and Smiskis Took Over TikTok\nJoe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy\u2019s New Kingmaker\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Chris Katje ",
        "Text": "Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos is selling another portion of his stake in the company, which comes years after stepping down from the CEO role.\nWhat Happened: Bezos departed from Amazon\u2019s c-suite in 2021, a role he held for the 27 years since the company was founded. The Amazon founder now serves as the e-commerce giant\u2019s executive chair. He\u2019s been selling a portion of his Amazon stake this year.\nDon't Miss:\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nMiami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city before that happens.\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nBezos sold $8.5 billion in shares in February. A Tuesday SEC filing by Amazon shows Bezos plans on selling 25 million Amazon shares valued at $4.93 billion.\nThe new sale would bring Bezos\u2019 total sold to around $13.4 billion in stock in 2024. Bezos owns around 9% of Amazon shares, according to a report from the Financial Times.\nWhat's Next: Bezos could be selling shares for a number of reasons. The Amazon founder is spending more time working on his space company Blue Origin and other ventures.\nBezos is also set to wed Lauren Sanchez and has spent more time vacationing aboard his $500 million yacht Koru, which costs $25 million annually to operate.\nSpeculation could grow that Bezos is raising cash to make a push to own a National Football League team. Bezos was previously linked with making a bid for the Washington Commanders, a D.C.-based NFL team.\nReports said Bezos may have been blocked from bidding due to a personal grudge held by former Commanders owner Daniel Snyder. In the end, Bezos didn't formally bid on the team and the Commanders were sold to a group for $6.05 billion.\nTrending: How do billionaires pay less in income tax than you? Tax deferring is their number one strategy.\nThe sale was the largest in sports history, but could be topped if more NFL teams are sold in the future.\nBezos has been linked to making a push to buying the Seattle Seahawks. A previous Washington Post report said NFL owners support Bezos joining the league.\n\"Other owners have expressed a desire for Bezos to buy a team. Bezos could get that opportunity if he pursues the Seattle Seahawks. That team is expected to be sold in the coming years,\" the report said.\nThe report said, \"Bezos knows that Seattle is sitting there.\"\nThe Seahawks, who were valued at $5 billion by Forbes last year, are owned by the Paul G. Allen Trust. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen previously owned the team before his death in 2018. The assets are expected to be sold in the coming years. Allen made instructions that the trust would be liquidated after his death with proceeds going to philanthropic efforts.\nWhile Bezos may have moved from Seattle to Florida, the Amazon founder will forever be linked to the Washington city and the Seahawks could lure him back to the city, at least on a part-time basis.\nOne lingering question mark could be whether the NFL would approve a sale to Bezos with Amazon.com having broadcast rights to Thursday Night Football games.\nBezos is worth $222 billion, ranking second in the world in wealth behind Elon Musk ($241 billion), according to Bloomberg.\nAMZN Price Action: Amazon shares are down 1% to $197.82 Wednesday after hitting new all-time highs of $200.43 on Tuesday.\nRead Next:\nElon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US.

        "Author": "  Omor Ibne Ehsan ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has more skin in the AI game than many people would like to think. Of course, the first thing that would spring to mind is the company\u2019s AWS cloud division. But it\u2019s important to also remember that Amazon has invested $4 billion into a company called Anthropic. Anthropic was founded by former members of OpenAI, Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei.\nIf you haven\u2019t heard about it yet, this company is behind an AI model called \u201cClaude.\u201d It is essentially a ChatGPT competitor, and I believe it is leaving OpenAI in the dust. Indeed, this model is much better at coding and understanding humans.\nAnthropic\u2019s Claude 3 dominated benchmarks this year, and while OpenAI took the crown back with GPT-4o, I believe we can safely say that Claude 3.5 Sonnet has taken the crown back again. This model features a huge jump in performance. Most impressively, it now has a feature called \u201cArtifacts.\u201d People can build websites, play games, and run code on a separate side window on Claude itself.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nI think it is a good idea to see how well this model does when it comes to stock-picking. So, I asked Claude 3.5 to list some stocks it thinks could turn \u201c$1K into $1M.\u201d Here are three it picked.\nSource: Mongkolchon Akesin / Shutterstock.com\nI usually stay away from biotech and startup pharma stocks, but again, these are Claude\u2019s choices. Recursion Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RXRX) is an AI-enabled drug discovery company that\u2019s using technology to revolutionize how we find and develop new medicines. The company has built an impressive pipeline spanning diverse therapeutic areas and has partnerships with leading biopharma players.\nRecursion is probably the best-positioned player in the AI drug discovery space, given its unique industrialized approach. CEO Chris Gibson thinks their strategy positions the company to achieve \u201cTechBio escape velocity\u201d in the coming years. This subtle but critical distinction between TechBio and traditional biotech likely drove Nvidia\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) recent $50 million investment.\nHowever, we can\u2019t ignore the risks with this stock. Like any pre-revenue biotech company, Recursion faces daunting cash burn and dilution risks. The stock could face a significant pullback if the market\u2019s enthusiasm for AI cools. That said, based on my analysis of their cutting-edge platform and robust data assets, I see huge potential upside for the stock.\nKey catalysts to watch in the second half include Phase 2 readouts for REC-994 in Q3 and REC-2282 in Q4. Positive data could supercharge another surge in its share price. But for now, Recursion remains a high-risk, high-reward bet on the future of drug development. I would only invest if you can afford to lose the money you put into this stock.\nSource: Chesky / Shutterstock\nLilium (NASDAQ:LILM) is developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for regional air mobility. I believe Lilium is a high-risk, high-reward play in the eVTOL space that could deliver explosive returns if it executes. The company has a business model targeting the most profitable parts of aviation.\nWhile Lilium currently generates minimal revenue, analysts expect sales to inflect sharply higher starting next year, potentially reaching $5 billion in 2032 if eVTOL adoption goes mainstream. Profitability could arrive by 2027. However, these projections remain highly speculative given the unproven nature of the eVTOL sector.\nOn the positive side, Lilium has $215 million in cash, which management believes provides sufficient runway to reach commercialization. This cash pile should also allow the company to avoid highly-dilutive funding if they deliver on their milestones. I\u2019d agree with Claude saying this is a buy. But again, that\u2019s only if you can stomach the potential downside risk.\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\nBeam Therapeutics (NASDAQ:BEAM) is a biotech company developing precision genetic medicines through base editing. The company made progress across its pipeline in Q1 2024, but this speculative stock still has a long way to go. Beam completed dosing for the sentinel cohort in its Phase 1/2 trial of BEAM-101 for severe sickle cell disease and advanced BEAM-302 with CTA clearance in the U.K. for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.\nWhile these are positive steps, Beam is still in its early innings of development, and is burning cash. Revenue declined 69% to just $7.4 million, missing estimates by more than $7 million. Additionally, the company posted a loss of $1.21 per share. However, on the plus side, Beam has a robust balance sheet with $1.1 billion in cash available to fund operations into 2027.\nI\u2019m skeptical that this is enough runway, and that Beam\u2019s sales potential is strong enough. I would not rate this a buy with the current level of losses the company is bringing in. Notably, gene editing and related therapies must take off for Beam to succeed. I believe CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ:CRSP) is a much better bet in this speculative space.\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Text": "\"I believe in buying great companies -- especially companies that are undervalued, and/or underappreciated.\"\n-- Peter Lynch\nIt doesn't matter what you're buying -- clothes, groceries, a home -- everyone wants a good deal. And the same is true with stocks. No one wants to overpay for an investment.\nYet, identifying whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued is more complex than it may seem. Granted, every stock has a price, but that isn't enough to determine value. \nFor example, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has a price -- a market cap, that is -- of about $1.2 trillion at the moment. But it appears undervalued, and its market cap could surge to more than $2 trillion soon.\nTo understand why Meta Platform's stock is undervalued, you must first understand the company's business model: It is one of two companies that between them control the lion's share of the digital advertising market (Alphabet, the parent company of Google, being the other).\nIn fact, in the first quarter, Meta reported over 3 billion daily active users -- roughly 38% of the global population. This massive user base allows it to place countless ads across its platforms, most notably on Facebook and Instagram. Meta generated $35.6 billion of ad revenue in the first quarter alone.\nBest of all for the company and its shareholders, much of that revenue is converted into profits. Meta's net income rose to $12.4 billion in Q1 -- up 117% from a year earlier.\nSimilarly, Meta's free cash flow is growing, too. Over the last 12 months, the company has reported nearly $50 billion in free cash flow. On a per-share basis, Meta now delivers $18.82 in free cash flow, up from $6.60 less than two years ago.\nUltimately, it's Meta's free cash flow that makes the company's stock a bargain right now. \nIn the final analysis, all common stocks offer investors the same value proposition. When investors buy a stock, they gain an ownership stake in a portion of the company's future profits and cash flows.\nThat's why understanding valuation metrics is so important when investing in individual stocks -- investors have to know how to make apples-to-apples comparisons.\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the valuation metric that stands out is its price-to-free-cash-flow ratio, which gauges its ability to generate cash for shareholders. Here's how Meta's ratio stacks up against a couple of its megacap peers.\nAs you can see, Meta has remained cheaper than Alphabet over the last six months and is well below Amazon's ratio. This all matters because, as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has noted, rising free cash flow per share is crucial to the long-term success of any business. Often, the faster a company grows its free cash flow, the faster its stock price will rise. Based on its free cash flow growth, Meta's stock price should be higher.\nAnd you can see this when it comes to Meta's recent stock performance. Year to date, Meta is up 35%, Alphabet is up 27%, and Amazon is up 21%.\nFor Meta to reach a $2 trillion market cap, its stock would need to rise by about 67%. Not only do I think that's possible, I believe it is likely. \nMeta went public in 2012. Over the last 12 years, its stock price has grown by 1,150% -- a compound annual rate of 23%. If its growth from here matches that average rate, Meta's market cap will hit $2 trillion in early 2027.\nThat timeline may be a bit too ambitious, as Meta has suffered some setbacks over the last few years, including a 77% share price plunge back in 2022. Nevertheless, the company has more than recovered from that bear market and remains one of the world's premier digital advertising companies. In addition, it is investing tens of billions into innovative technologies like artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the metaverse.\nIn summary, Meta Platforms may take longer than three years to reach the $2 trillion club, but it's still likely to get there one day.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  James Davey ",
        "Text": "By James Davey\nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain's grocery regulator on Thursday threatened Amazon with a formal investigation if it does not improve its compliance with an industry code designed to protect suppliers.\nThe Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA) said its 2024 annual survey found that less than half of respondents directly supplying Amazon believed the U.S. giant \"consistently\" or \"mostly\" complied with the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP).\nThe Code aims to ensure Britain's 14 largest grocery retailers, including market leader Tesco, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer, treat suppliers fairly. Amazon has been subject to it since 2022.\nIt restricts firms from making changes to supply contracts at short notice and also requires retailers to give an appropriate period of notice if they no longer want to use a supplier and provide reasons for ending the contract.\nAmazon\u2019s perceived Code compliance score fell to 47% from 59% in 2023, with Amazon retaining its position in last place some 41 percentage points behind Iceland on 88% in 13th place.\n\"We are very disappointed by these results and we are committed to improving them,\" an Amazon spokesperson said.\nThe GCA said it had told Amazon to take \"swift and comprehensive action\" to demonstrably comply with the Code.\nThe regulator is monitoring changes that Amazon is making and their impact to determine whether they are sufficient.\n\"I will not hesitate to launch a formal investigation if appropriate and necessary to ensure Amazon is treating its suppliers fairly and lawfully,\" said Mark White, the Groceries Code Adjudicator.\nUltimately, the GCA can impose financial penalties of up to 1% of a large retailer's UK turnover.\nThe Amazon spokesperson said it had made several improvements for grocery suppliers since last year\u2019s results, with clearer explanations for cost price increase decisions, minimum periods for de-listing, and the launch of a major upgrade for handling invoice disputes.\n\u201cWe will be making further changes, with faster time-frames to resolve more types of financial disputes, as well as strengthened account management support for smaller suppliers,\" the person said.The GCA said overall Code compliance scores across the retailers, excluding Amazon, averaged 94%, unchanged from 2023.\n(Reporting by James Davey; Editing by Mark Potter)\n"

        "Author": "  Asra Isar ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of Billionaire Phillipe Laffont\u2019s Top 10 \u201cMostly AI\u201d Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Philippe Laffont's other stock picks.\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont is a Founder & Portfolio Manager at Coatue Management, L.L.C. His fund\u2019s top 10 holdings comprise of mostly tech stocks which depicts his love for technology. His thirst for technology was such that after graduating from MIT with a computer science degree he applied for a job at Apple multiple times but was rejected every time. This pushed him towards another calling, which was to manage a hedge fund and its holdings.\nPhilippe Laffont\u2019s journey towards investing started when he moved to Spain where he started working at McKinsey. It was at this time when he learned about the \u201cboom of the PC\u201d and about the three pioneers of PC industry namely IBM, Dell and Microsoft. He decided to invest in these stocks which churned out more money than he was earning at that time. This led to his endeavors as an investor. In order to learn more about being an investor he got a chance to work at a mutual fund without pay where he learned about different terminologies related to the industry to \u201cget his foot in the door\u201d.\nAfter his employment ended in Julian Robertson\u2019s organization, he moved on to gather funds to start investing from his friends and family but most of his funds came from professional brokers and people who admired his entrepreneurial spirit. This led to the launch of his company on January 1, 2000, with $50 million at its disposal and the fund's AUM now stands at $50 billion. His investment philosophy is to provide longevity and good returns for the investors; and to have investors that would bet on him for the long term. Philippe Laffont\u2019s philosophy of helping out people is visible in his efforts to advise people on investing and he believes in helping any new tech \u201ckid\u201d that could become the next Tiktok.\nIn his interview at the Bloomberg Invest Philippe Laffont said that he is conflicted about whether small or big companies will be the AI winners. According to him the history of technology indicates that the big gets bigger but new companies have also made it through like Facebook or TikTok. He thinks that AI isn't overhyped and the valuations aren't out of whack right now. Here is what he said:\n\"It's true that the mentions of AI in every TV and and written form is very high. And so one could say, Wow, if everybody talks about it, it must be priced in. And the only reason why more positive is I remember when I invested in Apple in 2009 when the iPhone first came out and for years people told me, Why are you invested in Apple? Everybody talks about Apple. And obviously it had an incredible run. So I actually think that sometimes because someone speaks a lot about something, it might be actually a good sign versus an overhyped sign.\"\nPhilippe Laffont thinks the next phase of AI will be real estate with data centers and especially utilities with power. Another phase of AI, according to Philippe Laffont would be robots with artificial brains called humanoids. The technology hedge fund manager also made the following prediction which has a huge implication for the semiconductor stocks:\n\"I've made a lot of mistakes, You know, betting on these new technologies like AR/VR turns out to be not so big. 3D printing turns out to be not so big. My estimate is $100 trillion was invested in today's dollar in the PC, CPU based infrastructure. All this is going to get ripped out to put $100 trillion or more in our GPU based infrastructure.\"\nOur Methodology\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of Coatue Management at the end of the first quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the first quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nAmazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) witnessed an increase of 12.5% YoY in the first quarter revenue whereas its adjusted EPS more than tripled. In addition to AWS business generating operating margins above 37% in the first quarter, digital ads also contributed to Amazon.com, Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue as the segment reported an increase of 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. The largest shareholder in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), according to Insider Monkey's database of hedge funds, is Fisher Asset Management that holds 42 million shares worth over $7 billion while Coatue Management holds 10 million shares worth $1.8 billion. Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world\u2019s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon\u2019s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack \u2013 infrastructure with NVIDIA\u2019s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of billionaire Phillipe Laffont's top stock picks.

While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "A union for Amazon warehouse workers elects a new leader in wake of Teamsters affiliation",
        "Author": "  HALELUYA HADERO ",
        "Text": "Workers at Amazon's only unionized warehouse in the U.S. elected new union leaders, according to a vote count completed Tuesday, marking the first major change for the labor group since it established an alliance with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\nA slate of candidates headed up by a former Amazon worker named Connor Spence received the most votes cast by employees from the warehouse located in the New York City borough of Staten Island. Although turnout was very low, Spence received enough support to lead the Amazon Labor Union as it aims to secure a contract with a company that has resisted those efforts for years.\nSpence, a prominent organizer with the union, more recently led a dissident group that sued the union last year to force new leadership election amid internal strife. He was fired by Amazon last year for violating a company policy that forbids workers from accessing company buildings or outdoor work areas when they\u2019re off the clock, a policy critics say is designed to hinder organizing.\nOnly 5% of the 5,312 workers employed in the warehouse voted by mail-in ballot, said Arthur Schwartz, an attorney who represents the dissident group. Spence received 137 out of 247 votes cast, Schwartz said, defeating a current ALU officer named Claudia Ashterman and another prominent organizer named Michelle Valentin.\n\u201cAfter more than two years of fighting to reform our union to make it more democratic, transparent, and militant, we are relieved to finally be able to turn our attention toward bringing Amazon to the table and winning an incredible contract,\u201d Spence said in a statement.\nWorkers at the same warehouse voted overwhelmingly last month to affiliate with the Teamsters union, which agreed to provide the Amazon Labor Union, or ALU, with funding and other types of support until it negotiates a contract with Amazon and begins collecting member dues.\nThe affiliation agreement, a copy of which was reviewed by The Associated Press, says the ALU will be chartered as an \u201cautonomous\u201d local Teamsters union with the right to organize Amazon warehouse workers across New York City. The union branch, known as ALU-International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 1, also is expected to help with organizing Amazon warehouse workers elsewhere and to participate in strategy sessions.\n\u201cThe question is whether the outcome of the election, plus the Teamster affiliation, can create that kind of momentum needed among the rank-and-file,\u201d said Ruth Milkman, a sociologist of labor and labor movements at the City University of New York. \u201cBut even if it does, Amazon is going to fight it tooth-and-nail.\u201d\nSpence will take over the leadership role from Chris Smalls, a former Amazon worker. He spearheaded the first successful U.S. union organizing effort in the retail giant\u2019s history in 2022, when workers at the Staten Island warehouse voted in favor of ALU representation.\nHowever, organizers inside the union began questioning Smalls' strategy after the group suffered two subsequent election losses in New York and withdrew a petition for a union vote in California. Some left quietly, while others joined the dissident group headed up by Spence.\nSmalls did not seek reelection. Instead, he backed a slate of candidates headed up by Ashterman.\nSince mail-in ballots were sent to workers in early July, candidates vying for leadership spots had engaged in a fierce campaign during shift breaks and in public areas near the warehouse, formally known as the JFK8 Fulfillment Center. Morning and evening campaigning also took place in front of a bus stop near the facility.\nOn a recent evening, Spence and some members of the dissident group erected a small tent by the bus stop and handed out heat safety literature and cold bottles of water to workers starting or ending their 10-hour shifts. Other candidates set up a table where they played music or spoke with warehouse workers waiting to go home.\nSome workers stood there 45 minutes or longer while watching for a shuttle bus to come, a pain point known to candidates who campaigned on acquiring or fundraising for additional shuttles.\nSpence said in an interview earlier this month that joint strategy sessions with the Teamsters would happen once Local 1 has new leaders. But the powerful labor union already began offering support by footing the bill for the Amazon warehouse election and providing legal aid when needed.\nSpence said the Teamsters offered him legal support two weeks ago when Amazon called local police to an ALU rally held near the warehouse. During the rally, which some Teamsters organizers attended, officers arrested Spence and six other participants, saying they had blocked a driveway.\nAmazon spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis said the company had also asked non-employees to leave its property. But organizers say the demonstration was held on a patch of grass they believed to be public property and where they've previously held other rallies.\nSince the union's affiliation with the Teamsters, Amazon has made small changes around the warehouse, according to workers. The company, which employs methods to fend off labor unions, has installed gates around the building's parking lot and posted security guards to monitor everyone coming in and out of the lot.\nCompany spokesperson Paradis says Amazon took those extra steps for safety reasons and to deter trespassing incidents that have occurred in the past few weeks.\nAmazon continues to face worker unrest elsewhere, including in Kentucky, where employees at a large company Air Hub held a one-day strike last week in coordination with the Teamsters union. More than 100 contracted Amazon drivers in Chicago\u2019s northern suburbs have been on strike since late June demanding higher pay and better health care plans, according to the Teamsters.\nBut Amazon also has scored a few wins in the past few weeks.\nIn mid-July, warehouse workers in Britain narrowly rejected a union bid at a facility in Coventry, a city about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of London. If successful, it would have been the first union to ever form at an Amazon warehouse in the United Kingdom.\nMeanwhile, last week, a Washington state judge ruled in favor of the company in a high-profile worker safety case. Regulators had alleged in the case that Amazon put employees at unnecessary risk of injuries.\nIn Staten Island, the ALU dissident group has been trying get warehouse workers out of their comfort zones and energized around issues such as heat safety and Juneteenth, for which Amazon doesn\u2019t offer paid time off, Spence said.\nHe hopes the organizing work eventually will lead to a strike, which he thinks is the only thing that will get Amazon to the negotiating table. But, he also knows one unionized warehouse doesn\u2019t have enough leverage.\n\u201cTo get them to the table, it has to be a national organizing campaign,\u201d Spence said. \u201cWe have to identify strategic choke points, organize those warehouses and go on strike simultaneously.\u201d\nSchwartz, the attorney, said the local union's new leaders will be sworn in on Wednesday.\n"

        "Author": "  Numerator ",
        "Text": "New Retail Sales Analysis Shows Amazon Dominating July Events; Target and Walmart See Double Digit Boosts in October Events\nCHICAGO, July 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Numerator, a data and tech company serving the market research space, has released findings on Prime Day 2024 based on its new report, The Opportunity and Impact of Digital Sales Events, which analyzes six key online retail events in the US from Amazon, Walmart, and Target. In 2023, July sales events overlapped for all three retailers and lifted omnichannel traffic by 11% overall, compared to the average week. Amazon benefited the most from its July Prime Day event, while Target and Walmart saw better traffic and sales with their October Circle Week and Holiday Kickoff events, respectively. The analysis leverages verified purchase data from these retail sales events, as well as sentiment surveys of these same buyers.\nKey Findings Include: \n2 in 5 US households are expected to shop Prime Day 2024. In July 2023, 40% of consumers shopped at least one online sales event, with nearly all of these consumers shopping on Prime Day 2023. These July event shoppers were 11% more likely than the average shopper to be Gen X or Millennial and 23% more likely to have children aged 0\u20135.\nPre-event awareness drives event success \u2013 especially for Prime Day. 100% of Amazon Prime Day 2023 shoppers said they were aware that the event was happening, doubling Amazon\u2019s average household penetration of 21% to 40.1% on Prime Day (a 91% lift). In comparison, 88% of Target Circle Week shoppers were aware of the event (+26% lift in penetration for Target.com) and 56% of Walmart+ Week shoppers were aware (+6% for Walmart.com).\nConsumers are split on their feelings regarding retail sales events throughout the year. 35% of respondents said there are too many events, 33% said they wish there were more events, and 32% said the number of events is just right.\nMore than half of Prime Day 2024 shoppers will likely be comparing prices on other retailers \u2013 but still buying on Amazon. On Prime Day 2023, 54% of shoppers said they compared prices at other retailers before purchasing. However, despite price comparisons, most shoppers bought at Amazon. 78% of July retail event shoppers purchased on Amazon only, 6.7% purchased on Amazon and Walmart.com, 5.5% purchased on Amazon and Target.com, 5.7% purchased only on Walmart.com, and 3.5% purchased only on Target.com.\nThe majority of Prime Day 2024 shoppers will be looking for low prices and item variety. While the top cited reason for shopping at a retailer's sales event is price (75% of shoppers), 57% want a wide variety of items on sale, 44% want fast shipping, 39% like the online shopping experience, and 37% want an easy return process.\nCPG brands are poised to continue their Prime Day growth this year. Three consumable departments (pet supplies, beverages, and vitamins & supplements) made the top seven departments purchased during Prime Day 2023, compared to just one consumable making the top seven in 2019.\nConsumable products are likely to appear in the Prime Day 2024 top items list. Two consumables were in the top five items purchased during Prime Day 2023. Temptations Cat Food and Liquid IV were the second and fourth most purchased items during Amazon\u2019s July 2023 event, respectively.\nWalmart and Target\u2019s July 2024 events are unlikely to top their October sale events. In October 2023, Amazon saw 12% less household penetration during their Prime Big Deal Days event compared to their July Prime Day event. In contrast, Walmart saw a 15% increase and Target saw a 21% increase on their October events compared to their July events.\nWalmart is top of mind when it comes to holiday sales events. 74% of consumers said they think of Walmart for holiday sale events (+25 percentage points vs. non-holiday sales events), and 58% think of Target for holiday sale events (+19 points). Comparatively, 70% of people think of Amazon for holiday sales events (-9 points).\nOctober events play an important role in building retailer loyalty. Compared to non-sales event shoppers, Target.com shoppers are 2.6x more loyal to Target.com if they shopped the 2023 October Circle Week. Walmart.com\u2019s shoppers are 2.5x more loyal if they shopped the 2023 Holiday Kickoff event, and Amazon\u2019s shoppers are 1.6x more loyal if they shopped the retailer\u2019s Prime Big Deal Days in October.\nNumerator\u2019s\u00a0Amazon Prime Day Tracker will provide real-time coverage of the 2024 event, on July 16 and 17, including average order size, orders per household, top items purchased, consumer sentiment around the sale, and more.\nAbout Numerator:\nNumerator is a data and tech company bringing speed and scale to market research.\u00a0 Numerator blends first-party data from over 1 million US households with advanced technology to provide 360-degree consumer understanding for the market research industry that has been slow to change.

        "Text": "By Dawn Chmielewski\n(Reuters) -Warner Bros Discovery's sports network TNT Sports said on Monday it would exercise its rights to match one of three bids to carry National Basketball Association games, in an effort to preserve its four-decade-long partnership with the league.\nTNT Sports did not say which of the NBA programming packages it was seeking to match, however one source familiar with the offer said the company is seeking to match Amazon Prime Video's offer of $1.9 billion per season, on average, over the life of the 11-year deal.\nAmazon declined to comment, referring inquiries to the NBA, which could not be immediately reached.\nTNT Sports' announcement comes days after the league informed team owners it had finalized deals with Walt Disney's ESPN, Comcast's NBCUniversal and Amazon. The deal is reportedly valued at $76 billion, and takes effect after the 2024-25 season.\nThe league notified Warner's sports unit last week, triggering a five-day period to inform the NBA whether it would seek to match one of the bids, according to the source.\n\"We have reviewed the offers and matched one of them,\" TNT said in a statement. \"This will allow fans to keep enjoying our unparalleled coverage.\"\nTNT described the matching provision an \"integral part\" of its current contract, which it has paid for. If the NBA rejected the matching bid, it could result in legal action.\nThe bid is \"a risky move that could anger the NBA and sour WBD's reputation among other sports leagues that it may be interested in doing business with,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Ross Benes.\n\"However, the NBA is so valuable to the company that desperate measures may be warranted.\"\nThe Warner unit has been bulking up its sports programming, in June announcing a six-year deal with the Big East Conference to carry men's and women's college basketball and a decade-long agreement with the French Tennis Federation to carry the French Open.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru, Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Rod Nickel and Stephen Coates)\n"

(NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos sold more shares of the e-commerce giant, a late-Tuesday filing by the company with the SEC showed.\nWhat Happened: Bezos reported three tranches of stock sales, two of which were done on Monday and the third one on Friday. The details of the transactions are as follows:\n3,085,116 shares divested Friday at an average price of $200.07\n1,171,794 shares at $200.33 apiece and 57,199 shares at $201.05 per share on Monday.\nDon't Miss:\u00a0\nThis Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\n1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ, how many people got started through this free crypto faucet?\nThe selling was in conformance with the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by Bezos on March 2.

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): A Good Stock to Buy According to Peconic Partners?",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 191.50% in 3 Years: Peconic Hedge Fund's Top 10 Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks.\nEstablished in 1997, Peconic Partners is a hedge fund manager based in New York, under the leadership of William Harnisch. The firm manages both its capital and that of its clients, using long/short equity hedge fund strategies. It also follows a thematic investment approach with a structured and consistent methodology, aiming to achieve positive returns over the long term regardless of market conditions.\nPeconic Partners's stock selection approach is driven by its deep experience. The Peconic Partners investment strategy has a history spanning over 40 years, originating with its predecessor firm. Peconic Partners' long-term track record, history of capital appreciation, and past ability to generate alpha are testaments to the vision, insight, and patience derived from their experience.\nWilliam Harnisch is the Chief Investment Strategist at Peconic Partners. He managed Peconic Partners from the late 1970s until 1997 when the long-only business was sold to a privately-held financial services firm aiming to expand its asset management business. However, William Harnisch and his partners retained exclusive ownership of the hedge business. In December 2004, he and the current Peconic team formed Peconic Partners, continuing the successful and disciplined hedge fund strategy practiced since the late 1970s.\nMr. Harnisch's career began in 1968 at Chase Manhattan Bank. He later joined Forstmann-Leff Associates (FLA), managing assets exceeding $5 billion and entering the hedge fund business in 1986. In 1997, he sold FLA's long-only business and in 2004, he founded Peconic Partners to concentrate on hedged products. William Harnisch holds a B.B.A. from Baruch College and is a Chartered Financial Analyst. He is active in philanthropy through the William F. Harnisch Foundation and is a board member of the Baruch College Fund. His market insights have been featured in the Wall Street Journal and Barron\u2019s.\nIn 2023, Peconic Partners LLC regained the top spot on HedgeFollow's Top 20 Best Performing Hedge Funds list. Despite challenges like rising inflation and market volatility, Peconic Partners delivered a remarkable 191.50% performance over three years. This achievement is significant as many money managers struggled during a surprising market rally. While only 38% of large-cap mutual funds beat the market in 2023, and long-short hedge funds saw minimal gains, Peconic Partners excelled. For the fourth year in a row, the New York-based fund achieved an annual gain of 38%, three times higher than the S&P 500\u2019s performance.\nIn late December of 2023, Mr. Harnisch increased bets against the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust and took short positions in expensive industrial stocks and consumer-product makers that have raised prices aggressively. This caused the fund's net leverage to decrease from 50% to 33% in a few weeks, and it has continued to drop in early 2024.\nOur Methodology\nThe companies mentioned in this article come from Peconic Hedge Fund's top 10 stock picks at the end of the first quarter of 2024. To give readers a thorough understanding of these companies, we've included analyst ratings and other relevant details. We also mention the number of hedge fund investors in each company. Why focus on the stocks that hedge funds invest in? Our research shows that mimicking the top picks of the best hedge funds can lead to market-beating returns. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy, which selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks each quarter, has returned 275% since May 2014, outperforming its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading global e-commerce platform and major player in cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS), benefiting from the increasing use of cloud services by businesses. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also expanding its offerings in AI, logistics, and digital streaming, which supports its growth and market opportunities. With accelerating growth in AI cloud and advertising, management anticipates a significant increase in capital expenditure for FY2024, primarily to expand AWS infrastructure.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has demonstrated strong financial performance, with revenue rising to $514 billion in 2023 from $469 billion in 2022, and profit margins improving. Analysts note that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s EV/Sales ratio is in line with its 5-year average, and its non-GAAP P/E ratio for FY2024 is consistent with the Nasdaq 100 index. While Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) focuses on high-growth areas like AI, cloud computing, and advertising, retail sales still account for 82.5% of its revenue. As of the end of Q1 2024, Peconic Partners had a $718K position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN).\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc.

Amazon is adopting the same approach to the next front, GenAI, from custom AI chips and training/deployment services to empower companies to construct their own core GenAI models, to their Bedrock service which allows customers to use pre-existing models to more quickly develop applications, to Amazon developing their own applications for internal use (think Alexa and a new shopping AI called Rufus).\nOverall AMZN ranks 10th on our list of Peconic Partners' top 10 stock picks.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced on Thursday that Prime Video will become the exclusive streaming partner for a significant portion of NBA games starting in the 2025-26 season. The dramatic new agreement will span 11 years, marking Amazon's largest sports content agreement to date.\nKey Takeaways:\nNBA and Amazon have struck a deal to broadcast games on Prime Video for 11 years, starting in 2025. Amazon emerged victorious in a competitive bidding process, highlighting its growing prowess in live sports content production. With a growing subscriber base, improved ad sales capabilities, and integrated Prime shopping experiences, Amazon is well-positioned to cover the incremental licensing costs.\nDetails of the Deal: According to analysts at BofA, the deal grants Prime Video exclusive streaming rights to 66 regular-season NBA games, the Emirates NBA Cup, and crucial playoff games over the 11-year term. The agreement is also notable for its international reach, offering expanded coverage in nations including Mexico, Brazil, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, the UK, and Ireland for six out of the 11 years.\n\u26a0\ufe0fTrack your favorite companies with InvestingPro! Our Summer Sale is now on, use coupon code INVPRODEAL and save over 50%!\u26a0\ufe0f\nAdditionally, Prime Video will stream 30 WNBA regular-season games exclusively, and Prime Video Channels will serve as the strategic partner and global store destination for NBA League Pass and WNBA League Pass. Expect live pregame, postgame, and halftime shows, as well as coverage of the NBA Summer League and NBA G League games.\nChallenging Competition: The NBA's selection of Amazon over Warner Bros' TNT highlights the competitive nature of this bidding process. The New York Post reports that TNT had attempted to match Amazon's offer, but the NBA claimed TNT \"did not match the terms.\" In contrast, TNT argued that the NBA had \"grossly misinterpreted our contractual rights\" and might contest the deal.\nFinancial Implications for Amazon: The financial commitment from Amazon is substantial, with the New York Times reporting an annual payment of approximately $1.8 billion over the 11-year period.\nBofA projects Amazon will spend $21 billion on Prime Video and Music content by 2024, showing a 12% year-over-year growth. This growth rate is expected to accelerate as the NBA season approaches in Q4 2025.\nThis NBA deal represents Amazon's largest content agreement to date, surpassing the roughly $1 billion annually paid for their NFL deal, per Forbes.\nMaking Prime Video Profitable: Amazon aims to make Prime Video profitable as a standalone entity. BofA analysts identify three revenue streams that could help Amazon cover the NBA licensing costs:\nPrime Subscription Fees: Amazon has over 200 million global Prime subscribers. With the NBA's significant international appeal, Amazon could leverage this content to drive global Prime subscriptions and increase annual subscription fees. Advertising Revenue: Amazon is enhancing its advertising capabilities, and with superior targeting compared to traditional television, it should be able to generate significant ad revenues. Prime Shopping Activity: Prime members typically spend 2-3 times more than non-Prime shoppers. This deal could help reduce Prime churn during crucial holiday months, thereby boosting shopping gross profit.\nBofA maintains a \"Buy\" rating on Amazon, with a price objective of $220.00 per share, currently trading at $180.83 as of July 25, 2024. The firm believes that Amazon's consistent successes with its NFL deal make the new NBA partnership an attractive and strategic venture.\nRelated Articles\nBofA analyzes Amazon's 11-year deal to stream NBA games on Prime Video\nCalifornia Supreme Court upholds Prop 22: Effects on Uber, Lyft, DoorDash\nGoogle AI systems make headway with math in progress toward reasoning\n"

We\u2019ll hear from many different companies, a list that includes several cloud computing players such as Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN.\nBoth stocks have been sensitive to their cloud results, often dictating the post-earnings move. We already heard from another notable cloud player, Alphabet GOOGL, and the results provided some insight into what to expect from MSFT and AMZN. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nAlphabet\u2019s quarterly release was overall positive. The company enjoyed 31% EPS growth on nearly 14% higher sales. Both figures exceeded our consensus expectations, building on its recent streak of quarterly positivity.\nCloud showed great growth, with revenues of $10.3 billion nearly 30% higher year-over-year and reflecting a quarterly record. In addition, operating income from Google Cloud saw a sizable jump, reported at $900 million vs. $191 million in the year-ago period.\nOverall, the results were positive, but shares faced pressure following the release due to some uncertainty about AI CapEx. Alphabet has regularly exceeded our consensus cloud expectations as of late, as shown below.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCloud revenue growth of 23% year-over-year positively shocked investors in its latest release, showing stabilization after a few periods of slowing growth rates.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN.\nApple\u00a0shares hit a 52-week high of $220.38 on Jul 2 and finally closed at $220.27, up 14.4% year to date. Since Jun 10, when the iPhone maker hosted its annual developers\u2019 event, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple shares have jumped 14.1%, outperforming the Zacks Computer-Miniindustry\u2019s gain of 13.8% and the Zacks Computer & Technologysector\u2019s return of 5.8%.\nLately, AAPL shares have been gaining attention from investors thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, at WWDC.\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\nApple CEO Tim Cook has expressed his enthusiasm over the opportunities with Generative AI (GenAI). In the fiscal second-quarter earnings call, Cook stated that Apple enjoys a significant advantage in the AI space due to \u201cApple\u2019s unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple\u2019s silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy.\u201d\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple\u2019s stringent privacy standards.\nSiri, powered by Apple Intelligence, has become more natural, contextually aware, and capable of handling complex tasks. Users can communicate with Siri using both voice and text, and the assistant can now maintain context across multiple requests. Siri\u2019s new design features an elegant glowing light around the screen edge when active, and its functionality extends to providing device support and answering detailed questions about using the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\nIn a significant enhancement, Apple is integrating ChatGPT into its platforms, allowing users to access its expertise directly within iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia. Siri can utilize ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities, with user consent, to provide more detailed and accurate information. ChatGPT will also be available in the systemwide Writing Tools, enhancing content creation with advanced language models and image generation.\nApple\u2019s strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generating ability are noteworthy. As of Mar 30, 2024, cash & marketable securities were $162.34 billion compared with term debt of $102.59 billion.\nApple returned nearly $27 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 through dividend payouts ($3.7 billion) and share repurchases ($23.5 billion). Its board authorized an additional $110 billion for share repurchases and also raised dividend payout by 4% to 25 cents per share.\nChina\u2019s growth remains a worry for Apple due to stiff competition from local smartphone makers, including Huawei. The Chinese government\u2019s directive to state officials not to use non-Chinese phones for work has been detrimental to the iPhone\u2019s demand.\nPer Canalys data, the Mainland China smartphone market witnessed 67.7 million units of shipment in first-quarter 2024. Huawei led with a 17% market share, shipping 11.7 million smartphones, while Apple sold 10 million units, down 25% year over year, the most among the top five vendors.\nThe issues forced Apple to cut retail prices, which drove iPhone smartphone shipments in April (up 52% year over year) and is also expected to have benefited May sales. However, Apple is suffering from a lack of GenAI capabilities in the iPhone.\nApple\u2019s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter\u2019s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $83.75 billion, indicating 2.38% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings has increased by a penny to $1.33 per share over the past 30 days.\nMoreover, Apple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 30.63X compared with the Zacks Computer-Mini industry\u2019s 28.58X and higher than the median of 27.37X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\nHowever, Apple\u2019s AI push is hard to ignore.

        "Title": "Amazon\u2019s $20 billion NBA deal isn\u2019t riskless. But it\u2019s close",
        "Author": "  Jason Del Rey ",
        "Text": "The NBA is close to announcing its long-rumored TV rights deal with ESPN, NBC, and Amazon, The Athletic reported on Tuesday. The deal is expected to net the league $76 billion over 11 years, with the TV networks and online giant divvying up regular season and playoff games. There\u2019s an outside chance that TNT, an incumbent, could still push Amazon aside in the deal, the publication reported but, as currently constructed, Amazon is expected to be the NBA's new partner.\nFor the tech giant, the deal helps fill a hole in its already-giant advertising business, while serving as a nice addition for Prime members who are sports fans but who might occasionally dabble with the thought of dropping the service. The risks on the other hand, whether monetary or related to internal politics, appear relatively minimal for a company valued at $2 trillion. If you\u2019re Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, you probably do this deal 10 times out of 10, even at the steep cost of a reported $1.8 billion a year.\nDoes it matter that Jassy is a huge sports fan? It probably didn\u2019t hurt for those Prime Video leaders at the company who were pushing for the deal. But that\u2019s not why a deal like this gets done. The tech giant\u2019s advertising division is on pace for $50 billion in revenue this year but has largely reached those heights on the back of product ads \u2013 the product search results carrying \u201csponsored\u201d labels that have in recent years began dominating much of the shopping site for better or worse. Along with its Amazon\u2019s Thursday Night NFL games, the new NBA package (which would begin with the 2025-2026 NBA season) will help attract different big-brand advertisers to Amazon that typically wouldn\u2019t advertise with the online retailer because their product or service aren\u2019t widely sold on the platform. Think Anheuser-Busch for example.\nLive sporting events also serve as one of the last areas of appointment viewing, which drives big advertising spending. In addition to some Friday and Saturday regular season games, Amazon is also expected to air the NBA\u2019s new in-season tournament, which was a hit in its inaugural season last year, as well as some conference final playoff games and the so-called play-in games, which decide the last few teams that make the playoffs.\nBut the deal might be just as much about giving Prime customers another reason to stick around and not consider ditching the $139-a-year membership. According to a recent survey conducted by the equity research firm Evercore ISI, 90 million American households already have a Prime membership. In short, Prime has saturated much of the US market. Could the NBA package bring in some new Prime members, whether just for Prime Video or the broader service? Sure. But that likely isn\u2019t the overwhelming expectation internally.\nInstead, this is about getting Prime members to spend more time in the company\u2019s ecosystem because when that happens, they spend more money on Amazon. Another related reason: to give Prime members another reason not to think about dropping their membership. While the same Evercore survey found Amazon is still the online retailer that the greatest percentage of respondents believe has the best prices, selection and convenience, all three percentages were down between 4 and 10 percentage points from last year. Membership offerings from competitors like Walmart and new low-price competitors like Temu have caught the attention of US consumers, including Prime members.\nIn other words, to use a sports metaphor, this deal is more about playing defense with Prime membership numbers, not offense.\nAs a bonus, NBA games provide another big audience for Amazon to cross-promote Prime Video\u2019s original shows like Fallout or Reacher. You also can\u2019t count out merchandise tie-ins or new ways that the NBA might work with Amazon Web Services either.\nAre there risks? Sure.\nFor starters, it\u2019s no sure thing that the increased advertising in the games will make up for the $1.8 billion annual outlay for the rights (and that\u2019s not including production costs or the big-money contracts Amazon will offer top announcing talent to call the games). Amazon, however, also cares about the DWI , or down-stream impact, of increasing engagement with Prime members, who historically spend more on shopping the more they watch Prime Video.\nThe other thing to watch out for internally: If and how the multi-billion deal impacts the budget and ambitions of the company\u2019s studios business. Even at its $2 trillion market cap, Amazon divisions of course sets budgets and it\u2019s fair to wonder how nearly $2 billion earmarked for one part of the Prime Video business impacts investment allocations for the studio side of Prime Video.\nEven so, the upsides are too great to outweigh these risks. You might even call this deal a slam dunk.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Amazon will pay about $1.8 billion annually and make streaming an integral part of the league\u2019s media strategy. The new contracts start in the fall of next year.\n\u201cThroughout these negotiations, our primary objective has been to maximize the reach and accessibility of our games for our fans,\u201d the league said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cOur new arrangement with Amazon supports this goal by complementing the broadcast, cable and streaming packages that are already part of our new Disney and NBCUniversal arrangements.\u201d\nWarner Bros., parent of the TNT cable network and Max streaming service, said on July 22 that it was planning to match Amazon\u2019s offer, taking advantage of a clause in its current contract with the league that allows it to respond to competing bids.\n\u201cWarner Bros. Discovery\u2019s most recent proposal did not match the terms of Amazon Prime Video\u2019s offer and, therefore, we have entered into a long-term arrangement with Amazon,\u201d the league said.\nThe NBA\u2019s refusal sets up a potential legal battle with the media giant that has been its broadcast partner since Ronald Reagan was president.\n\u201cWe think they have grossly misinterpreted our contractual rights with respect to the 2025-\u201926 season and beyond, and we will take appropriate action,\u201d Warner Bros. said in an email.\nAmazon will show 66 regular-season NBA games on its Prime Video service. Comcast has the largest package with 100 games during the regular season, more than half of them for NBC. The new deal includes 80 regular season games for Disney, 20 of which will be on ABC, which remains the exclusive home of the finals.\nThe deal also include rights for the WNBA, with more than 125 games going to the three media giants, the women\u2019s league said. The WNBA expects to bring on additional media partners.\nThe value of the league\u2019s contract jumps to $200 million annually from the current $60 million, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information.\n\u201cPartnering with Disney, Amazon and NBCU marks a monumental chapter in WNBA history and clearly demonstrates the significant rise in value and the historic level of interest in women\u2019s basketball,\u201d WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said in a statement.\n(Updates with Warner comment in seventh paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship\nThe Miseducation of America\u2019s Nurse Practitioners\nJoe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy\u2019s New Kingmaker\nDisney Bets on Deadpool, Wolverine and Dirty Jokes to Save Marvel\nHow Sonny Angels and Smiskis Took Over TikTok\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "GE Healthcare and Amazon Web Services (AWS) are teaming up to build new generative AI models that can analyse complex medical data.\nGE HealthCare is partnering with the cloud computing company to develop models that help clinicians use data more efficiently for a range of healthcare operations, including screenings, diagnoses, decision support, and workflows such as scheduling.\nUS-headquartered GE HealthCare plans to utilise Amazon Bedrock, which provides access to foundation models for developing and deploying AI applications.\nBy leveraging Bedrock\u2019s access to foundation models, GE Healthcare intends to create advanced AI solutions that integrate comprehensive clinical and operational data. These applications will focus on reducing workload for physicians, personalising care, and enhancing operational efficiency, to benefit both healthcare providers and patients.\nGE Healthcare\u2019s portfolio includes a range of medical imaging systems, patient monitoring devices, and healthcare software. The medtech company already utilises AI to enhance diagnostics, optimise workflows, and personalise patient care.\n\u201cWith AWS, GE HealthCare plans to use the cloud to deliver more personalised, intelligent and efficient care,\u201d said AWS CEO Matt Garman.\n\u201cGE HealthCare is putting generative AI at the heart of their innovation, accelerated by the investments we have made in healthcare-specific cloud services and generative AI capabilities that provide best-in-class security, data privacy and access to the latest state-of-the-art foundation models.\u201d\nThis news comes after another deal earlier this month, where GE Healthcare partnered with Welsh company Intelligent Ultrasound Group to acquire the company\u2019s AI-driven ultrasound business outright for \u00a340.5m ($51m). As part of the deal, GE Healthcare will inherit Intelligent\u2019s ScanNav Assist AI technology software, which is designed to carry real-time image recognition, and already used across GE Healthcare\u2019s SonoLystlive and SonoLyst X/IR ultrasound systems, giving the company control over Intelligent Ultrasound\u2019s AI pipeline.\nAI continues to draw attention in the medtech sector. One of the leading companies making waves in the space is US-based technology giant NVIDIA, which has entered into a series of high-profile deals this year. In January 2024, it entered a collaboration with Amgen in January 2024 to build generative AI models.\nIn March 2024, GE HealthCare launched an ultrasound imaging software, SonoSAMTrack, which it developed in collaboration with NVIDIA.\nAI will become a key driver of medical device innovation, according to a report on GlobalData\u2019s Medical Intelligence Center.

        "Text": "Today\u2019s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks dives into the wave of selling that sent the Nasdaq tumbling to start the heart of big tech earnings season on Wednesday. The episode then explores Meta Platforms (META) and\u00a0Amazon (AMZN) stock before their upcoming earnings releases to see if investors should buy the top tech stocks before earnings or wait for more selling.\nTechnology stocks and other first-half standouts tanked on Wednesday, sending the Nasdaq below its 50-day moving average for only the second time in 2024.\u00a0\nThe selling came as the busy stretch of technology earnings kicked off after the closing bell on Tuesday, with Alphabet and Tesla.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTech stocks and the market could experience more selling and volatility throughout earnings season, especially since big tech set the bar very high.\nThankfully, the tailwinds that sent the stock market soaring in the first half remain in place. Any near-term selling represents a healthy recalibration and an opportunity for investors to buy their favorite stocks at discounts. \nThe two stocks we explore today are tech giants and AI investments.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMeta (META), the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, grew its daily active users by 7% in Q1 to 3.24 billion. Meta grew its ad impressions delivered across its family of apps by 20%. \nMeta stands to thrive in a world full of smartphone addicts. Meta is also investing heavily in its AI future. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s goal is for Meta to win the AI race by rolling out open source artificial intelligence.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta shares have soared roughly 400% off the market\u2019s 2022 lows to blow away Alphabet (GOOGL) and plenty of tech giants. The stock has also climbed 520% in the past 10 years vs. the Zacks Tech sector\u2019s 310%. \nThis context helps Meta\u2019s valuation look all the more impressive, with Meta trading at a 63% discount to its highs and 20% below the Zacks Tech sector at 22.4X forward 12-month earnings.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta stock has fallen 14% from its early July highs heading into its quarterly earnings release. Meta stock is trading below its 50-day and 21-week moving averages. Meta trades at roughly neutral RSI levels on a 10-year timeframe after hitting its most overbought levels of the last decade earlier this year.\nMeta\u2019s recent cooldown makes the stock a potentially more appealing long-term buy-and-hold candidate for investors who can weather near-term volatility. It is worth remembering that Meta has a robust balance sheet and began paying a dividend earlier this year as it focuses on efficiency and profits.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAmazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy took over roughly three years ago with a mission to boost the bottom line while honing in on expansion in key growth areas. \nAmazon remains the king of e-commerce and its advertising unit is booming. AMZN also runs the world\u2019s largest cloud-computing business, topping rivals Microsoft and Alphabet, helping it thrive throughout the AI supercycle.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon is also diving headfirst into its AI efforts, with plans to devote more capex on its cloud computing and AI infrastructure than e-commerce going forward. \nAmazon\u2019s steady cloud computing and AI growth, coupled with its focus on boosting earnings is a winning pitch to Wall Street. Amazon\u2019s earnings outlook has soared over the last year for FY24 and FY25 to help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nAmazon stock has skyrocketed 1,000% in the last 10 years vs. Tech\u2019s 300%, Apple\u2019s 800%, and Alphabet\u2019s 480%. Yet Amazon stock is down around 1% in the last three years compared to Tech\u2019s 25% run. \nAMZN failed to break out meaningfully above its 2021 highs. Amazon is currently trading 10% below its highs and 22% below its average Zacks price target.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon trades around its 21-week moving average and near neutral RSI levels on a 10-year timeframe. On the valuation front, Amazon trades 95% below its highs and at a 50% discount to its 10-year median at 35.1X forward 12-month earnings. \nOn top of that, Amazon trades near its lowest forward earnings multiple since the 2008 financial crisis.\u00a0\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Alice Barlow ",
        "Text": "You\u2019ve seen the Mighty Patch before.\nThe tiny, translucent disks are increasingly adorning the faces of Gen Z and millennials when a pimple appears, and over 1 billion of the brand\u2019s signature hydrocolloid patches have sold thus far. Manufacturer Hero Cosmetics also recently netted a partnership with content creator Alix Earle.\nFounder and CEO Ju Rhyu told Fortune she came up with the idea for the brand while living as an expat in South Korea while working for Samsung in 2012. At the time, only two types of hydrocolloid patches existed in K-Beauty: medical and cosmetic-oriented. The entrepreneur wanted to bridge the gap and bring pimple patches to the U.S., seeing an opportunity in the $3.9 billion K-Beauty industry.\nSo in 2017, when she was 37 years old, Rhyu launched her brand along with cofounders Dwight Lee and Andrew Lee, capitalizing on their corporate expertise and a cool $50,000 the trio had pooled together.\nAfter agreeing that Mighty Patch needed to be cash flow positive and profitable, the trio set out to find a manufacturer. Rhyu compiled a list of potential business partners, and told the Female Startup Club she found the companies from the boxes of acne patches at a local pharmacy.\nOf the 10 manufacturers Rhyu contacted through cold emails, only two responded. She said the final match was \u201cluck,\u201d and Hero Cosmetics still works with it today who. Rhyu says the manufacturer makes \u201cthe best quality patch in Korea.\u201d\nArmed with a business partner and a mission to disrupt the Band-Aid aisle, Hero earned its first 10,000-unit order.\nIn 2017, Hero began selling the Mighty Patch, including on e-commerce giant Amazon. But the company initially couldn\u2019t get the product featured on Amazon Prime, which can increase orders by 25% as members get free shipping and other perks.\nA breakthrough came after some trial and error.\n\"The pricing actually was kind of an accident, because we were selling on Amazon,\u201d Rhyu said. \u201cThere were already some players that were a lot cheaper at around $5. And actually wanted to place our products at $9.99. But the funny story is we couldn't get Amazon Prime. And we were sort of playing around with different things to see how we can unlock Prime. And one of the ways was we increased our price [to] $12.99.\"\nRhyu chose to stick with the newer price tag after selling out in just 90 days. And in 2022, she shepherded a $630 million acquisition with Church & Dwight.\nPimple patches may have only recently become a beauty staple for Americans, but they\u2019ve existed in South Korea since the early 2010\u2019s.\nWhen Hero Cosmetics first entered the market in the U.S., Rhyu said there were only a few competitors on Amazon. Now, the beauty industry is flooded with all types of pimple patches. Brands like Starface have introduced bright colors and cloud and star shapes to the beauty aisle, while Neutrogena and CosRX have created their own translucent hydrocolloid disks.\nBut Rhyu says Hero\u2019s decision to keep patches discreet allows them to reach a broader range of customers.\nRhyu also credits Hero\u2019s success to their special formula, \u201cWhen they use ours versus competition, I think they can tell the product difference.\u201d She adds that Hero's expertise in the acne patch category created a lot of trust and is part of the reason why they stay number one to this day.\n\u201cWe want to be very inclusive and accommodate everyone from the 14-year-old to people in their 50s,\u201d she says, adding that bright shapes and colors may be fun for younger generations, \u201cbut it won't work for everybody.\u201d\nRhyu says her success isn\u2019t determined by her company's revenue, but by changing the narrative around acne.\nShe credits social media as a key factor in Hero Cosmetics\u2019 popularity, emphasizing the virality of \u201cthe peel off\u201d when content creators remove their Mighty Patch and reveal the \u201cgunk\u201d underneath.\n\u201cThat type of content goes viral a lot and that virality helps with education,\u201d she says. \u201cSocial media, obviously, has been so crucial to the success of our business.\u201d\nShe says she feels \u201cproud\u201d when customers wear the product in public since Hero aims to make acne \u201cmore acceptable.\u201d\n\u201cI love seeing people wear them to the office or just out and about,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat it means to me is we've done our job, that we've really sort of broken down the taboo aspect of acne and made it okay.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "A number of companies' stocks achieved new all-time highs on Friday, July 5, including tech behemoths Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft, and Meta Platforms. As a result, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose 1% and 2%, respectively, during a 24-hour period.\nThe rally followed news that unemployment had hit its highest level since 2021. Wall Street expects an uptick in unemployment to bring down interest rates, which often promotes growth in the stock market as companies benefit from lower borrowing costs. As a result, now could be an excellent time to expand your position in \"Big Tech\" before it's too late.\nAmazon and Apple are two attractive options, profiting from immense brand loyalty from their customers and the cash to expand into budding sectors like artificial intelligence (AI). Let's examine these consumer-favorite companies and determine whether Amazon or Apple is the better stock to buy this month.\nShares in Amazon have climbed 53% during the past 12 months, rallying due to several quarters of impressive earnings growth and expansion into some of tech's fastest-growing industries. One of the most attractive aspects of its business is its diversification.\nThe company has come a long way since starting as an online book retailer 30 years ago. It's vastly expanded its product range to become the biggest name in e-commerce and achieved lucrative positions in cloud computing, video streaming, digital advertising, and now, AI.\nAmazon has growth catalysts across tech, potentially making it one of the most reliable long-term investments. For instance, an economic downturn in 2022 hit the company hard, causing steep profit declines in its retail segments.\nHowever, Amazon remained profitable during the challenging year, thanks to its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Meanwhile, the company has since pulled off an impressive turnaround in its retail business, proving its ability to navigate market headwinds successfully.\nIn the 2024 first quarter, Amazon's revenue rose 13% year over year to $143 billion. Its North American and international divisions posted revenue gains of 12% and 10%, respectively, with AWS sales spiking 17%. Also, Amazon's operating income more than tripled, hitting over $15 billion.\nAmazon is on a promising growth trajectory as sales continue to rise and it keeps investing in its business. This makes its stock a compelling option right now.\nApple's stock hit a record high this week following a rally. Its share price has increased by 17% since its Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) on June 10.\nDeclines in product sales and a delayed start in AI have concerned investors during the past year. This was reflected in a stock that has risen slower this year than many of its peers (as seen in the chart above). However, the WWDC gave a peek into Apple's plan to boost product sales and carve out a lucrative role in AI over the long term.\nAt the June conference, Apple unveiled a new AI platform it calls Apple Intelligence, which will bring generative features across its product lineup. However, consumers must upgrade to the company's newer devices to access Apple Intelligence.\niPhone users will need a 15 Pro or higher. Meanwhile, only Macs and iPads using Apple's custom-developed Apple Silicon chips can run the new AI tools. The company hopes the new features will compel shoppers to upgrade their devices to access the coming features.\nApple revealed in its Q1 2024 earnings report it had more than 2 billion active devices worldwide. The company's reach in the consumer market is vast, and its deep economic moat is driven by a walled garden of products and a reputation for quality. Apple generated $102 billion in free cash flow\u00a0(what's left of cash flow after capital expenditures), so I wouldn't bet against the company flourishing over the long term.\nAmazon and Apple have become worldwide household names. Both companies can seemingly do no wrong, succeeding in nearly every new market they enter. However, Amazon's quick recovery after macroeconomic headwinds in 2022 and arguably more diverse business model make its stock potentially more reliable and worth considering over Apple.\nThis chart shows that Amazon's financial growth has dwarfed Apple's during the past year. The retail giant is enjoying gains in all parts of its business. Meanwhile, many questions remain about whether Apple's AI expansion will, in fact, boost earnings.\nIn addition to Amazon's price-to-sales ratio of 3.5, compared to Apple's 9.3, the e-commerce company's stock is the better no-brainer buy this year.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

Jefferies analysts are projecting growth of at least a further 18%.\nAds on Prime Video alone could generate nearly $3 billion in fiscal 2024, their first year of existence, the analysts wrote.\n\nThe growth of two of Amazon's (AMZN) divisions could drive revenue, profit margin, and the company's stock price higher as it expands beyond its dominant position in e-commerce, Jefferies analysts wrote.\nThe company's bets on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and advertising should provide higher-margin revenue streams as they grow and the company shifts to making its retail operations more profitable, the analysts wrote in a Monday note. They maintained a \"buy\" rating on the shares, raising their price target to $235 from $225.\nThe $235 price target would represent an increase of about 18% from Amazon's share price late Tuesday at just under $200. Jefferies analysts said they see a bull case for shares to rise over 40%, to $285, if AWS and advertising revenue grows faster than expected. Amazon shares have risen over 30% so far this year after closing 2023 at $151.94.\n\"The two highest operating margin businesses are taking the front stage, driving improving profitability and EV [enterprise value] for the whole company,\" the analysts wrote.\nAWS lately has been a strong source of growth for Amazon, with revenue in the segment growing 17% year-over-year to $25 billion in the company's most recently completed quarter. CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a letter to shareholders earlier this year that the company sees growth potential in all of its businesses, and said on April's earnings call that AWS has grown as the cloud storage industry continues to grow, along with its connections to the world of generative AI.\nAds first came to Amazon Prime Video earlier this year. The Jefferies analysts said that ad business could drive nearly $3 billion in new sales for Amazon in fiscal 2024, along with hundreds of millions of dollars from consumers who pay extra to avoid seeing the ads.\nRead the original article on Investopedia.\n"

        "Author": "  Martin Coulter ",
        "Text": "By Martin Coulter\nLONDON (Reuters) - A British union has filed a legal challenge against Amazon, accusing the U.S. ecommerce giant of inappropriately influencing warehouse workers to vote against unionisation.\nOn Wednesday, warehouse staff in Coventry, central England, rejected a vote to become the first site outside the U.S. to force Amazon to negotiate labour terms. The GMB union narrowly lost the ballot, with 49.5% of the 2,600 workers who voted polling in favour, versus 50.5% against.\nIn a complaint to Britain's labour law regulator submitted on Wednesday, and seen by Reuters, the GMB union said Amazon had inappropriately quizzed workers on whether they were pro-unionisation, and placed posters around the site with QR codes which workers could use to cancel their union membership.\nIf the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC), an independent body that adjudicates on collective bargaining rights, accepts GMB's complaint, the body could order a fresh unionisation vote take place at the Coventry site.\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the company did not believe there was any legal merit in the GMB's complaint about the ballot process.\nThey said: \"The recognition ballot was conducted by an independent third-party organisation appointed by the CAC. Their report contains no suggestion of any irregularities or unfairness. We are confident that a fair ballot process has been followed.\"\nIn a photograph filed with the complaint, a screen displays a QR code with the caption: \u201cWhy pay while you wait for a ballot? You can cancel your GMB membership anytime by scanning the QR code with your phone camera.\u201d\nGMB said in its complaint that another 15 votes in favour would have resulted in victory, but its records indicated over 70 membership cancellation requests were received via the QR code.\nThe complaint is separate to an earlier legal action filed in April, an employment tribunal as part of which Amazon workers are seeking compensation, claiming they were inappropriately influenced to cancel their union memberships.\nRosa Curling, director at nonprofit Foxglove, which has been supporting the GMB union's organising effort at the warehouse, said: \"This was a stitch-up, plain and simple.\"\nShe added: \"We believe these tactics are unlawful and unfair, and call upon the CAC to uphold this complaint.\"\nA spokesperson for the CAC declined to comment.

        "Title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN): Eminence Capital\u2019s Ricky Sandler is Bullish on This Stock Right Now",
        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Eminence Capital's Ricky Sandler.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other stocks.\nInvesting prowess runs in Ricky Sandler's family. The manager of prominent hedge fund Eminence Capital had a 13F portfolio worth more than $7 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2024. His father was a research analyst at Goldman Sachs, one of the premier investment banks in the world, and later went on to manage a hedge fund. Sandler has had a somewhat similar career trajectory, beginning as a research associate for Mark Asset Management before making his name as a hedge fund manager at Fusion Capital Management. In 1999, Sandler founded Eminence Capital, growing the small fund into a multi-billion dollar investment firm over the course of two decades. The fund focuses on uncovering value in the market through fundamental research, an art that seems to be dying on Wall Street as fast money schemes become more popular.\nThe investing philosophy of Sandler has been influenced by his work at Mark Asset Management and Fusion Capital Management. At the former, Sandler learned the importance of focusing on a bottom-up research strategy aimed at picking great businesses. At the latter, Sandler learned that investing in good businesses was not enough. In order to create wealth, money managers had a duty to invest in great businesses at value prices, thereby creating room for future growth. Sandler calls this the \u201cquality value\u201d approach to investing. He made these comments in an appearance on the Equity Mates podcast last year. Sandler, in remarks made during the podcast, stressed that investors should not only buy at good prices but should also not stay invested in equities when they become too expensive. Young investors would do well to pick up on this simple yet effective tip.\nAt Eminence Capital, Sandler has developed a long-short equity strategy that has paid huge dividends for clients. Per the hedge fund manager, the Asian debt crisis in the late 1990s was one of the formative events in his life that led him to understand the value of an effective shorting strategy. During the crisis, the International Monetary Fund had to pump in more than $40 billion into large economies in East Asia to contain the spread of the meltdown to the world economy. The company Sandler was a part of at the time owned stakes in many mid-cap Asian firms that were hit particularly hard by the crisis, leading to huge losses for his fund. Sandler now makes sure that his stock pickers spend at least half of their time developing individual stock shorts, a strategy that aims to build up the defenses of his fund should the market take a turn for the worst.\nSandler believes that in the present economic environment, only investors that have valuation discipline and short selling skills will be able to keep pace with the changing dynamics of the stock market. However, he also underlines that long bets remain equally important. The New York-based manager outlines his long investing philosophy as owning mispriced stocks that have the potential to take a turn for the better in the coming two or three years. Sandler emphasizes the importance of investing in ownable companies \u2014 businesses that he describes are well-positioned competitively, sound structurally with trusted management teams, and able to generate solid cash flows. Sandler urges money managers to invest only in firms that they would be comfortable investing in for their family portfolio. A look at the top picks in his latest 13F portfolio illustrates this strategy in action.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we scanned the stock portfolio of Eminence Capital according to the 13F filings submitted at the end of the first quarter of 2024. We selected the top 10 stocks from this portfolio. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\u00a0\nEminence Capital\u2019s Stake: $229,623,740\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a diversified technology firm with core interests in ecommerce. The value proposition of the stock can be understood by looking at a few key financial metrics and strategic moves made public by the firm over the past few months. Over the last twelve months, the company has generated earnings per share of $3.57. This value is expected to grow by 23% in the coming year, from $4.72 to $5.80 per share\u200b. This gives the stock plenty of room for growth and seems consistent with the Sandler strategy of buying good companies at value prices.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is investing heavily in expanding AWS infrastructure and capabilities, with plans to launch new regions and data centers, indicating long-term growth prospects and a commitment to maintaining a competitive edge\u200b. The ongoing innovation in AI and cloud services, exemplified by new AWS capabilities and customer adoption, positions the firm favorably in rapidly growing tech sectors\u200b\nIn a recent investor letter, Lakehouse Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) delivered an impressive quarterly result that also came in well ahead of analyst expectations. Net sales increased 13% year-on-year to $143.3 billion and operating profits increased 219% year-on-year to $15.3 billion (vs the high end of guidance at $12.0 billion). As has been the case for several quarters now, the highlight of the result was the significant improvement in profitability metrics, as management continues to drive cost efficiencies across its retail operations and Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon delivered to Prime members at its fastest speeds ever. In March, across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, nearly 60% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day, and in London, Tokyo, and Toronto, 3 out of 4 items were delivered the same or next day. Bigger picture, we continue to believe that the market underestimates the length of the runway ahead in the core retail business (note that e-commerce sales in the U.S. still only make up 15% of total retail sales) and that there is still significant margin expansion ahead as scale and efficiency benefits continue to come through.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks to buy according to Eminence Capital's Ricky Sandler. You can visit 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Eminence Capital's Ricky Sandler\u00a0to see the other stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  GlobalData ",
        "Text": "E-commerce major Amazon has been asked by UK regulator the Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA) to improve its treatment of suppliers.\nThe GCA has expressed concerns following a survey in which under half of Amazon's direct suppliers believed that the company consistently followed the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP).\nThe code seeks to ensure that major UK grocery retailers, including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s and Marks & Spencer, treat suppliers fairly.\nThe GCA's 2024 annual survey indicated that only 47% of Amazon's direct suppliers perceived the company as consistently complying with the code, a notable decline from the previous year's 59%.\nThe 11th annual survey received 3,000 responses and revealed a slight decrease in suppliers experiencing code issues, down from 36% to 33%.\nThe average compliance score across the 14 largest UK grocery retailers was 91%, excluding Amazon. With Amazon included, the average was 94%, indicating that its performance significantly lagged behind its peers.\nAmazon, which became subject to the GSCOP in 2022, has been urged to take \"swift and comprehensive action\" to demonstrate compliance.\nThe GCA is currently assessing the effectiveness of changes implemented by Amazon and their impact on suppliers.\nGroceries code adjudicator Mark White said: \u201cI am encouraged to see improvements in retailers\u2019 treatment of suppliers across a range of issues including the management of cost price increase requests, but also resolution of invoice discrepancies and data input errors.\n\u201cHowever, the survey shows clearly that many suppliers do not believe that Amazon is complying with the Code. Amazon must ensure suppliers understand the changes it has made since its designation and in response to these survey results, and make any further changes that are needed to ensure code compliance.\n\u201cI will not hesitate to launch a formal investigation if appropriate and necessary to ensure Amazon is treating its suppliers fairly and lawfully.\n\u201cI encourage suppliers to continue to confidentially tell me about the issues they are facing with Amazon.\u201d\n\"UK regulator asks Amazon to take swift action on supplier treatment \" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Title": "Amazon Stock Is Up 27% This Year. Where Will It Be by the End of 2024?",
        "Author": "  Jennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is beating the market, up 27% as we enter the second half of the year. Investors are enthusiastic about its prospects in artificial intelligence (AI), but that's only the tip of the Amazon iceberg. Where might Amazon be by the end of the year?\nAmazon had an excellent first-quarter report and many updates about new AI launches. Sales increased 13% year over year in Q1, and operating income more than tripled to $15.3 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) of $0.98 flew past Wall Street's expectations.\nAmazon is investing in AI in all sorts of ways. It committed $230 million to invest in an accelerator for AI-based start-ups, awarding $1 million to the top 80 applicants \"that are using generative AI to solve complex challenges.\" Last week, it announced an investment in EvolutionaryScale, an evolutionary biology firm that's using generative AI and machine learning to create transformative pharmaceutical products. Those are just two of the ways it's positioning itself to benefit from real changes using generative AI.\nOther updates were the addition of new, popular brands to the e-commerce platform and new spring sale events. In the 60 largest U.S. metro areas, 60% of orders were delivered within 48 hours, and in several global large cities like Tokyo and London, 75% of orders were delivered the same or next day.\nAmazon continues its strides in advertising, which once again was its fastest-growing category. Sales were up 24% year over year. Sponsored products were the main driver, which makes a lot of sense. Amazon is leveraging its unmatched shopping platform to make money from ads, and it also makes money when the ads lead to product sales. Amazon can offer incredible data for advertisers based on its decades of machine learning, creating opportunities for pinpoint accuracy and success.\nAmazon is continuing down the generative AI road, and I wouldn't be surprised if it makes some major announcements over the next few months. It will almost definitely expand its AI services for Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers and improve its AI capabilities for e-commerce and advertising. It's already pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into creating the next level of AI technology, and there are likely to be ongoing results.\nIt will probably be making more deliveries faster to more people and signing new high-profile clients for AWS. Amazon is already back on the upswing despite stubborn high inflation, and if inflation does begin to ease, performance could improve even more.\nManagement is guiding for 7% to 11% sales growth in Q2 and operating income to increase from $7.7 billion to about $12 billion. It didn't provide full-year guidance, and it will report Q2 results with a Q3 outlook in late July or August.\nThe average Wall Street consensus for 2024 EPS is $4.55, which represents a 57% increase year over year. Amazon has frequently beaten Wall Street's expectations, and if it comes through this year, it will drive another jump in Amazon stock.\nBy the end of 2024, expect Amazon to be bigger and better, with more of a focus on AI.\nAmazon stock still offers incredible opportunities for investors. In some ways, it looks like it's just getting started, or at least entering a new chapter that could lead to important changes in its business. But you don't need to bet on AI to feel confident in Amazon's future. There's so much else Amazon is doing right. Keep in mind that buying Amazon stock includes investing in AI, but the difference between Amazon and many other AI companies is that even on the small chance it doesn't work in its favor, Amazon will just get up and move onto the next thing. It's had failures in the past, but it keeps going. With Amazon's tremendous assets, strong lead in several businesses, and ongoing growth drivers, there's plenty to be excited about.\nThat's how Wall Street sees it, too. An estimated 95% of 65 covering analysts call it a buy, with an average target price 13% higher than today and a high of 86% over the next 12 to 18 months.\nIt's important to remember that there are no guarantees, and investing in the future is always an unknown. That's another reason Amazon is a compelling buy -- Amazon has an excellent track record, which makes it low risk. Most investors can find a place for Amazon in their portfolio, and it should keep climbing for the rest of 2024.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Overall Smaller Discounts Seen on Essentials with Bigger Discounts on Higher Value Categories\nNEW YORK, July 19, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Prime Day discounts indicate a need for retailers to prepare for cautious consumers for the coming Holiday season, according to a new report by Impact Analytics\u2122, the pioneer in AI-powered planning and pricing solutions for the retail, grocery, manufacturing, and CPG industries. The data shows low discounts, of less than 10% on average, in essential categories including Grocery & Gourmet Food; Pet Supplies; Appliances; Baby Products; and Patio, Lawn & Garden. Non-essential and High-Value Categories had significant discounts on Prime Day as well as the highest increase in discounts leading up to prime day. These categories include Electronics; Cell Phones & Accessories; Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry; Tools & Home Improvement; and Sports & Outdoors.\n\u201cGiven the current macro-economic conditions, Prime Day appeared to strike a delicate balance between maintaining margins and stimulating demand,\u201d said Prashant Agrawal, CEO of Impact Analytics. \u201cOur data shows a high concentration of lower discounts on everyday essentials, indicating that pricing might not have a strong impact on buyer behavior for these items, which may reflect ongoing inflationary pressures and stable demand in these segments. Retailers must start preparing now to navigate these conditions effectively not only to serve a cautious consumer this holiday but also to ensure they are ready to weather future market dynamics and uncertainty.\u201d\nSignificantly, 81% of last month\u2019s best selling items in Grocery & Gourmet Food were not included in the Prime Day Sale. On the opposite end of the spectrum, only 41% of bestselling Electronics, 45% of Cell Phones & Accessories, and 50% of Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry were not marked down.\nThe report also shows that Prime Day 2024 had deeper promotions compared to previous years\u2019 events across most categories. The top categories with the steepest increase in promotions compared to Prime Day 2023 include Appliances +8% (24% vs 16%); Cell Phones & Accessories +6% (28% vs 22%); Electronics +4% (34% vs 30%). The categories with the steepest decrease in promotions include Beauty and Personal Care -5% (29% vs 34%); and Grocery & Gourmet Food -1% (23% vs 25%).\nComparing 2024\u2019s Amazon Prime Day with Walmart Deals, the discounts offered by both events were similar for categories including Appliances; Electronics; Grocery & Gourmet Food; and Sports & Outdoor. Walmart Deals offered significantly deeper discounts in the Home & Kitchen category at 36% compared to Amazon Prime\u2019s 27%.\nRead the full report here.\nABOUT IMPACT ANALYTICSImpact Analytics offers a holistic suite of AI powered solutions to help brands future-proof their businesses using predictive analytics.

        "Author": "  Ethan Howland ",
        "Text": "This story was originally published on Utility Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Utility Dive newsletter.\nExelon\u2019s Commonwealth Edison utility subsidiary stands to add up to $5 billion to its rate base by building transmission infrastructure to serve planned data centers in Illinois, according to Constellation Energy.\nThat potential rate base growth explains why Exelon and American Electric Power are challenging a proposed amended interconnection service agreement, or ISA, for an Amazon data center to be co-located at Talen Energy\u2019s majority-owned Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, the independent power producer said in a filing at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday.\n\u201cProtestors are here to protect their ability to monopolize data center interconnection by limiting non-wires (i.e., colocation) alternatives for customers and ensuring that the utilities can grow their rate base,\u201d Constellation said.\nAEP and Exelon \u2014 on behalf of their utilities \u2014 challenged the ISA, in part because they claim it could cause an annual shift of up to $140 million in transmission costs onto PJM ratepayers. AEP and Exelon said FERC should start a hearing process to consider the issue, or reject the amended ISA outright.\nThe Organization of PJM States, which represents state utility regulators, last week urged FERC to start a hearing process because \u201cquestions of fact and law remain unresolved\u201d about the amended ISA. Also, earlier this month, PJM\u2019s market monitor said FERC should reject or start a hearing process on the amended ISA.\nPPL told FERC\u00a0that PJM\u2019s independent market monitor,\u00a0AEP and Exelon raise \u201cimportant issues,\u201d but they relate to general policies and should be considered outside the ISA docket. \u201cJoint protesters and the IMM supply no grounds to reject the revised ISA, which greatly enhances the reliability of the PJM transmission system compared to the current version \u2026 of the same ISA,\u201d PPL said in a July 12 filing.\u00a0\nBased on information gleaned from a regulatory proceeding involving ComEd at the Illinois Commerce Commission, it appears that nearly all the costs of power line facilities built to support data centers in Illinois are paid for by all ratepayers, according to Constellation.\nSince 2017, ComEd has interconnected 12 data centers totaling nearly 120 MW, according to Constellation. The Chicago-based utility has about 25 data centers in some phase of engineering or construction with a peak demand of about 5,000 MW, the IPP said.\nExtrapolating from the existing data centers, the new ones could add about $5 billion to ComEd\u2019s rate base, with customers paying about $4.5 billion of that amount, Constellation said.\n\u201cViewed through the lens of rate base growth opportunity, the unusual intervention of Exelon and AEP in the filing of an amended interconnection agreement agreed to by the host utility, the generator, and the independent grid operator makes more sense,\u201d Constellation said. \u201cEntities that socialize 90% or more of those costs to their other customers should not be able to derail this proceeding \u2013 and denigrate co-location configurations \u2013 in the name of consumer protection.\u201d\nIf FERC has concerns about co-locating large loads, they should be addressed in a stakeholder process, not as part of the ISA decision, Constellation said.\nConstellation owns eight nuclear power plants in PJM totaling nearly 16 GW \u2014 or about half the nuclear capacity in the grid operator\u2019s footprint, which covers all or part of 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states and the District of Columbia.\nFERC is slated to take action on the ISA proposal by an Aug. 3 deadline.\nExelon and AEP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Amazon (AMZN), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.\nThis online retailer has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 30.42%.\nFor the most recent quarter, Amazon was expected to post earnings of $0.83 per share, but it reported $1.13 per share instead, representing a surprise of 36.14%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.81 per share, while it actually produced $1.01 per share, a surprise of 24.69%.\nPrice and EPS Surprise\nFor Amazon, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nAmazon currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.58%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on August 1, 2024.\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Amazon (AMZN) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Amazon (AMZN).\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.07, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.07 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 46 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 43 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 93.5% and 6.5% of all recommendations.\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AMZN\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Amazon, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\nIs AMZN a Good Investment?\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.2% over the past month to $4.59.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Amazon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Amazon may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "By Deborah Mary Sophia\n(Reuters) -Amazon.com is responsible for the sale of hazardous third-party products on its platform, a U.S. government agency said, ordering the e-commerce giant to propose steps to inform consumers and encourage them to return or destroy the products.\nThe directive from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) covers more than 400,000 products, including faulty carbon monoxide detectors, hairdryers without electrocution protection and children's sleepwear that violated flammability standards.\n\"Amazon failed to notify the public about these hazardous products and did not take adequate steps to encourage its customers to return or destroy them, thereby leaving consumers at substantial risk of injury,\" the agency said on Tuesday.\nIt called Amazon a \"distributor\" of defective products listed on its website as it is stored and dispatched by the company.\nAmazon said it would appeal against the order and present its case in court.\nSeparately, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it had last week issued a warning letter to Amazon over its distribution of potent chemical peel drug products that violated the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\nIt said such products pose a public health risk as they can cause skin injuries such as burns, wounds, swelling and scarring.\nThe health agency issued a similar notice to big-box retailer Walmart. The retailer did not respond to a request for comment, while Amazon did not comment on the issue.\nThe CPSC had sued Amazon in July 2021, forcing the company to recall hundreds of thousands of hazardous products sold on its platform.\nIn response, Amazon had removed a \"vast majority\" of such products from its store and refunded customers, but said it only provides logistics services to independent merchants and is not a distributor.\nLate last year, the agency warned consumers to stop using toy magnets from Chinese seller Doraemon, which were being sold on Amazon.com, following seven deaths from ingestion.\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia and Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Vijay Kishore and Arun Koyyur)\n"

        "Title": "Forget Amazon: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) hit an all-time high this week after rising 53% over the last 12 months. The company has rallied Wall Street with multiple quarters of stellar financial growth and an expanding role in artificial intelligence (AI).\nAmazon Web Services' (AWS) dominance in the cloud industry grants the company a promising position in AI, as more and more businesses turn to such platforms for their AI needs. Meanwhile, the company has announced a venture into chip design. Amazon has an exciting outlook in AI and would likely make an asset to any portfolio over the long term. However, its stock growth over the last year hasn't exactly matched its earnings growth, meaning its shares are slightly overpriced for now.\nThis table shows Amazon has the highest price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow ratios out of some of the most prominent names in AI software. The figures suggest Amazon is currently one of the worst-valued stocks among its peers.\nHowever, two companies stand out as bargain buys in the space, indicating they could be worth considering over Amazon: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). These tech giants are investing heavily in AI and could see significant gains as the industry develops.\nSo, forget Amazon and consider buying these two artificial intelligence stocks now.\nAlphabet is a no-brainer at its current price point. The company has delivered significant earnings and stock growth over the last year, yet is trading at a bargain price compared to its peers. Meanwhile, Alphabet has the brand power, tech, and cash reserves to go far in AI.\nThe company's Google Cloud platform holds an 11% market share in cloud computing, compared to AWS' 31%. It's the third-largest cloud company after Amazon and Microsoft. However, it's outpacing both in growth.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Google Cloud revenue jumped 28% year over year. Comparatively, the same period saw AWS sales rise by 17% and Microsoft Azure's revenue increase by 21%.\nAlphabet is investing billions in AI and is in a solid position to build a lucrative AI ecosystem around its products. As the home of potent brands like Android, YouTube, and the many services under Google, Alphabet has countless opportunities to boost its business with AI. The company has the potential to offer more efficient digital advertising, add generative features to its smartphone operating system, better track viewing trends on YouTube, and create a Google Search experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nMoreover, this chart shows Alphabet is a thoroughly reliable stock. Over the last five years, it has beaten Amazon in stock and free cash flow growth. Meanwhile, it has delivered a similar rise in operating income. In addition to its far better-valued share price, Alphabet is a screaming buy right now and a better AI stock than Amazon.\nApple's stock has risen 14% since Jan. 1. The figure is considerably lower than its peers, with Amazon's and Alphabet's stocks rising more than 30% during that time. Apple missed out on the initial boom in AI, preferring to take a more gradual approach to the market. However, recent developments suggest it could come back strong in the coming years.\nBloomberg reported on Jul. 2 that Apple is poised to get an observer role on ChatGPT developer OpenAI's board. The move follows an announcement at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference in June that revealed its smart assistant Siri will receive a major AI overhaul, making it more intuitive and able to answer hundreds of new questions. Siri will now pass off certain questions to ChatGPT as part of the update, making the OpenAI platform available to users through its iPhones, iPads, or Macs.\nAccording to Bloomberg, \"The board observer role will put Apple on par with Microsoft Corp., OpenAI's biggest backer, and its main AI technology provider.\" Apple has been in steep competition with Microsoft for years, with both leaders in consumer tech and responsible for the two most used computer operating systems. As a result, Apple's seat at OpenAI's table could bring its AI technology more in line with its rival and boost its entire position in the industry.\nThis table shows that Apple is potentially better financially equipped than Amazon or Microsoft to expand in AI. The company is a cash cow, with far more free cash flow and operating income over the last five years. So, despite its slower approach to AI, I wouldn't be against it carving out a lucrative position in the sector over the long term.\nAlongside its better-valued stock price, Apple is worth considering over Amazon stock this July.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Deborah Mary Sophia ",
        "Text": "By Deborah Mary Sophia\n(Reuters) -Amazon.com is expected to join Google and Microsoft on Thursday in reporting a surge in capital spending on artificial intelligence as Big Tech companies rush to capitalize on the booming technology.\nThe e-commerce giant's capital investments - mostly for building cloud and generative AI infrastructure - is expected to have risen 43% in the second quarter to $16.41 billion, according to LSEG data. That represents a roughly $1.5 billion increase from the previous three months.\nThe steep spending is also expected to pressure Amazon's margins, outweighing benefits from cost cuts and supply chain efficiencies that are aiding the retail unit's profitability.\nThe company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has long dominated the cloud-computing market but it has been facing tough competition from Microsoft in recent quarters after the Windows maker rolled out AI-powered services to its Azure cloud business.\nIn response, Amazon has partnered with the likes of Anthropic and offered startups free credits that cover the cost of using major AI models to boost the market share of its AI platform Bedrock. It also named a new head for the AWS unit in May.\nMicrosoft and Google-parent Alphabet also said earlier this month they would plow ahead with investments even as the payoff from AI takes longer than some investors had hoped. This knocked Big Tech stocks whose valuations have soared this year on the promise of AI.\n\"Amazon's capex spend will certainly be scrutinized closely. It has been slow on the adoption of AI and is skewed towards smaller companies which have struggled in the high interest-rate environment,\" said Ben Barringer, analyst at Quilter Cheviot.\n\"We would expect AWS to start speeding things up in its AI development going forward.\"\nAmazon shares have risen about 23% this year. The stock has shed more than 6% since July 8, when it hit a record, part of a broader market selloff led by U.S. megacaps.\nGrowth at AWS is likely to have stayed similar to the previous quarter at just over 17%, according to LSEG data. But, Morgan Stanley analysts said: \"AWS needs to grow 18%+ in order to ... ensure investors of AWS's (AI) positioning and its ability to generate high-teens growth through this heavy capex investment period.\"\nAs a result of the spending increase, Amazon's gross profit margin growth is expected to have slowed to 1.3% in the April-June quarter, compared with 2.6% in the previous quarter and an average of 2.7% over the past two years.\nGrowth in its North American retail business likely slowed to 8% between April and June, from 12.3% in the January-March quarter, amid signs of a wider slowdown in consumer spending and some competition from new and fast-growing Chinese players such as Temu and Tiktok Shop that are enticing more U.S. shoppers.\nAmazon's total revenue is expected to have grown 10.6% to $148.56 billion - the slowest rise in five quarters.\n(Reporting by Deborah Sophia in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Devika Syamnath)\n"

Wedbush analysts said 87% of advertisers who advertise on Amazon said in a recent survey that they increased spending in the second quarter compared to last year, and 91% said they plan to increase their ad spend in the third quarter.\nWhile the financial performance of Prime Day will impact Amazon's third-quarter earnings, investors may be looking for additional clues about how successful this year's 48-hour sales event was. Data from Adobe Analytics found that the event generated an estimated $14 billion in online spending across U.S. retailers, split almost evenly over the two days.\nBank of America analysts said their estimates put Prime Day's gross merchandise value around $13.4 billion, up 10% from last year and better than their projections of a 7% bump, also noting that a record number of Prime signups could help Amazon continue to gain market share in online retail.\nAmazon stock rose 1.5% on Friday, leaving it up about 20% for the year so far.\nRead the original article on Investopedia.\n"

Consumers also spent more on electronics and home appliances, it added.\nAdobe's numbers are not adjusted for inflation. However, it said consumer spending this year has not been driven by higher prices, but new demand.

        "Title": "Amazon sidesteps carbon offset standard Bezos helped fund",
        "Author": "  Virginia Furness ",
        "Text": "(This July 1 story has been corrected to show the companies' plans involved Abacus-certified or equivalent types of credits, not only Abacus-certified credits in paragraph 9)\nBy Virginia Furness\n(Reuters) - Amazon has become the first company to sidestep a global standard for verifying carbon offsets that was developed by a non-profit funded largely by the U.S. technology conglomerate's founder and executive chair, Jeff Bezos.\nAmazon is backing the development of a new standard that could allow the online retailer and cloud-computing provider to overcome a dearth of supply for quality-labeled offsets, enabling it to meet its target of cutting its greenhouse-gas emissions to zero on a net basis by 2040. Critics worry that the move could lead to market confusion and a compromise in the standards of carbon offsets.\nCompanies under pressure to curb their emissions can buy credits from developers of projects that absorb carbon, such as through reforestation. The market for offsets has remained small due to a limited number of projects that can verify their climate benefits.\nAmazon told Reuters it has completed work on Abacus, a framework for verifying the quality of carbon offsets in reforestation and agroforestry. Amazon developed the standard with carbon registry Verra as an alternative to one developed by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM), the world's biggest grouping of private sector and environmental groups dedicated to validating carbon offsets. Verra first announced it was developing the label with Amazon and its Abacus working group in 2022.\nBezos, through his $10 billion Earth Fund that he set up to tackle climate change, is one of ICVCM's biggest donors, having plowed at least $11 million into ICVCM and sister organization Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative since their 2021 launch.\nJamey Mulligan, Amazon's head of carbon neutralization, said in an interview that the company evaluated and supported ICVCM's work, but that it wanted a more ambitious standard.\n\"We want to ensure that every credit investment has a real, conservatively quantified and verified impact on emissions,\" Mulligan said. He declined to comment on whether Bezos was involved in Amazon's decision.\nBezos could not be reached for comment.\nAlphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Salesforce have said they plan to buy up to 20 million metric tons of Abacus-certified or other types of nature-based removal credits.\nPedro Martins Barata, co-chair of ICVCM's panel of experts, said he was worried about development of an alternative standard and that he hoped that Abacus would eventually be folded into ICVCM.\n\"Otherwise, you get again into a confusing state in the market where each set of companies will find their own standards they want to support and they will say that they're a particular type of quality,\" he said.\nMartins Barata added that ICVCM was reviewing Verra's methodology for developing carbon offsets from agroforestry and reforestation projects, and that if it approves it this could make the Abacus label compatible with ICVCM's label.\nKelley Kizzier, director of corporate action and markets at Bezos Earth Fund and a member of ICVCM's board, said Abacus is complementary rather than competitive to ICVCM. She also declined to comment on Bezos' role.\n\"What we need to focus on is generating high-integrity (offsets). There is room for lots of actors to do that,\" Kizzier said.\nThe label will be available within weeks, Verra said.\nOFFSET MARKET\nThe $2-billion market for voluntary carbon offsets has remained small amid concerns by companies and investors that the underlying projects may not curb as many emissions as they claim.\nThe market accounts for offsetting 300 million metric tons of emissions annually, according to an Environmental Defense Fund analysis of data from financial information provider MSCI. Yet only a fraction of those offsets are verified, with ICVCM's main quality label, CCP, accounting for 27 million tons.\n\"My main concern with the strategy remains with the idea that the purchase of these credits somehow 'neutralizes' Amazon's impact. I don't think it does,\" said Gilles Dufrasne, policy lead at environmental non-profit Carbon Market Watch.\nDeborah Lawrence, chief scientist at credit ratings firm Calyx Global, welcomed the label's requirement to make public data on how much carbon the projects store but said it still had questions about Abacus\u2019 ability to ensure the carbon removals are permanent.\n\"Their permanence position requires further investigation,\" she said. \"The way it is phrased is giving us pause, but their annual monitoring and making the results public are great ideas and raise the bar.\"\nAmazon generated 71.3 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2022, according to its latest sustainability report, of which 54.98 million tons came from its supply chain.\nIt will take two to three years for projects to qualify for the Abacus label because many rely on trees growing and then developers proving how much carbon they absorb.\nMulligan said Amazon could become one of the biggest carbon-credit buyers, but that it would not use them in place of the company's efforts to decarbonise its business.\nHe added that Amazon is currently reviewing more than 70 proposals from developers and expects to restore tens of thousands of hectares of degraded land.\nAny developer can apply for the Abacus label provided they meet requirements of Verra's methodology, which the Abacus working group, a team of scientists, non-governmental organizations and industry specialists helped develop.\nEron Bloomgarden, founder of Emergent, a not-for-profit organization that mobilizes private-sector funding for forest countries, said Abacus would help grow the carbon-offset market.\n\"The work of ICVCM is important but it's insufficient for the growth of the market, because what we are trying to do is solve big existential challenges like climate change and biodiversity extinction,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Virginia Furness in London; Editing by Greg Roumeliotis and Rod Nickel)\n"

        "Title": "Amazon Stock (NASDAQ:AMZN): 3 Reasons Why I\u2019m Bullish",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) went public 30 years ago and is among the largest companies in the world. Valued at $2 trillion by market cap, the e-commerce giant has returned more than 160,000% to shareholders since its IPO (initial public offering) in 1997. Despite its outsized gains, I remain bullish on Amazon due to its expanding addressable market, expanding profit margins, and growing advertising business.\nToday, Amazon is a household name and has a presence in most global markets. It sells consumer products, online ads, and subscription services through online and physical stores. In the last 12 months, Amazon reported revenue of $590.74 billion, up from $280.52 billion in 2019.\nAmazon has a sizeable presence in several growth markets that include e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and online streaming. In Q1 of 2024, its Online Store segment increased its revenue by 7% year-over-year to $54.7 billion, accounting for 38% of sales.\nAccording to a report from Research and Markets, the global e-commerce market is forecast to expand from $18.98 trillion in 2022 to $47.73 trillion in 2030, indicating an annual growth rate of over 12%.\nIts Amazon Web Services business accounts for 17% of sales, and this segment grew by 17% year-over-year in the March quarter. A Statista report forecasts the public cloud market to expand from $631.8 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2029, indicating an annual growth rate of 18.5%.\nIn recent years, Amazon\u2019s Advertising Services business has gained significant traction. While it accounts for just 8% of total sales, sales from the segment rose by 24% year-over-year in Q1. A Precedence Research report expects global digital ad spending to rise from $550 billion in 2023 to $1.367 trillion in 2033, indicating annual growth rates of 9.6%.\nWe can see that each of Amazon\u2019s business segments is positioned to grow at a steady pace in the upcoming decade, making the tech giant an enticing investment option right now.\nSimilar to most other companies, Amazon has focused on lowering its cost base to tide over an uncertain and soft macro environment. Since Q4 of 2022, it has eliminated more than 27,000 jobs, allowing it to improve profit margins significantly. In the last 18 months, Amazon has lowered its technology and infrastructure costs as well as sales and marketing expenses, shoring up its bottom line.\nIn the last 12 months, Amazon reported free cash flow of $50.15 billion compared to a free cash outflow of $3.31 billion in the year-ago period. Further, it expects profit margins to improve in Q2 of 2024, although at a far more measured pace.\nAmazon expects operating income to range between $10 billion and $14 billion in Q2 compared to the year-ago figure of $7.7 billion. Comparatively, it expects revenue between $144 billion and $149 billion, indicating year-over-year growth between 7% and 11%.\nHistorically, Amazon has sacrificed profitability for growth. In fact, it reported several quarters of operating losses before reporting consistent profits in the last decade. Currently, Amazon is experiencing strong growth in sales and earnings due to economies of scale, a competitive moat, and its leadership position.\nAmazon owns and operates the third-largest digital ad business after Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Due to higher customer purchase intent, Amazon\u2019s ad business should attract a higher share of corporate marketing spend amid sluggish consumer demand.\nAmazon attributed its strong digital ad performance to sponsored products, which benefited from improvements in relevancy and measurement capabilities for advertisers. It expects sponsored products to drive demand going forward while growing new verticals such as Prime Video ads.\nIn the last three years, Amazon\u2019s ad business has grown from $6.4 billion in Q1 of 2021 to $11.8 billion in Q1 of 2024. Its ad business grew at a much higher pace compared to peers Alphabet and Meta. Moreover, this segment is a high-margin one and should be a key driver of revenue and profitability through 2030.\nWall Street expects Amazon to report an adjusted earnings per share of $4.54 in 2024, up from $2.90 per share in 2023. So, AMZN stock is priced at 44x forward earnings, which is steep, given that the sector median multiple is far lower at 15x. Alternatively, Amazon is growing at a far higher pace, so a premium multiple is justified.\nEach of the 42 analysts covering Amazon stock has a Buy rating, indicating a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average AMZN stock price target is $222.45, indicating upside potential of 11.5% from current levels.\nTwo years ago, Amazon stock was pummelled due to its slowing growth and unattractive profit margins. Today, it is one of the fastest-growing mega-cap stocks on the planet, driving its share price toward all-time highs. In my view, its expanding addressable market and improving bottom line make it a top investment choice for investors in July 2024.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Costco vs. Amazon",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are both categorized as retail stocks, but their varied business models make for some challenging comparisons when trying to determine which is the better investment.\nOne commonality is that both companies are leaders in their respective areas of retail (Costco leads the wholesale brick-and-mortar sector and Amazon is the king of e-commerce). Costco has vastly expanded its online presence in recent years so some comparisons are getting easier. Likewise, Amazon is building a position in grocery stores with its subsidiary Whole Foods.\nOne significant commonality is that they both use a subscription-based model to increase sales and encourage brand loyalty. Costco has found considerable success in offering an annual membership for access to its super competitive product pricing. Amazon's Prime membership gives members access to cheaper and more efficient shipping (as well as other perks). Both companies boast an impressive renewal rate on these memberships. These subscription models pave the way for reliable growth over the long term, helping both companies worry less about product sales and more about membership growth.\nOn the investor side, that steady income is attractive and it has helped both Costco and Amazon stocks deliver market-beating gains over the past several years (see chart above). Even better, both stocks are expected to continue this above-average performance, offering new investors a chance to get in on the continued growth.\nBut if you only had room to add one of these retail stocks to your portfolio, which should you choose? Which one has a better chance to profit from the retail sector's continued growth over the next decade?\nAs measured by market cap, Costco (at $390 billion) is the world's third-largest retailer (trailing only Amazon and Walmart). The company has come a long way during the nearly 50 years it's existed. Costco now operates 879 warehouses across 14 countries. Yet it has barely scratched the surface of its expansion potential.\nCostco's relatively unique business model offers paying club members access to wholesale prices on thousands of products across multiple categories. The company's priorities emphasize quality products and low-margin prices catered to the varied cultures of the countries it operates in. Its earnings continue to rise despite its low margins and investments in international expansion thanks to efficient operations, loyal customers, and steady membership fees.\nOver the past five years, Costco's annual revenue and operating income have jumped 59% and 71%, while free cash flow has soared by 121%. For reference, Walmart's free cash flow fell 14% during the same period.\nAnd despite its steady growth (including achieving 714 locations in North America), the retail giant still has plenty of room to add more stores and grow its footprint. Costco has seven or fewer stores in six of the 14 nations it operates in, suggesting it's only just getting started in those markets. Its expansion will only be helped by the 91% membership renewal rate the company has worldwide, which saw it hit 128 million members in 2023.\nMoreover, e-commerce has become a major growth catalyst for Costco in recent years. In the third quarter of 2024, e-commerce sales rose 21% year over year, more than double the growth from any other segment and even outperforming Amazon's retail growth in the same quarter.\nAs already noted, investors are attracted to Costco's business model. As a result, shares in Costco have delivered triple-digit growth over the last five years. That elevated share price performance has also elevated the stock's valuation well above its 10-year average. That elevated valuation is reasonable, though, given its growth potential.\nLike Costco, Amazon has amassed a considerable user base. Its subscription-based model has seen Amazon Prime gain over 200 million subscribers worldwide, boasting a 99% 2-year renewal rate in the U.S. Prime has become so ubiquitous that roughly 71% of all U.S. Amazon shoppers are members.\nAmazon's annual revenue and operating income have risen by 105% and 153%, respectively, over the last five years, and its free cash flow is up 111%. That growth has come despite the economic turbulence of 2021 and 2022, proving the resiliency of Amazon's business.\nHowever, Amazon's overwhelming presence in online retail has caused e-commerce growth to slow, with sales in Q1 2024 up 5% compared to total revenue growth of 13% year over year. As a result, the company has steadily reinvested its gains into diversifying its revenue streams, becoming one of the most prominent names in tech. The company is home to the world's biggest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and is responsible for a leading 22% market share in video steaming thanks to the success of Prime Video.\nWhile retail continues to deliver sales growth, the company's positions in cloud computing and streaming are boosting earnings even more. In the first quarter, AWS revenue spiked by 17% year over year, while operating income nearly doubled. Meanwhile, advertising services sales jumped 24% year over year after Amazon introduced ads on Prime Video.\nAmazon has built itself into a behemoth in retail and tech. The growth catalysts across both industries make its stock worth considering. Its valuation is elevated compared to an average stock, but low compared to other tech stocks and not bad compared to its 10-year average. Given its growth potential going forward, its valuation is reasonable.\nAs was noted at the top, comparing these two stocks isn't easy. They really are different companies with different factors influencing the investment thesis for each. Finding financial metrics that allow for fair comparisons isn't easy either. How do you fairly compare what is best described as a tech growth stock to what is best described as a retail sector dividend stock?\nEven a basic metric like the price-to-sales ratio (P/S) isn't perfect. The chart below would seem to indicate Amazon is the more expensive stock to buy right now.\nBut expand that chart out over a decade and include 10-year averages, and you see that the answer is more complicated. Amazon stock is actually trading around its average P/S while Costco is trading roughly twice its average P/S over the past decade. That suggests Costco is the more expensive stock.\nIt's fair to say that both Costco and Amazon are killing it in their respective industries, and both companies' stocks are likely to lift any portfolio over the long term. So the choice between these companies really comes down to your investment style.\nAnother look at the chart above shows that Amazon's P/S has been erratic over the past decade, while Costco's has remained more stable. Amazon's focus and earnings are gradually moving away from retail and more into tech, an industry that generally offers significant gains over the long term but can also suffer short-term steep declines from time to time. Costco has offered more reliable growth.\nSo, if you're willing to hold during potential market downturns in order to gain exposure to high-growth markets like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and digital advertising, Amazon stock is an excellent option. If you prefer a steady growth stock (also offering a dividend) that you can just buy and forget about over the next decade, you might be better suited to Costco's stock.\nGiven my investing goals and interests, Amazon is the better buy than Costco at the moment.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Ethan Howland ",
        "Text": "This story was originally published on Utility Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Utility Dive newsletter.\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should reject or hold a hearing process on proposed changes to an interconnection service agreement, or ISA, that would provide power directly from a majority-owned Talen Energy nuclear power plant to an Amazon data center, the PJM Interconnection\u2019s market monitor said Wednesday.\nThe proposed ISA raises market issues, and the agreement could set precedent for co-located load at other nuclear and non-nuclear power plants in PJM, according to Monitoring Analytics, the market monitor.\n\u201cPJM needs to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impact of removing significant levels of generation from the market,\u201d Monitoring Analytics said. \u201cPJM has made a series of critical policy decisions that are embedded in this ISA involving, among other things, how backup power is handled, that are very different from positions that PJM has previously taken on related matters in the stakeholder process.\u201d\nThe market monitor said key questions include: How will load be met in PJM if multiple baseload power plants are effectively removed from the market? How would it affect power flows? How would it affect energy and capacity prices?\nPJM had 32.2 GW of nuclear capacity, making up 18% of its installed capacity as of March 31, according to Monitoring Analytics\u2019 most recent market report.\nTalen said in March that it had agreed to sell a planned data center campus in Pennsylvania to Amazon\u2019s cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, for $650 million. Talen intends to sell power to AWS from its 2,228-MW stake in the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, according to the company.\nAWS has agreed to buy power from Talen in 120-MW increments for the data center, which could grow to 960 MW, according to Talen. AWS also has an option to cap its commitment at 480 MW.\nTo facilitate the sale of power to the co-located data center, PJM in June asked FERC to approve an amended ISA among the grid operator, Susquehanna Nuclear and PPL Electric Utilities. The amended ISA would increase the behind-the-meter connection between the power plant and the co-located data center to 480 MW from 300 MW in the existing ISA.\nAmerican Electric Power and Exelon \u2014 on behalf of their utilities \u2014 challenged the ISA, in part because they claim it could cause an annual shift of up to $140 million in transmission costs onto PJM ratepayers. AEP and Exelon said FERC should start a hearing process to consider the issue, or reject the amended ISA outright.\nThe idea that Amazon\u2019s co-located data center would be completely separate from the grid is an \u201cillusion,\u201d according to Monitoring Analytics.\n\u201cThe co-located load will continue to rely on the grid for a range of ancillary services including frequency control, reactive, spinning reserves, reserves in general, black start, and PJM administrative functions,\u201d the market monitor said. \u201cWhile the proposed amendment to the ISA is creative, its benefits to the co-located load come at the expense of other customers in the PJM markets.\u201d\nIf Talen\u2019s model for supplying co-located data centers is widely adopted in PJM, energy prices would rise significantly as supply is removed from the market, according to the market monitor.\n\u201cThe commission\u2019s decision in this matter, while framed as a narrow issue by Talen, has extremely large significance for the future of PJM markets,\u201d Monitoring Analytics said.\nUnder Talen\u2019s proposed ISA, the co-located load would avoid paying distribution charges and transmission charges and would not be directly regulated by a state utility commission or FERC, according to the market monitor.\nThe Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission told FERC that \u201cquestions of fact and law remain unresolved\u201d related to the proposed ISA amendment and that the agency should hold a hearing to consider them.\nMeanwhile, Constellation Energy Generation and Vistra told FERC\u00a0on Wednesday that the agency should dismiss the concerns raised by AEP and Exelon, saying the proceeding only deals with the interconnection service that PJM provides to the Susquehanna power plant and the ISA amendment.\nThe protest by the utility companies aims to complicate the proceeding by \u201cthrowing spaghetti at the wall in the hope that something, anything, might stick,\u201d the independent power producers said.\n\u201cIt is yet another attempt by AEP and Exelon to deter or outright prevent the development of new data centers, particularly co-located, behind the meter data centers,\u201d they said, citing AEP Ohio\u2019s proposed rates for data center interconnections.\nAEP and Exelon are trying to stop non-utility power plant owners in PJM from serving co-located load so the companies\u2019 utilities would be the only option for meeting the demand for data center infrastructure, Constellation and Vistra said.\nAn adverse ruling by FERC on the ISA will \u201cintroduce regulatory uncertainty about the pace and feasibility of powering these [data center] projects that could jeopardize that economic engine and the national interest,\u201d the companies said.\nNearly all the concern about the ISA is driven by a false assumption that Amazon\u2019s data center will receive services from the grid and shift costs onto other customers, according to Constellation and Vistra.\n\u201cBehind-the-meter configurations like this one likely save the cost of transmission upgrades often required for front-of-the-meter interconnections of loads this large, which could be passed on in some instances to all transmission customers,\u201d they said.\nIf FERC finds there are issues about co-located load that need to be explored, it should direct PJM to conduct a 90-day stakeholder process to do that, according to Constellation and Vistra.\nConstellation owns eight nuclear power plants in PJM totaling nearly 16 GW \u2014 or about half the nuclear capacity in the grid operator\u2019s footprint, which covers all or part of 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states and the District of Columbia. Vistra owns the Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse and Perry nuclear plants in PJM totaling about 4 GW.\nPJM on Monday urged FERC to approve the ISA, saying in part that any review of broad policy issues should be handled outside the proceeding.\nIf FERC approves the amended ISA, the agency will likely take additional action, such as launching a proceeding to consider broader issues around co-located load, ClearView Energy Partners said in a client note Thursday. The research firm said it is \u201cskeptical\u201d FERC will reject the amended ISA. It expects FERC to take action on the issue by an Aug. 3 deadline.\nThere is a \u201cmeaningful\u201d \u2014 but less than 50% chance \u2014 that FERC will launch a hearing process to consider the issues raised by the proposed ISA, which would delay a final decision,\u00a0Morgan Stanley analysts said in a client note on Tuesday.\n\u201cWe continue to believe 1) the ISA between Talen and Amazon is valid and FERC is unlikely to impose major changes or transmission charges on the companies, 2) future data center deals with nuclear plants can continue to move forward, and 3) future data center contracts can be structured and electrical configurations can be set to avoid these regulatory pushbacks in subsequent filings,\u201d the Morgan Stanley analysts said.\nA Goldman Sachs research newsletter issued late last month raises questions about the future of generative AI and whether utilities and other power suppliers would be able to supply the vast amounts of power it requires.\n\u201cAI technology is exceptionally expensive, and to justify those costs, the technology must be able to solve complex problems, which it isn\u2019t designed to do,\u201d Jim Covello, Goldman Sachs head of global equity research, said in \u201cGen AI: Too Much Spend, Too Little Benefit?.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs estimates that about 47 GW of new generating capacity is needed to serve U.S. data center-related load growth through 2030. It would cost about $50 billion, or $7 billion a year, to build the new generation, with transmission and other related infrastructure costing more, according to Carly Davenport, a senior U.S. utilities equity research analyst at the investment firm.\n\u201cBetween generation, transmission, and distribution needs, we expect the utility companies in our coverage universe [will] spend nearly 40% more from 2024-2027 relative to the prior four-year period, amounting to roughly $140 [billion] on average annually,\u201d Davenport said.\n"

Let's dive into why these tech giants should be on your watchlist, or even better, in your portfolio right now.\nThis market is undeniably strong and seems to make new record highs daily. How can investors best take advantage of a raging bull market like we have today?\nIn a market regime like this, the best approach is to seek stocks that are expected to outperform the market, but with limited downside risk. My preferred method of doing this is screening for stocks that have top Zacks ranks and are showing relative strength against the market index.\nEven better if they have thematic tailwinds like Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing and Digital media transformation.\nAdditionally, we should try to avoid stocks that have uber-high valuations as well, as they increase the downside risk.\nIn the chart below we can see that each of the stocks picked today are displaying impressive momentum and are outperforming the market year to date.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFirst up, we have the e-commerce behemoth, Amazon. While some might hesitate due to the recent market pullback, there are compelling reasons to consider AMZN. For one, Amazon is currently trading at its cheapest valuation in a decade.\nToday's forward earnings multiple of 41.2x sits well below its 10-year median of 97.3x, presenting a deep historical discount.\nThis attractive valuation comes despite Amazon's continued dominance in e-commerce and its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is a major growth driver for the company, boasting a dominant market share in the cloud computing industry.\nThis segment is expected to keep expanding rapidly, providing significant tailwinds for Amazon's future earnings.\nFurther bolstering the case for AMZN is the company's impressive earnings growth trajectory. Analysts are projecting a robust 29.6% annual growth in EPS over the next 3-5 years.\nThis combination of a discounted valuation and strong earnings growth makes Amazon a compelling investment opportunity for those seeking exposure to the ever-growing tech sector.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNext on our list is the music streaming giant, Spotify. While some investors might be wary of companies with limited profitability, Spotify's future looks bright. Earnings are turning positive in a big way this year and analysts are forecasting a staggering 76.1% annual growth in earnings per share (EPS) over the next 3-5 years. This explosive growth potential is a major reason why investors are taking notice.\nBecause of these tremendous growth forecasts in earnings, Spotify enjoys a relatively discounted valuation. Today, SPOT is trading at a forward earnings multiple of 60x, which is extremely high. But with the earnings growth forecast, it has a PEG ratio of 0.8, which is a discount based on the metric.\nSpotify isn't just about impressive forecasts; it's also delivering on the stock price front. The company has experienced powerful stock price momentum, indicating strong investor confidence in its future. This combination of sky-high EPS growth forecasts and a surging stock price makes Spotify a compelling option for investors seeking high-growth potential in the tech sector.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRounding out our list is ASML Holdings (ASML), a Dutch company that holds a near-monopoly in the production of photolithography machines. These machines are the unsung heroes of the modern tech world, responsible for etching the intricate patterns on silicon wafers, the foundation of computer chips.\nBecause of its mission critical status in the production of semiconductors, it has very long-term growth tailwinds thanks to technology\u2019s endless creep into our lives. Furthermore, it plays a crucial role in the function of Artificial Intelligence, as its machines will be required for the development of chips used in the technology.\nIn addition to its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, ASML Holdings also boasts a very bullish technical setup.\nASML stock has been coiling and breaking out all year, and if the stock can trade above the $1,100 level, would again signal another imminent leg higher.\nImage Source: TradingView\nBottom Line\nThe tech sector remains a powerhouse, offering exciting opportunities for investors. As earnings season approaches, we can anticipate further confirmation on how these companies are executing in this environment.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Ryan Vanzo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Back before the 2000s, Warren Buffett was well known for his general disdain for tech stocks. During the dot-com bubble back in 1999, he (rightly) warned that most internet start-ups would eventually flop. According to reports, this warning resonated deeply with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos. \"[Bezos] changed his method of managing the company,\" says Milton Berg, a former advisor to George Soros and Stanley Druckenmiller. \"He didn't want Buffett to be right.\"\nMore than two decades later, Amazon is still in business, having become one of the largest companies in the world, with a market cap of $2.1 trillion. As for Buffett, he eventually adjusted his views on tech stocks, and his holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) owns several tech stocks and has become one of Amazon's largest shareholders.\nAccording to the latest 13F filings, Berkshire's publicly traded portfolio includes around 40 stock holdings. Amazon is the 17th largest holding on the list, with a total stake of 10 million shares worth roughly $1.8 billion. That represents 0.1% of Amazon's total share count. Berkshire has owned Amazon stock since the first quarter of 2019. Since then, the share price has more than doubled.\nBerkshire's original stake was valued at around $860 million. According to Buffett, the investment was initiated by one of his lieutenants, either Todd Combs or Ted Weschler. At the time, Buffett jokingly added that he had been \"an idiot\" for not initiating the investment himself. Share price appreciation has contributed most to Berkshire's growing stake in Amazon, but the firm hasn't remained steadfast in its investment. It sold some Amazon stock as recently as last summer when it trimmed its stake by 550,000 shares.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "You are reading an exclusive WrapPRO article for free. Want to level up your entertainment career?\u00a0Go here for more information.\nAmazon doubled its net income in the second quarter of 2024 to $13.5 billion, which it attributed largely to growth in its cloud-based Amazon Web Services (AWS). Net sales for its subscriptions services segment, which includes Prime Video, grew 10% to $10.87 billion in the quarter.\nHere are the top-line results:\nNet income:\u00a0$13.49 billion, up 99% from $6.7 billion a year ago.\nEarnings per share: $1.26 per share, compared to $1.05 expected by analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.\nRevenue: $148 billion, up from $134.4 billion last year, compared to $148.6 billion expected by analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.\nShares of Amazon, which reported its results after the bell on Thursday, climbed more than 7% in after-hours trading. As of Thursday\u2019s close, the Amazon\u2019s stock price was up 23% this year.\nCEO Andy Jassy noted Amazon\u2019s 11-year deal to secure the media rights for the NBA and WNBA, but most of Thursdays\u2019s earnings presentation focused on AWS and AI.\nNorth American segment sales for AWS were $90 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase. Sales for the international segment also increased by 7% over the same time period, clocking in at $31.7 billion. When accounting for changes in foreign exchange rates, the year-over-year increase was closer to 10%. Total segment sales for the period were a reported $26.3 billion, a 19% increase compared to Amazon\u2019s second quarter in 2023.\nAmazon\u2019s subscriptions segment also saw growth. That division includes annual and monthly fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships as well as digital video, audiobook, digital music, e-book and other non-AWS subscription services.\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing to make progress on a number of dimensions, but perhaps none more so than the continued re-acceleration in AWS growth,\u201d Andy Jassy, president and CEO of Amazon, said in the second quarter earnings letter.\nJassy said that AWS continues to be a \u201ctop choice\u201d as companies continue to modernize, move to the cloud and explore opportunities using Generative AI. He pointed to four AI tools as being beneficial to the growth of AWS: SageMaker, a cloud-based machine-learning platform that was designed for model builders; Bedrock, a tool that connects AWS users to foundation models from leading AI companies like Meta; Trainium, a machine-learning chip that is built for deep learning training and serves as a more affordable option for customers; and Q, Amazon\u2019s GenAI assistant for developers.\n\u201cThe reality right now is that, while we\u2019re investing a significant amount in the AI space and infrastructure, we would like to have more capacity than we already have. We have a lot of demand right now, and I think it\u2019s going to be very, very large business for us,\u201d Jassy said.\nAI has been a major factor during this round of earnings. Last week, Alphabet reported growth through Google\u2019s implementation of AI Overview, which provides its search users near-instant answers to their queries based on sources from around the web. This consumer-facing use of AI has increased engagement from users 18 to 24 years old. The company also announced it would be launching new ways to incorporate AI into search, including the introduction of a VR lenses and new features for Gmail and Google Photos.\nAs for Apple, the tech giant introduced Apple Intelligence last quarter. The upcoming personal intelligence system will put private generative AI models into the company\u2019s iPhone, iPad and Mac products.\nAmazon executives also mentioned Prime Video ads, which launched this year, as a sponsor product that is driving growth. At its launch in January, Prime Video estimated that its ads would reach 115 million monthly viewers in the U.S. This year also marked the first time Amazon attended the upfronts in New York, a series of presentations catered to potential advertisers.\nThe post Amazon Doubles Q2 Net Income to $13.49 Billion on Strength of Amazon Web Services appeared first on TheWrap.\n"

But the e-commerce giant is becoming increasingly important in the shoe shopping journey as a whole.\nAbout one third of consumers said they start their shoe shopping journey on Amazon, according to the 2024 U.S. Consumer Footwear survey from global consulting firm AlixPartners and the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America (FDRA).\nThe survey found that consumers treat Amazon as a search engine, filtering out the types of shoes they want based on images, reviews, colors and product availability. However, when it comes to actual purchases, most (63 percent) of consumers say they expect to buy all or most of their shoes in stores. Just 10 percent of respondents said they plan to make nearly all their shoe purchases online, while 27 percent plan to buy a majority of their shoes online.\nAfter Amazon, 21 percent of consumers say they do their window shopping on brand websites and 16 percent use search engines.\n\u201cWhile consumers remain relatively committed to finalizing their purchase in store, the internet increasingly influences spending decisions,\u201d said FDRA president and chief executive officer Matt Priest. \u201cThis means critical steps in the process of finding the most shoe for the buck \u2014 from assessing brands to researching models or comparing prices \u2014 are taking place online. Retailers and brands cannot afford to rely on a single-channel approach to winning the battle for attention and dollars in a crowded footwear marketplace.\u201d\nIn the last year, some shoe brands \u2014 including those that were historically direct-to-consumer \u2014 have leaned into Amazon as part of a refreshed wholesale strategy. In November, Allbirds launched on Amazon with some select styles like the Wool Runner, Tree Runner and Tree Breezer. And in May, Rothy\u2019s debuted its Amazon\u2019s storefront that includes styles like The Point, The Flat and The Driving Loafer. Crocs is also seeing some early benefits from converting its Amazon presence to a third party business model in which Crocs sells its products directly to consumers via the Amazon marketplace.\nOn the flip side, brands that have abandoned Amazon have opened themselves up to negative consequences. For example, when Nike cut ties\u00a0with Amazon in 2019, it lost control over its brand identity on the platform. According to Rutger Wismeyer, an e-commerce management consultant based in the Netherlands, this gave room for resellers to potentially gain total control over Nike\u2019s price, look and customer journey.\n\u201cAs a brand, you need to be where the consumer is,\u201d Wismeyer told FN earlier this month. \u201cAnd that\u2019s including Amazon, specifically in the US, but also in Europe.\u201d\n\n\nBest of Footwear News\nA Look Inside Kith Seoul, the First Kith Flagship in South Korea: Photos\nHow Fifth Avenue Has Evolved Through the Years\nA History of Stuart Weitzman: The Man, the Brand, the Million-Dollar Shoes\nSign up for FN's Newsletter.

        "Title": "Can Amazon Compete with Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft in the Market Cap Race?",
        "Author": "  Jennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft regained the title of most valuable company in the world after briefly falling behind Nvidia with the latter's recent stock split. However, it's been playing second fiddle to Apple for years and only recently slid into first place since Apple has been under some pressure.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is only in fifth place on the list of U.S. companies with the highest market caps, also behind Alphabet. It has extraordinary growth opportunities in several of its businesses, and the second-highest sales of any U.S. company behind Walmart. Can it become the most valuable company in the world?\nMarket cap is simply the price per share multiplied by the outstanding share count. In other words, it's the total dollar value of all of a company's stock. Amazon stock trades at $193 per share, and there are 10.4 billion shares outstanding, so the market cap is over $2 trillion. That makes it the fifth most-valuable company on the stock market.\nAs you can see in the chart above, Apple had been the most valuable company until recently, when Microsoft took over and Nvidia briefly topped it.\nMarket cap tells investors a few things. Highly valued companies are best in class, and they have proved that over time. Investors have piled in because these companies perform, quarter after quarter, and they're large businesses that drive the economy. In general, you can count on them to deliver, and they're low risk.\nBut highly valued companies might offer less growth for investors, since they're already so valuable. For the top three stocks here to even double at this point, they would be worth more than $6 trillion.\nIs it possible? Yes. But that comes with its own risk, since they would need to sustain their high value. It's easier to see Amazon or Alphabet doubling from where they are today.\nIn terms of valuation, none of these stocks are cheap. They all get a premium valuation for their reliable track records and incredible businesses. Nvidia tops them, trading at 73 times trailing-12-month earnings, and Amazon comes in second at 55.\nAmazon struggled a bit, like many companies, when inflation started soaring in 2022. It rebounded already last year, but the stock only surpassed its previous highs a few weeks ago, and it could be in its best position in a long time.\nOne reason is generative artificial intelligence (AI). It's today's hot topic, but it might have more staying power than other recent trends like cryptocurrency and the metaverse, and Amazon is a major player.\nIt has launched a powerful set of AI tools for its Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients, and as the leading worldwide cloud computing company, it stands to benefit in a big way from adoption of these tools. According to consulting company McKinsey, as much as 30% of workplace hours could be automated through generative AI, and it could add $4.4 trillion to the economy.\nAmazon is at the forefront of these endeavors, and CEO Andy Jassy recently said, \"I don't know if any of us have seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time.\"\nBut it's not just AI, with Jassy adding, \"We have a lot of growth in front of us, and that's before the generative AI opportunity.\" He said that AWS is already a $100 billion run-rate business, and that 85% of global spending on information technology is still on-premises, meaning not in the cloud. That leaves a massive opportunity for further spending in AWS.\nAnd AWS isn't even its biggest business, which is still e-commerce. Amazon has an unbeatable lead in that category globally and accounts for nearly 38% of all U.S. e-commerce. It has made strides in improving logistics to get more deliveries out faster, and as it speeds up shipments, more shoppers rely on it for even more of their daily essentials, leading to a positive growth cycle.\nThe company's fastest-growing business these days is advertising, which increased 24% year over year in the 2024 first quarter. It's a high-margin business, and with its new ad-supported streaming tier for Prime Video, Amazon is finding more ways to monetize its advertising capabilities.\nIt has an edge in this business because when customers see advertisements on the company's platform, they're already looking to buy, and that can lead to incredible conversion rates.\nAmazon can certainly muscle its way to the top of the market-value chain, just as it's pushing ahead and getting closer to becoming the largest U.S. company by sales. Regardless, it has tremendous opportunities in many ways, and its stock is a no-brainer buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 11 Trump Trades: Winners and Losers.\u00a0Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer in a latest program talked about the consequences of the failed assassination attempt on Donald Trump and mentioned a few stocks that could benefit if the former President comes to power again.\n\u201cYou are sticking your head in the sand if you think nothing has changed after the failed assassination attempt on the now-official Republican nominee for President.\u201d\nCramer said that the \u201cfrightening moments\u201d of the assassination attempt have indeed \u201ccut in the favor\u201d of Trump\u2019s win and he was \u201calready leading in the polls.\u201d\nCramer recalled the days when he was the anchor of Kudlow & Cramer show and Biden was a senator from Delaware. Cramer said Biden once told him that he was the \u201cpoorest senator out of one hundred because he owned no stocks.\u201d\n\u201cHe was actually bragging about it,\u201d Cramer said.\nCramer said that Joe Biden is not the \u201cchampion\u201d of stocks and he\u2019s \u201con board with labor.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what Cramer said about Trump\n\u201cIn the many years I\u2019ve known Trump and I have known him fairly well, he\u2019s been wildely pro stock market, always watching it like a hawk. He loves bantering about the stock market.\u201d\nCramer said that even though Trump was in \u201creal estate, he enjoyed stocks.\u201d\nJim Cramer added that Trump always thought there was too much regulation and was also \u201cwildly\u201d pro-oil and gas.\u00a0 The CNBC host said since Trump cannot see the stock market going down and sees the market gains as a positive factor even for his presidency, his arrival in the White House could boost stock portfolios.\n\u201cHate him or like him, he\u2019s good for your portfolio.\u201d\nFor this article watched the latest programs of Cramer where he mentioned stocks that could benefit from a Trump presidency. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nKen Wolter / Shutterstock.com\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\nJim Cramer thinks Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) could benefit from a Trump presidency amid regulatory factors. The CNBC host said Amazon has been in the \u201ccrosshairs\u201d with the FTC.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to gain on the back of its AWS business which is set to benefit from the rise in AI spending. Mizuho recently cited a survey conducted by one of its partners which shows that AWS sales cycle is seeing acceleration. Mizuho analyst James Lee reiterated his Outperform rating on the stock and gave a $240 price target. \u00a0The survey shows that spending on AWS is expected to rise about 22% year over year in 2024, up from the previous estimate of 20%, as generative AI projects are seen at an \u201cinflection point\u201d with external models about six months away from commercial deployment.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0doesn\u2019t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled \u201cchatbot recommendations\u201d as Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN)\u00a0strength in the application layer of AI.\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:AMZN) operates the world\u2019s leading e-commerce marketplace and the largest public cloud platform and has a burgeoning advertising business. We expect to see sustained margin improvement as Amazon\u2019s retail regionalization efforts are bearing fruit and as its advertising business continues to scale ahead of peers. We believe the profitability ramp is still in the early innings as the company turns its attention to improving costs. One area will be inbound shipping, where faster delivery times through reduced freight, miles and packaging can reduce waste. We also see generative AI tailwinds and infrastructure modernization driving re-acceleration in growth at AWS, further enhancing Amazon\u2019s free cash flow compounding potential. In addition, following our early 2024 ESG engagements with Amazon (after multiyear engagements) we were positively inclined to see continued improvements in labor relations (health and safety metrics, benefits and wages), as well as in environmental stewardship (climate targets, reducing packaging materials, electric delivery trucks) and innovation (commitments to responsible AI and data privacy). One of the newly announced initiatives on the retail side is consolidating deliveries into fewer boxes, which reduces packaging.\u201d\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 11 Trump Trades: Winners and Losers. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Josephine Nesbit ",
        "Text": "If you frequently shop online, you\u2019ve probably heard of the e-commerce site called Temu. The Chinese-owned marketplace isn\u2019t exactly known for its quality, but you may be able to find some genuine items that rival Amazon prices.\nCheck Out: Don\u2019t Waste Your Money on These 5 Unreliable Appliance Brands\nRead Next: How To Get $340 Per Year Cash Back on Gas and Other Things You Already Buy\nAccording to ZDNET, Temu is the number one shopping app in Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play store. The store offers almost everything you can think of, including clothing, bags, appliances, furniture, power tools and much more. Temu is a legitimate website, but some shoppers have said that the items they\u2019ve ordered look different on the website or were lower quality than expected.\nAmazon may soon be using supply-chain operations by directly shipping some off-brand items from China to the U.S., according to an Amazon presentation viewed by The Wall Street Journal. But right now, you may be able to find a much better deal by shopping through Temu.\nHere are the best deals on legit items that are cheaper on Temu than on Amazon.\nBamboo sleepers aren\u2019t cheap. Even on Amazon, this highly-rated Kyte zipper closure bamboo footies cost between $35 and $40 each. Temu sells a variety of similar bamboo sleepers for around $10 each, like this popular Miozing infant bamboo fiber sleeper with an all-over bear print.\nIn a video, YouTuber Filosophy purchased newborn bamboo sleepers from Temu and said the quality is comparable to that of more expensive brands you can find on Amazon.\nJudging by the online photo alone, Temu and Amazon sell the same exact four-pack of fake potted plants. On Temu, the plants sell for $6.83 and for $9.99 on Amazon (originally priced at $14.99). However, YouTuber Oh!MGlashes reviewed both products and said Temu\u2019s product was significantly smaller than Amazon\u2019s. If you don\u2019t mind the size difference, then Temu may be the better option.\nIt\u2019s never too early to get a jump start on back-to-school shopping. Temu sells a variety of school and office supplies, including this pack of four zipper transparent pencil cases for $6.98. Amazon sells the same pack of cases for almost double the price at around $11.99. Reviews on Temu said the bags were better than expected, and you can use them for school supplies, makeup, sewing items or as a small travel bag.\nBrushes are a frequently purchased item on Temu, and this natural bamboo hair brush is only $0.78 on Temu. The closest match on Amazon is $7.97. In a video review, YouTuber Jordan Budgets said the Temu brush is much smaller, but the one from Temu is well-made. Unless you have thicker hair, the Temu brush will work just as well as what you\u2019d find on Amazon.\nPhone cases are another popular item on Temu; most cost under $5. This clear iPhone case is only $1.28 on Temu and has thousands of shopper reviews. Amazon also sells a variety of phone cases, but a similar case sells for $14.99 (originally priced at $18.99). Temu reviewers said the phone case was sturdy, fit the phone well and looked exactly as advertised.\nTemu and Amazon both sell a 4-in-1 universal jar opener. However, the item is listed on Temu for $1.99 and on Amazon for $9.99 (originally $19.98). Temu shoppers say this item works just how it\u2019s supposed to and has become one of the most used items in the kitchen.\nTemu sells a very similar multifunction vegetable chopper for $11.86 compared to the $19.99 (originally $29.99 ) veggie chopper on Amazon. YouTuber Oh!MGlashes purchased both items and tried both out on camera. She said the Temu version worked, but you need to push it a little bit harder to get the same results.\nStill looking for the perfect Stanley dupe? Temu sells a 40-ounce insulated travel mug with a handle, a leak-proof lid, a straw, and a stopper for $8.08. YouTuber Filosophy says this is the perfect affordable dupe and is nearly identical to the much more expensive Stanley tumbler. Similar items can be found on Amazon, such as this O\u2019Jay insulated tumbler for $16.99 (originally $34.99).\nMore From GOBankingRates\n20 Best Cities Where You Can Buy a House for Under $100K\n9 Best Items To Buy at BJ's Wholesale Club Now for the Second Half of 2024 To Save Big Money\n5 Genius Things People With Healthy Savings Do\n5 Myths About Debt That Nobody Should Believe in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 8 Legit Items That Are Cheaper On Temu Than Amazon\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 22, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Nvidia NVDA.\nMany in the market are looking to the two members of 'the Magnificent 7' who report quarterly results this week to help reverse the stock market's recent weakness.\nThe immediate catalyst for the stock market pullback appears to be renewed uncertainty about regulatory and trade policies following the November elections, particularly with respect to export restrictions on semiconductor players. That said, we are in a seasonally soft time of the year and should perhaps resist the temptation to read too much into the recent weakness of the Mag 7 stocks, particularly given these stocks' impressive runs already.\nTeslais in a league of its own (up +21.3% since July 1st), while Microsoft (down -2.3%) and Alphabet (down -2.2%) are roughly tracking each other.\nThis pecking order, with Tesla at the top and Amazon and Nvidia at the bottom, is completely reversed when the starting point is changed to the start of 2024 instead of the start of 2024 Q3.\nWe have Tesla and Alphabet on deck to report Q2 results this week, both reporting after the market's close on Tuesday, July 23rd.\nThe current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS for Alphabet of $1.85 has remained unchanged over the last two months, as has Tesla's Q2 EPS estimate of $0.62.\nFor Alphabet, the Q2 estimates of $1.85 per share on $70.6 billion in revenues represent year-over-year changes of +13.7% and +28.5%, respectively. Tesla's Q2 EPS estimate is -31.9% below the year-earlier period on +0.8% higher revenues.\nBoth stocks move big on the earnings release, but the EPS surprise isn't always the most important factor behind the stock's post-release reaction. Alphabet shares were up following the last quarterly release on April 25th, with the market appreciating the company's cloud results and AI outlook.\nTesla missed on the top and bottom-lines in the April 23rd quarterly release, but the stock was up following the numbers as the market liked the company's performance on the deliveries front. In fact, Tesla shares have been on a steady uptrend since the April 23rd release, reversing the persistent underperformance of the preceding period.\nThe other Mag 7 players will report the following week, with Nvidia being the last one to release quarterly results on August 28th.\nThe group is expected to bring in +25.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.3% higher revenues.\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. The group returned to the 'regular/normal' growth model last year, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +15.5% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues.\nAs with the Mag 7, the Tech sector dealt with the pulled-forward revenues but is expected to remain firmly in growth mode.\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trend. The current +17.2% earnings growth expected for the group is up from +14.2% three months ago. Estimates for next year have also gone up.\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, July 19th, we have seen Q2 results from 71 S&P 500 members, or 14.2% of the index's membership. Total earnings for these 71 index members are up +8.7% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 83.1% beating EPS estimates and only 53.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\nThe Q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week, with more than 500 companies on deck to report results, including 135 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Alphabet and Tesla, this week's line-up includes a representative cross-section of reports from different sectors, including bellwethers like Verizon and AT&T, UPS, Coke, GM and Ford, Spotify, IBM, Chipotle, and others.\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, 53.5% is a new low for this group of 71 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues. This will be the highest quarterly growth pace since the +10% earnings growth rate in the 2022 Q1 period.\nAs we have been flagging all along in this space, we experienced a notably favorable revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season, with estimates for Q2 holding up far better than other recent periods. In the three-month period from the start of the quarter through June 30th, Q2 estimates for the S&P 500 index fell the least relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.\nNot only is the Q2 earnings growth the highest since the first quarter of 2022, but the absolute level of aggregate earnings for the period is also on track to be a new all-time quarterly record.\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.8% on +1.6% revenue growth.\nThe expected revenue growth pace improves to +3.9% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +8.7% on an ex-Finance basis.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q2 Earnings Season Starts Positively\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Walt Disney's ESPN, Comcast-owned NBCUniversal and Amazon.com have clinched the rights to carry National Basketball Association games in an 11-year deal valued at $77 billion, the league said on Wednesday.\nThe NBA rejected a last-minute offer from Warner Bros Discovery's TNT Sports division, which it said fell short of Amazon's proposal, ending a four-decade relationship with the media company after next season.\nA spokesman for TNT Sports could not immediately be reached for comment.\nAnalysts have said winning telecast rights requires a huge financial commitment considering the cost as well as the fees associated with production.\nAbout 75 regular-season games will be on broadcast TV each season, up from the minimum of 15 games under the current agreement, NBA said.\n\"Our new global media agreements with Disney, NBCUniversal and Amazon will maximize the reach and accessibility of NBA games for fans in the United States and around the world,\" said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver.\n\"These partners will distribute our content across a wide range of platforms and help transform the fan experience over the next decade.\"\nThe deal represents a blow to Warner's sports division, adding to investor concerns about its role in the new sports-streaming partnership with Disney and Fox.\n\"A lawsuit could follow but it'd be risky,\" said Ross Benes, Emarketer's television and streaming analyst. \"Even if WBD won a hypothetical suit to get the NBA back, it'd be stuck working with an angry NBA who it just sued. Such action could also spook other leagues from striking deals with them.\"\nCEO David Zaslav had said earlier this year the company \"was hopeful\" it would reach an agreement with the NBA to keep the league on Max and TNT.\nThe NBA has contributed a sizable amount to Warner's profit over the last four decades through advertising dollars across to the company's linear portfolio and streaming services.\nTom Forte, senior consumer internet analyst at Maxim Group, said professional sports leagues are prioritizing \"companies it believes can pay it the most today, and in the future, for the rights to broadcast their games.\"\nThe Women\u2019s National Basketball Association announced separately that it renewed partnerships with Disney and Amazon and signed a new deal with NBCUniversal. The agreements will allow the companies to distribute more than 125 WNBA regular-season and playoff games.\n'A BROAD AUDIENCE'\nLongtime league partner Disney will carry a total of 80 regular-season NBA games, including 20 contests on the ABC Network.\nABC will remain exclusive home of the NBA Finals, which it has broadcast since 2003.\nNBCUniversal will pick up 100 regular-season NBA games, with more than half airing on NBC. Its sister service Peacock will stream a doubleheader each Monday night of the season.\nThe network also will telecast one of the two Conference Finals series in six of the 11 years of the contract, which it will carry on a rotating basis with Amazon, beginning with the 2025-26 season.\nAmazon also will carry 66 regular-season NBA games on Prime Video each season, including at least one game on Black Friday.\nThe NBA adds to Prime Video's growing roster of live sports offerings, which include NFL and NASCAR in 2025.\n\"Our streaming base is becoming larger than a lot of cable networks in the U.S.,\" said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios. \"We're bringing a broad audience, and also, when you look at our 'Thursday Night Football' ratings, they're younger.\"\n(Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Devika Syamnath and Bill Berkrot)\n"

        "Title": "Amazon Putting Pieces in Place to Offer Satellite Internet Service",
        "Author": "  Rich Smith, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After years of delays, in October 2023 Amazon\u00a0(NASDAQ: AMZN) took its first step toward offering its very own satellite internet service. Competing with SpaceX's Starlink, Amazon launched a pair of prototype Kuipersats to orbit to begin trials. Last month, the company announced its next step in the process and...\nSurprise! It's going to be another delay.\nLate last year, shortly after launching its test satellites, Amazon boasted it would begin launching operational satellites in the first half of 2024, and then quickly open up the service to beta users this same year. Now, that already was a pretty ambitious target. As I pointed out at the time, SpaceX itself needed 15 months of testing its prototype Starlinks before shifting into mass production -- and then needed 17 more months to build and launch enough satellites to be able to begin offering beta service.\nThat's 32 months total, versus Amazon promising beta service roughly a year after starting testing.\nAnd now, Amazon has hit a new bump in the space road. Those satellite launches that were supposed to begin in early 2024? They haven't happened yet. And as SpaceNews reported last month, Amazon has now postponed delivery of its first batch of operational Kuipersats to later this summer, and postponed any launches until sometime in late 2024.\nPrecisely when Amazon will begin launching its Project Kuiper satellites isn't yet known -- and Amazon isn't telling. NextSpaceFlight.com, though, currently has four Kuiper missions penciled in for indeterminate dates in Q4 2024 -- two launches using ABL Space Systems RS1 rockets (which have never flown before), one using a Blue Origin New Glenn rocket (eight years under development, and also hasn't ever flown), and one with a United Launch Alliance Atlas V (the most reliable option).\nSubsequent to that, Amazon has three launches scheduled for Q2 2025 (all using SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets)... but curiously, zero launches scheduled for Q1 2025!\nThis could be a problem for two reasons.\nFirst and most obviously, because Amazon can't realistically begin a beta launch of its Kuiper internet service until it has a substantial number of satellites in orbit. How many satellites Amazon needs is unknown. SpaceX, for example, put 1,000 satellites in orbit before announcing its own \"beta.\" But it's unclear how many launches Amazon will need to hit a similar mark.\nFor what it's worth, Amazon says each rocket launch will carry \"dozens\" of satellites. But even assuming payload sizes similar to SpaceX's Starlink flights (which carried about 50 satellites per launch initially), this implies Amazon may be as many as 20 rocket launches away from its own \"beta.\" The four launches scheduled for later this year probably won't do the trick.\nNor is this Amazon's only problem. Amazon says Project Kuiper needs a total of 3,236 satellites to be complete, and based on that number, the Federal Communications Commission issued the company a license conditioned on its putting at least half those satellites -- roughly 1,600 -- in orbit by July 2026. Although Amazon has done a good job lining up carriers to accomplish the task -- 92 separate launches scheduled to take place over a five-year timespan -- it's July 2024 already.\nNow, Amazon has just two years remaining in which to get half of these five years' worth of launches done.\nAnd it hasn't even started yet.\nSo all that's the bad news. But there is some good news for Amazon and its space internet ambitions.\nIn a statement on its About Amazon blog last month, Amazon boasted that it's \"accelerating satellite production and testing\" at its new 172,000-square-foot factory in Kirkland, Washington. Encouragingly, the company said the factory will eventually be producing five satellites per day. Assuming around the clock production, this implies the factory should be able to churn out more than 1,800 satellites per year, and in fact produce all 3,236 satellites needed to build Project Kuiper in under two years.\nUltimately, this lends some credence to Amazon's assertion that \"we remain on track to begin offering service to customers next year.\" The satellites will be ready. The only question now is how fast Amazon's space contractors can launch them -- and how flexible the FCC will be about changing the conditions of Amazon's license when it (probably) misses its deadline.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "1 Phenomenal Stock That Could Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena ",
        "Text": "The pace of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption has only accelerated over the past year and has shuffled the ranks of some of the world's largest companies, with several household names vying for bragging rights. Microsoft currently leads the pack, having unseated Apple, each with a market cap of roughly $3.4 trillion. Nvidia's rise through the ranks has been breathtaking to behold, having nearly tripled over the past year to take the third spot at $3 trillion. Several other major purveyors of AI, namely Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms, boast valuations of between $1.3 trillion and $2.3 trillion.\nWith a market cap of just $49 billion (as of this writing), it might seem like sacrilege to propose that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, might be headed for the $1 trillion club. However, the accelerating adoption of AI has increased the need for servers capable of running and training AI systems, and the company's long track record of success makes Supermicro a clear candidate for inclusion in this elite fraternity.\nWhile Supermicro has made a splash in recent years, investors might be surprised to learn the company has been creating customized servers for more than three decades. The accelerating adoption of generative AI shone a spotlight on the under-the-radar server maker, bringing it out of the shadows.\nSupermicro's claim to fame is the company's highly customizable building-block architecture, which helps the company provide server solutions for customers of all sizes and shapes. Furthermore, Supermicro's long focus on energy efficiency has taken on greater significance as cost becomes a factor. It also offers a variety of free-air, liquid-cooling, and traditional air-cooling technologies, giving each customer just what they're looking for.\nThe company has partnerships with all the leading chipmakers, giving it access to the most in-demand AI processors. This includes strong working relationships with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others.\nThis approach has served the company well. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), Supermicro's revenue surged 200% year over year to $3.85 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $6.65 jumped 308%. Management is guiding that its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year guidance to revenue of $14.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $23.69, which would represent growth of 109% and 100%, respectively.\nManagement reports that Supermicro is growing at nearly 20 times the industry average, which clearly shows the company is taking market share from the competition. Analysts at Bank of America agree, suggesting Supermicro will increase its market share from 10% last year to 17% by 2026.\nSupermicro is one of the premier names in the AI server market. The company's agility has been paramount in taking share from its rivals, as its building-block server architecture means it has something for everyone. Supermicro has also established critical partnerships with the chipmakers that supply the company with the most requested processors, giving it ample supply to meet the accelerating demand.\nDespite those advantages, it will still be some time before Supermicro ascends the ranks to become a trillionaire. According to Wall Street, Supermicro is poised to generate revenue of $14.9 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 3.3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $305 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nIt's important to put this in context: The company is ramping up its production capabilities just to be able to generate sales of $25 billion annually, so a nearly 20-fold increase in revenue is still off in the distant future.\nIf the company were able to keep up its triple-digit year-over-year growth rate, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap by 2029. However, keeping up that frantic pace of growth for five years would be unparalleled for a well-established company. Yet, even if we cut its growth rate in half, Supermicro could hypothetically reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2032.\nWhile that might sound far-fetched, the evidence suggests it's more likely than you might think. BofA analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya posited the AI data center market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% over the coming three years, and by taking share from its rivals, Supermicro's revenue could \"grow even faster.\"\nHe's not the only one who thinks the data center upgrade cycle is about to take off. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes the installed base of data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years to support the accelerating adoption of AI.\nSo if Supermicro is successful in capturing even a small part of that fast-growing market, the path to the $1 trillion club will be paved with profits.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 17.14%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online retailer would post earnings of $0.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.13, delivering a surprise of 36.14%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\nAmazon , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $147.98 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.44%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $134.38 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nAmazon shares have added about 23.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 15.8%.\nWhile Amazon has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Amazon: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

        "Author": "  Wendy Culverwell ",
        "Text": "Amazon Inc. is at hiring warehouse workers in Pasco and the proof is in the parking lot.\nDelivery trucks and passenger vehicles fill the lot at 1351 S. Road 40 E., one of two massive warehouses the Seattle e-commerce giant built starting in 2021 to fulfill customer orders.\nOn Monday morning, Amazon was offering warehouse associate jobs in Pasco with openings available for 11 shifts. The advertised pay rate was up to $20 an hour, a 50 cent bump from the advertised rate a week ago.\nAmazon opens jobs in Pasco in waves, with new posts generally posted Friday evenings. Last week, no jobs were available by the end of the week.\nThe warehouse is expected to open later this month. It will employ 1,000-1,500, in addition to 150 more jobs planned at a separate Amazon delivery station facility being built east of the Tri-Cities Airport.\nThe hustle and bustle was a welcome change after Amazon temporarily paused its warehouse expansion plans in 2022, leaving the original two Pasco warehouses empty.\n\u201dIt is gratifying to see Amazon\u2019s progress hiring and taking steps closer to opening the distribution centers. This will be a long-term term boost to our regional economy and we welcome all the economic growth Pasco is experiencing,\u201d said Colin Hastings, director of the Pasco Chamber of Commerce.\nAmazon revived progress in Pasco this year when it said it would open one of its two warehouses as an Inbound Cross Dock to sort and redistribute incoming merchandise. Some job posts have said work could start later in July.\nAmazon has not publicly shared its plans for the second vacant warehouse on South Road 40 East, referred to as \u201cProject Pearl\u201d in planning documents. Pasco building permits place the construction value of the two warehouses at $260 million.\nIt was not immediately clear how many people have been hired so far in Pasco.\nWorkSource Columbia Basin teamed with Goodwill Industries and Columbia Basin College to conduct weekend events that helped more than 260 job seekers connect with Amazon, said Ajsa Suljic, regional labor economist for the Washington state Employment Security Department.\nYou can monitor Amazon job postings at hiring.amazon.com.\nStay up to date on Tri-Cities growth and development with our weekly business newsletter.

        "Title": "Why Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best Drone Stock to Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Drone Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other drone stocks.\nThe term \"drone\" refers to any remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), which can vary in form and autonomy, either controlled by a human pilot or capable of fully autonomous flights. In 2005, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) adopted the term \"unmanned aircraft system\" (UAS) to describe these aerial drones. This terminology was later adopted by other governmental agencies globally, highlighting the importance of considering various system components rather than focusing solely on the aircraft for regulatory development. The rapid evolution of drones began with the advancement of defense technologies, enabling the remote piloting of aircraft equipped with both weaponized and non-weaponized systems. These larger military drones, often weighing several kilograms, are crucial for deployment in environments too dangerous for human pilots. Today, smaller drones are employed by various government agencies for a range of operations, including precision agriculture mapping and surveillance.\nThe Russia-Ukraine war, which began in February 2022, has driven a significant increase in demand for drones, as both militaries employ them for various operations, including intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and target acquisition support. The unprecedented scale of Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) deployment caught both Ukrainian and Russian forces unprepared for such extensive use. However, both militaries have rapidly advanced their drone technology, frequently modernizing and adapting these systems directly on the front lines. In a statement this past year, Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs, stated \"This war is a war of drones; they are the super weapon here.\" With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and increasing legislative support, the drone market seems poised for significant growth.\nAnother trend involves the development of specialized drones tailored for specific industries. These industry-specific drones are equipped with sensors, cameras, and software designed to meet the unique requirements of sectors such as agriculture, construction, and inspection. These 'Consumer' and 'Recreational' drones have become a common part of daily life, particularly among drone hobbyists. As of April of this year, over 780,000 drones were reportedly registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with 375,226 classified as commercial and 400,858 as recreational.\nThe U.S. commercial drone market was valued at $5.85 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach approximately $14.11 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.2% from 2024 to 2033. In 2023, the rotary blade segment held the largest market share at around 81%, while the hybrid segment is anticipated to experience the fastest growth, with a CAGR of over 11% during the forecast period.\nOn the other hand, a report by MarkNtel Advisors states that the global military drone market was valued at approximately $20.21 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of about 12.21% from 2024 to 2030. This rapid growth is driven by the widespread adoption of Extended Visual Line of Sight (EVLOS) UAVs for long-range missions focused on data collection, battle management, and electronic warfare. A notable example of this technology came in the form of General Atomics' testing of advanced datalink and avionics enhancements for the MQ-1C Gray Eagle Extended Range (GE-ER) drone back in 2022.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the best drone stocks to invest in, we first sifted through ETFs and online rankings to come up with a preliminary list. Next, we scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 920 hedge funds and selected the 8 drone stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple, our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy picks 14 small and large-caps every quarter and it has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\nA prominent leader in technology and e-commerce, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been making substantial advancements in the drone industry. The company's Prime Air program is shifting to smaller, quieter drone models with the six-rotor MK30. This faster, lighter, rain-resistant drone is expected to be available at the company's three testing sites and in cities in Italy and the U.K. by late 2024. These drones will operate from the same inventory facilities as Amazon's delivery trucks, offering customers a new delivery experience.\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is solidifying its position as a leader in AI, driven by its AWS business, which achieved operating margins over 37% in the first quarter. AWS operating margins have consistently exceeded 30% for the past five quarters. Additionally, Amazon's first-quarter revenue increased by 12.5% year-over-year, and its adjusted EPS more than tripled.\nMoreover, JPMorgan recently reiterated its Overweight rating on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with a price target of $240. This decision followed an in-depth analysis of the U.S. e-commerce landscape, including category penetration and Amazon's market share. The research suggests that Amazon is on track to surpass Walmart as the largest U.S. retailer by 2024, with long-term e-commerce penetration potentially exceeding 40%.\nAs of March 31, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) had 302 hedge fund investors out of 919 funds tracked by Insider Monkey. The largest stakeholder was Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management, with 42.5 million shares valued at $7.6 billion.\nVulcan Value Partners stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a dominant, world class company with powerful secular tailwinds in place including its ecommerce penetration, digital advertising growth, and the cloud transition. Amazon reported strong results during the quarter. Losses in the Core Retail business significantly narrowed. Amazon reduced its cost to serve on a per unit basis for the first time since 2018 as the company\u2019s recent regionalization efforts continue to bear fruit.\u201d\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best drone stocks to buy. You can visit 8 Best Drone Stocks to Buy Now\u00a0to see the other drone stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Hannah Sparks ",
        "Text": "Jeff Bezos has a tip to help you take the best slice out of your professional life.\nThe Amazon boss created the \u201ctwo-pizza rule\u201d for his team during the early days of the company\u2019s launch 30 years ago \u2014 a tenet that could boost your career and financial success.\n\u201cWe try to create teams that are no larger than can be fed by two pizzas. We call that the two-pizza team rule,\u201d Bezos has previously said.\nThe billionaire entrepreneur has argued that larger teams are difficult to manage and can become overwhelmed with mounting responsibilities, whereas a small team \u2014 of about 10 folks or so \u2014 the rule ensures teams of workers are the right size to be most efficient and productive.\n\u201cIdeally, this is a team of less than 10 people: smaller teams minimize lines of communication and decrease bureaucracy,\u201d Daniel Slater Amazon Web Service\u2019s head of culture and innovation explained, per the Daily Mail. \u201cThe two-pizza structure also promotes team accountability. Two-pizza teams do not hand over something they\u2019ve launched to another team to run.\u201d\n\u201cAs such, two-pizza teams need to stay on top of every part of their service, with a clear charter and a tightly defined mission,\u201d Slater concluded.\nAt Amazon, any team that grows beyond this two-pizza cap should be split into two teams, with the responsibilities of the original group being divided between the newly restructured teams.\nBezos said this guide has helped the revolutionary retailer maximize efficiency and scalability \u2014 Amazon\u2019s two pillars of success \u2014 making it one of the world\u2019s biggest companies.\nThe two-pizza rule isn\u2019t just good for business. Finance experts at GoBankingRates say it encourages individual workers to view their time as money.\nPurchases should be viewed in terms of how much time it would take to earn it. For example, a $20 pizza would cost 30 minutes of time at work for someone who earns $40 per hour. Keeping this in mind helps earners avoid unnecessary spending and maintain perspective on their personal wealth.\nBezos\u2019 rule is also about breaking down big goals into many small tasks. The same approach helps individual workers ensure they\u2019re not biting off more than they can chew, and can swiftly pivot from one task to the next.\nHowever some business impresario, such as Johnny Warstrom, CEO of Mentimeter, have criticized the hard-and-fast maxim.\n\u201cI find Jeff Bezos\u2019 two-pizza rule outdated and in need of a revamp,\u201d Warstrom\u00a0wrote in Entrepreneur.\u00a0\n\u201cLimiting the number of meeting participants does not increase productivity,\u201d the CEO explained. \u201cIn fact, it hinders it. Smaller teams limit the chance for a broad and diverse perspective.\u201d\n"

        "Author": "  Dawn Allcot ",
        "Text": "On July 16, the first day of Amazon Prime Day 2024, 7.5% of shoppers used buy now, pay later plans to afford the things they wanted or needed during the big sale. Adobe Analytics data revealed that this represented a 17.1% uptick compared to last year.\nConsider: 10 Best Ways To Make Money in Retirement With Amazon\nLearn More: Become a Real Estate Investor for Just $1K Using This Bezos-Backed Startup\nWhile people across demographics use BNPL programs as a way to add flexibility to their budgets, these programs can work particularly well for retirees on fixed incomes. Even if you have retirement income other than Social Security to draw from to make ends meet, you still might need to rely on credit to cover necessary expenses. BNPL programs let you do that without having to resort to credit cards.\nAmazon offers two payment plan programs, along with a layaway plan. None of these programs require a credit check.\nRetirement Planning: Whether you're planning for retirement, dealing with a significant life event or simply looking to make smarter financial decisions, a financial advisor can offer the expertise and guidance you need. Here are some compelling reasons why you should consider a financial advisor -- even if you're not wealthy.\nAffirm is a BNPL program with interest rates ranging from 10% to 36%, although you\u2019ll occasionally find a promotional 0% offer. No credit check is required, and you can find out if you qualify within seconds.\nPayment terms vary based on the product\u2019s price. For purchases of $50 or more, you can choose to pay over two months (four bi-weekly payments) or six months. Purchases over $100 offer the option of stretching payments out over 12 months. Payment terms increase from there, up to 48 months for a purchase of $1,500 or more.\nAffirm is available for millions of items on Amazon, including electronics, home goods, furniture and appliances.\nCheck Out: 4 Overpriced Products Retirees Shouldn\u2019t Waste Their Money\nFor those who qualify, Amazon also offers interest-free, no-fee monthly payment plans. However, these plans are only available on certain items and may not be available to every shopper.\nIf you qualify, you can pay off your purchase in equal monthly installments, the number of which you\u2019ll see in your offer, with the first payment due at the time of purchase.\nYou\u2019ll need to keep a valid payment method on file for Amazon to charge the payments. You can pre-pay your installment plan at any time, with no penalties.\nIt\u2019s important to note that Amazon can suspend or terminate your account for non-payment. If you\u2019ve used the plan to purchase an Amazon device, such as a Fire TV, Amazon can deregister the advice, blocking your access to content, if you fail to make a timely payment.\nFinally, Amazon offers a layaway plan for purchases that you don\u2019t need immediately. You can use Amazon layaway to start Christmas shopping early or pay for a large birthday present over time, prior to the event.\nTo use layaway, put 20% down and then make four more payments over eight weeks. If you receive your Social Security checks monthly, you can essentially spread the payments over three checks. You\u2019ll pay no interest or fees. Your item ships after you make the final payment.\nBorrowing money for purchases isn\u2019t ideal, but there\u2019s no reason you should sacrifice the items you need \u2014 or want \u2014 as long as you budget carefully. Amazon\u2019s payment plans make it easy to make purchases today, especially when the items are on sale, and pay over time.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThese Are America's Wealthiest Suburbs\n6 Used Cars That Will Last Throughout Retirement\n5 Moves Every Woman Should Consider Before Retirement\nThis is The Single Most Overlooked Tool for Becoming Debt-Free\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: How To Make Amazon\u2019s Monthly Payment Plans Work in Your Retirement Budget\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Amazon\u2019s AMZN shares have gained 31.2% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the Zacks Internet Commerce industry\u2019s return of 22.4%. The e-commerce giant is riding on the solid momentum in its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d).AWS is benefiting from the growing customer momentum across the world on the back of its strong cloud computing capabilities. Its strengthening cloud infrastructure in various emerging and developed nations is a major positive.The company recently joined forces with the Australia government to build \u2018Top Secret\u2019 AWS Cloud (TS Cloud) for Australia\u2019s defense and intelligence agencies. This initiative will allow agencies to host sensitive information securely, which, in turn, will help Australia improve the nation\u2019s cyber capabilities and deepen security cooperation with the United States.The Australia government plans to invest AU$2 billion ($1.3 billion) over the next decade in the new cloud system. Under the agreement, Amazon will construct three facilities in the country.TS Cloud will make the sharing of classified data between Australia\u2019s National Intelligence Community and the Australian Defence Force seamless. It will also power the nation\u2019s security with AI and machine learning.The latest deal underscores AWS's global experience, security, performance and ability to dedicate thousands of engineers to a project.Moreover, AWS\u2019s commitment to driving innovation, economic growth and digital transformation across Australia reaches a new height with this deal. Last year, it launched its second infrastructure region in Melbourne, Australia. Through the AWS Asia Pacific (Melbourne) region, AWS strives to invest $4.5 billion by 2037 and support 2,500 full-time jobs annually.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAWS has strengthened its footprint in the APAC region on the back of the latest deal.Per a Research and Markets report, the cloud market in the APAC region is expected to witness a CAGR of 15.1% between 2023 and 2030. Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service and Software-as-a-Service are gaining strong momentum in APAC.Amazon is well-poised to capitalize on this growth opportunity on the back of its expanding APAC footprint.AWS recently announced plans to launch an AWS infrastructure region in Taiwan by early 2025. The region will be known as the AWS Asia Pacific (Taipei) Region.The cloud giant is also gearing up to launch an infrastructure region in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2026.AWS plans to launch an infrastructure region in Malaysia, in which it strives to invest $6 billion by 2037 and support job creation in the country.It intends to pump in 2.26 trillion yen ($15.24 billion) in Japan by 2027. With this investment, AWS strives to boost its cloud infrastructure across the country, especially in Tokyo and Osaka.AWS plans to open a region in Bangkok, Thailand, and set up an infrastructure region in Auckland, New Zealand, comprising three availability zones.The launch of an infrastructure region in Israel, located in Tel Aviv, namely, AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region, is another positive.Expanding presence in the promising APAC region is expected to aid the performance of AWS, which, in turn, will drive Amazon\u2019s overall performance in the long run.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $638.24 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of 11%. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 0.9% to $4.58 per share over the past 60 days. The figure indicates year-over-year growth of 57.9%.\nAmazon, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is expected to remain at the top of the competition graph on the back of aggressive expansion efforts in APAC. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Amazon\u2019s peers like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL and Alibaba BABA are also leaving no stone unturned to expand their presence, given the booming scenario in APAC.Microsoft\u2019s Azure is gearing up for the opening of five data centers in APAC, namely South-Central India, Indonesia Central, Malaysia West, New Zealand North and Taiwan North, which will be located in Hyderabad, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Auckland and Taipei, respectively.Microsoft Azure also plans to launch a Saudi Arabia Central region.Meanwhile, Alphabet\u2019s Google launched a data center in Japan in 2023, marking its third such establishment in Asia. The facility is located in Inzai, Chiba. Google\u2019s opening of a data center in Singapore is also noteworthy.Google\u2019s opening of cloud regions in India\u2019s New Delhi and Australia\u2019s Melbourne last year is an uptrend. The search giant\u2019s opening of cloud regions located in Doha, Qatar, and Dammam, Saudi Arabia, is another positive.Alibaba is hugely investing in expanding its presence in the cloud market of the underlined region. In regard to APAC, the company has data centers located in Singapore, Australia, Philippines, India, Thailand, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Indonesia.\nAmazon\u2019s strength in AWS, which is riding on expanding clientele, strong partner base and growing global presence, is expected to boost its long-term prospects. Its deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives.Amazon currently has a Value Score of B, which makes it an attractive pick for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If the last few years have anything to teach us, it's to never bet against America's big tech. With shares up 104% over the previous five years, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has navigated both the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2022 inflation crisis while keeping shareholder value intact (although it was a bumpy ride). Let's explore what the next half-decade could have in store for the diversified technology conglomerate. \nWhile Amazon has successfully diversified itself into businesses ranging from cloud computing to artificial intelligence (AI), its foundation remains e-commerce. In 2022, this sprawling segment had begun to underperform because of COVID-era overexpansion and high inflation, which squeezed consumer purchasing power. But now, those challenges are in the past.\nAmazon's first-quarter net sales rose 13% year over year to $143.3 billion. But more importantly, its operating income surged more than threefold from $4.8 billion to $15.3 billion over the same time frame.\nThis transformation was partially driven by significant cost savings in North American e-commerce (where management increased operating income by 455% to $4.98 billion) and international e-commerce (where they swung from a loss of $1.25 billion to a gain of $903 million). Amazon's new decentralized fulfillment network and layoffs are transforming its bottom line, allowing it to focus on exciting new growth drivers.\nAmazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), will be the key to its future growth. Like with e-commerce, management has targeted significant layoffs here. And it has paid off, with operating profits jumping 84% to $9.4 billion. \nOver the next five years, investors can expect this segment to enjoy continued growth as it benefits from increased AI-related demand -- particularly from start-ups like Anthropic, which uses its industry-leading cloud platform for storage and data management.\nAmazon boasts its own custom AI training chips (Inferentia and Trainium), designed to attract clients to AWS's cloud services by offering competitive training speeds at potentially lower costs.\nBut growth plans aren't limited to AWS. According to the Financial Times, management aims to develop a new retail channel to ship goods to American shippers directly from warehouses in China. Delivery times will be significantly longer than Amazon's typical one-to-two-day waits but will involve significant cost savings for consumers.\nUnlike AWS, this new retail channel probably won't generate high-margin growth. However, it could help Amazon protect its market share from low-cost Chinese rivals like Temu (a subsidiary of PDD Holdings) or Shein.\nLong-term investors should always consider valuation when picking a stock because this data shows how much of your buy thesis has already been priced in by other market participants. For Amazon, a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 43 means its shares are valued slightly higher than the Nasdaq-100 average of 31.\nThis looks like a fair premium to pay, considering the company's bottom-line momentum and new growth opportunities in AI technology. The stock looks likely to continue outperforming over the next five years. And it's not too late to buy. \nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $751,670!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": "  Surfshark B.V. ",
        "Text": "Chart\nThe smart home market has been growing steadily for almost a decade. According to Statista, the number of smart home device users is expected to rise from 424.5 million to a record high of 785.16 million by 2028. Smart devices today can be anything \u2014 from pillows to showers and toilets \u2014 and many require an app, which in turn requires our data. \nBut with showers and mattresses collecting data, is home still our most private place? Surfshark\u2019s recent study, Smart Home Privacy Checker, revealed that 1 in 10 smart home apps collect data for the purpose of user tracking. Amazon and Google have developed the most data-hungry smart home device apps, which are used by millions daily.\u00a0 \n\"In an era where convenience frequently takes precedence over privacy concerns, our latest research has uncovered a troubling trend in smart home device apps, notably from tech giants like Amazon and Google. It is important to understand that this issue extends beyond just data collection; it encroaches upon the intimate aspects of users\u2019 lives, which, if mismanaged, could lead to data theft, security breaches, and the unsanctioned, uncontrolled dissemination of personal information to third parties. Users must be made aware and given the means to reclaim their digital privacy,\" states Goda Sukackaite, Privacy Counsel at Surfshark. \nWhy should we be concerned? \nAccording to Surfshark\u2019s analysis, various smart home apps often collect large amounts of personal data, including names, contact info, emails & text messages, and even browsing history. After gathering data, apps may track you to show targeted ads or share your information with third parties and data broker companies. These companies use your personal information for purposes like targeted advertising, credit risk assessment, or market research. Thus, you might end up paying twice for using these apps \u2014 once for the device and again with your data.\u00a0 \nWhat can we do to protect our privacy?\u00a0 \nSmart devices collect vast amounts of data, yet most consumers will likely continue using them for convenience. So, how can we protect our privacy while using them? According to Goda Sukackaite, if you use smart devices, you should: \nSeek out and utilize privacy settings;\nActively manage app permissions and question those that seem excessive;\nDisable unnecessary microphones and cameras on smart devices and evaluate if the app asking to use your microphone or camera really needs it to perform its function;\nStay informed about the data security policies of the smart home devices you choose;\nCheck what information is collected by your smart device apps and choose the ones that are less invasive of privacy. To check what data is collected by smart device apps, you can visit Surfshark\u2019s Smart Home Privacy Checker.\nWhich apps collect the most data? \nAccording to Surfshark\u2019s study, Amazon's Alexa collects 28 out of 32 possible data points \u2014 over three times more than the average smart home device. This data is linked to individual user profiles and includes precise location, contact information (email, phone number), and health data.\nGoogle gathers a little less than Amazon, collecting 22 out of 32 possible data points. That's still nearly triple the amount typically collected by other smart home devices. Like Amazon, Google links all collected data to the user. Some of the most notable collected data points are address, precise location, photos or videos, audio data, browsing, and search history.\nOutdoor security cameras collect the most user data among smart home devices, and within this category, the Deep Sentinel and Lorex apps are the most invasive.\nWhat\u2019s the way forward for smart home devices and data collection? \nOur data is highly valuable, especially to third-party advertisers, data brokers, and other entities that use it to build their businesses. As more of our essential details and documents \u2014 such as signatures, passports, and bank accounts \u2014 move online, data protection becomes increasingly more important. Many countries are already enacting stricter data protection laws, such as the GDPR in Europe, to address potential privacy issues.\nHowever, stricter laws will not help if we, as users, agree to share our data without a second thought. We need to be more vigilant about where and how our data is utilized. This means reviewing the permissions we grant to our devices and apps, scrutinizing privacy settings, and considering whether an app or device actually needs the information it requests. Data protection starts with our actions and our permissions. Therefore, the best way to safeguard your personal information in the future is to take greater responsibility for it personally. \nMETHODOLOGY \nThe Smart Homes Privacy Checker scrutinized 290 applications connected to over 400 Internet of Things (IoF) smart home devices, selecting apps corresponding to 64 device types highlighted for their popularity in online articles about IoT device searches. Surfshark's Research Hub analyzed the data from the apps' listings on the Apple App Store, examining 32 potential data points across 12 categories, emphasizing user uniqueness, tracking, and linkage. The most invasive apps were then ranked considering the number of unique data points collected, the scope of tracking-related data points, and the amount of data linked to users.

        "Title": "MercadoLibre Is Beating Amazon in 1 Important Category in Latin America. Here's Why Investors Should Take Note.",
        "Author": "  Jon Quast, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's a clear heavyweight advertising champion in Latin America, and it's not even particularly close: MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI) is trouncing Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in this category. One research group predicts the former's advertising business will continue to skyrocket over the next few years, as I'll explain. And it shouldn't come as any surprise to anyone who knows how retail media works.\nMercadoLibre has multiple segments. But one of its biggest and best is its e-commerce platform. Like Amazon in the U.S., MercadoLibre has the largest platform in many countries in Latin America, including Brazil, allowing third-party retailers to sell products to a large, captive audience.\nFor perspective on the scale, MercadoLibre had nearly 54 million people buy something from its e-commerce marketplace in the first quarter of 2024, which was up 16% year over year. These are people navigating to the platform and spending time on there searching around. Advertisers would love to get in front of that audience.\nIn the U.S., the same is true of advertisers with Amazon. The company has multiple ways to generate ad revenue, so it's not all attributable to the e-commerce platform. But if we rewind the clock back to the first quarter of 2021, Amazon generated $6.4 billion in ad revenue, which was impressive enough. But in Q1 2024, it had $11.8 billion in ad revenue -- up more than 80% in just three years, demonstrating clear advertiser demand.\nThere are millions of people browsing Amazon everyday with the intent to buy something. That's attractive for advertisers. All the company had to do was sell spaces on its platform for advertisers to promote their products and services -- a high-margin proposition for Amazon. And it's something that's increasingly important for MercadoLibre.\nAccording to management, MercadoLibre's advertising business equaled 1.9% of its gross merchandise volume in the first quarter of 2024. Considering it had gross merchandise volume of nearly $11.4 billion, this translates into Q1 advertising revenue of roughly $216 million. This was up a whopping 64% year over year.\nOne of the most respected research groups for advertising is eMarketer, and it expects MercadoLibre's advertising growth to continue to impress. This year, eMarketer believes MercadoLibre will generate advertising revenue of over $1 billion for the first time. But by 2026, it expects the e-commerce giant will produce advertising revenue of nearly $2 billion.\nAccording to eMarketer, MercadoLibre has a roughly 50% market share for retail media (advertising slots sold by retailers) in Latin America. Amazon is next, with about one-quarter of the market. But given that MercadoLibre is the bigger player, it's logical that it would be the more in-demand platform for advertisers.\nIt's impossible to tease out the exact benefit that advertising brings to MercadoLibre's financials. But over the last three years, as advertising revenue has soared, the company's operating income is growing much faster than revenue. And this improved profitability with growth is exactly what investors want to see.\nWhen thinking about its advertising revenue potential, the question to ask is whether MercadoLibre can remain the dominant player in its markets. I believe it can for multiple reasons.\nThe first thing to consider is MercadoLibre's network effect. There are roughly 12 million sellers using the e-commerce platform. As its base of active buyers keeps growing, the opportunity for sellers increases, which could attract even more sellers. If new sellers bring new products, it could in turn attract new buyers. As the largest player in the region, this network effect is stronger for MercadoLibre than others.\nAnother thing to consider is MercadoLibre's impressive logistics network. The company made 115 million same-day or next-day shipments in Q1 alone. In this part of the world, this speed and scale is hard to beat and can be a competitive advantage. In other words, shoppers will buy from this platform because of how speedy its service is.\nFor these reasons, I believe MercadoLibre will stay at the top of the e-commerce game in Latin America. Digital advertising is spreading in the region, making its platform a top choice for advertisers. I consequently believe that the company will keep growing this lucrative advertising revenue stream in the coming years. And if eMarketer is right, advertising revenue could double for MercadoLibre before 2027, which could help support a higher stock price.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you\u2019d have $21,904!*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $43,562!*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $349,245!*\nRight now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee 3 \u201cDouble Down\u201d stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of July 8, 2024\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "Author": "  Samantha Dorisca ",
        "Text": "Through diligent effort, Black Girl Sunscreen has achieved substantial earnings.\nAs AFROTECH\u2122 previously mentioned, the company was launched by Shontay Lundy in 2016 through a personal investment totaling $33,000. She was inspired to venture into entrepreneurship after suggestions from friends to wear sunscreen while hiking in Los Angeles, CA, led her on a search for products \u2014 with few catering to Black skin.\nRecognizing a gap in the market, she worked to create a hydrating product that would not leave behind the unfavorable white residue often listed as a complaint in the Black community.\n\u201cThere is a little bit of Shontay in all of my products,\u201d Lundy told AFROTECH\u2122 at the time. \u201cWhat was important for formulating these products was considering what is important for women of color and Black women. We don\u2019t want anything to dry out our skin so while creating Black Girl sunscreen, this and no white residue were the most important factors.\u201d\nThe company now carries several sunscreens and more recently launched a lip gloss made with Broad Spectrum SPF 50,\u00a0hyaluronic acid, tripeptides, and jojoba.\nIts products have proven to be a success in the market too. Black Girl Sunscreen became available in 250 Target stores in 2019 and later launched in Ulta, Walmart, Kohl\u2019s, and more by 2023. Additionally, in 2020, $1 million in private funding was raised, bringing its valuation to $5 million at the time.\nNow, the company is celebrating another million-dollar feat. Lundy reveals the company has earned $1.1 million in its first three months on Amazon. However, it followed after removing bad actors from the platform who were profiting from the company\u2019s name, image, and likeness.\nShe acknowledged the milestone on Instagram and concluded with a call to action for exercising caution with your brand.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s new with Black Girl Sunscreen is that we hit $1.1 million today in about three months on Amazon.com\u2026 This is important because previous to us being on this platform, we had a lot of bad actors posing as Black Girl Sunscreen, literally using our images, our name, our likeness, and selling products as Black Girl Sunscreen,\u201d Lundy said in a video shared on Instagram. \u201cSo we came on the platform and wiped them all out, and now we\u2019re getting the money for us, for our business.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cSo Black Girl Sunscreen, the 2-ounce, has sold 20,000 units in one month. 20,000 units. And when I think about that, I think that that could be going to an unauthorized seller. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to see what\u2019s going on with your brand on these other platforms.\u201d\n"

        "Text": "This story was originally published on Marketing Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Marketing Dive newsletter.\nAmazon today (July 18) launched its 2024 back-to-school marketing campaign in addition to announcing the return of its \u201cDorm Roomz\u201d video series timed to the off-to-college season, per details shared with Marketing Dive.\nKey to the back-to-school campaign is a 30-second ad starring actress Michelle Buteau who encourages parents to spend less through Amazon\u2019s Back to School shopping guide. The ad will air from July 18 to Aug. 18 in the U.S. and from July 29 to Sept. 2 in Canada.\nA separate \u201cDorm Roomz\u201d video series yields tips for creating the ultimate dorm room for less and includes tie-ups with influencers and Philadelphia 76ers draft pick Jared McCain. The recurring series will span premium online video, digital and social through Aug. 18.\nAmazon is again centering its back-to-school advertising around affordability, messaging that could be welcomed amid a season expected to see a spending pullback. Estimated market spend for the period is $31.3 billion, down from $31.9 billion the year prior, according to Deloitte findings. Spending from low- and middle-income families is expected to be lower than levels in 2023, down 4% and 9%, respectively.\nThe e-commerce giant\u2019s 30-second back-to-school ad stars actress and comedian Buteau, who begins the ad by saying, \u201cI love my kids, but I also love not being broke,\u201d before vowing to spend less this season by using Amazon\u2019s Back to School shopping guide. The star then highlights everything that can be purchased from Amazon for less, like a \u201cwater bottle they definitely won\u2019t lose,\u201d tablets and lunchboxes before closing out the ad by encouraging shoppers to \u201cspend less on your little freeloaders.\u201d\nThe ad was directed by Ramy Youssef (\u201cPoor Things\u201d) and will run in the U.S. through Aug. 18. The spot draws a number of similarities from past back-to-school ads from Amazon, including last year\u2019s ad starring actor Randall Park, who presented the idea of spending less on back-to-school shopping as novel. Previously, Amazon teamed with Kathryn Hahn, who encouraged parents to \u201cgo ahead and spend less\u201d on their kids.\nAlong with its back-to-school campaign, Amazon also announced the return of its \u201cDorm Roomz\u201d video series, which offers tips for creating the best dorm room \u201cvibes\u201d for less. The series offers a comedic take on classic home tour videos and this season will feature basketball star McCain along with other influencers, who will show off their college staples from Amazon\u2019s Off to College shopping guide. The series will begin airing July 18 across premium online video, digital and social including Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat through Aug. 18.\nWhile affordability has similarly been a focus for other back-to-school marketers like Target and JCPenney, others have sought a more emotionally driven approach. Last week, BIC announced a tie-up with singer-songwriter Charlie Puth to promote its 4-Color Ballpoint Pen with a campaign focused on boosting self-expression among students. In another example, Urban Outfitters launched a social-heavy \u201cShift Happens\u201d campaign nodding to the changes young people experience around pivotal events like going back to school.\nAmazon reported 13% year-over-year revenue growth to $143.3 billion in Q1 2024, and its revenue derived from advertising was up 24% YoY to $11.82 billion during the same period. The company just wrapped its popular Prime Day sales event, which was held from July 16-17.\n"

The company is significantly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Amazon.com Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$3.64\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.31%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 0.00% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n21.45\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n9.12\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n80.32\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $54.92. This valuation indicates that the Amazon.com Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -264.17%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "1 Solid E-Commerce Stock That's Not Amazon to Keep On Your Radar",
        "Author": "  Lawrence Nga, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the most remarkable companies in the last two decades is arguably Amazon, which rode the e-commerce tailwind to great success.\nWhile the e-commerce tailwind is ongoing, investors will likely not make enormous gains with Amazon's stock. After all, the company is already worth more than $2 trillion in market capitalization.\nThe good news is that there are other smaller but well-established e-commerce companies that investors can keep an eye on. MercadoLibre Inc (NASDAQ: MELI), the leading e-commerce company in Latin America, is one of those candidates.\nMercadoLibre is a rare tech company with a solid growth track record that spans almost two decades, yet it is still \"small\" enough to make a difference in your portfolio.\nFounded in 1999, MercadoLibre caught the attention of the then-leading e-commerce platform eBay, which bought a 19.5% stake in the company. The Latin American company went public in 2007, and since then, revenue has grown from just $52 million in 2006 to $14.5 billion in 2023 -- or more than 278 times. It's the clear leader in this region, significantly ahead of even Amazon in market share.\nSo, what did the company do right? Well, many things. Topping the list is MercadoLibre's localized approach to managing its business. It deeply understands Latin America and uses that knowledge to tailor its operations, services, and strategies. This localized approach means the company can recruit the right people to make the right decisions and execute quickly. Besides, the tech company's deep understanding of its markets helps it build a solid brand that resonates well with customers.\nThe tech company has also been highly innovative, constantly iterating and offering new products and services to delight its customers. For instance, it leverages customer relationships and trust in the brand to launch adjacent services such as digital payments and fintech. These services strengthen its relationship with customers and help it build a vibrant and growing ecosystem in this region.\nIt is also worth mentioning that MercadoLibre has always had its founder, Marcos Galperin, leading the company over the decades. The benefit of a founder-led company is that it can focus on the long term, making bets and taking decisions that matter in the long run -- such as to delight its customers and subsequently create value for shareholders.\nIn short, MercadoLibre has done many things correctly over the years, which explains its solid performance over this period.\nOne of the biggest concerns that growth investors have is whether a company making billions in revenue, like MercadoLibre, is still well-positioned to grow. While most large companies will inevitably face growth bottlenecks as they expand, this doesn't seem to be the case for this e-commerce leader -- at least, not in the near future.\nTo put it into perspective, the company grew revenue by a solid 37% in 2023 to $14.5 billion. Net income performed even better, doubling from $482 million to $987 million. That's a remarkable performance, considering that the company was already generating more than $10 billion in revenue!\nThere are many drivers to that. First, Latin America's e-commerce market penetration remains low compared to countries like China and the U.S., giving it plenty of room for growth. Besides, as countries in this region still grow in per capita gross domestic product (GDP), the growing disposable income will likely contribute further to consumption.\nInternally, MercadoLibre is constantly working to delight its customers, which will naturally lead to higher spending over time -- after all, online shopping is a habitual activity. Moreover, the tech company is constantly experimenting with new services, which will help grow customer wallet share further.\nOne major downside is that competition has intensified in recent years thanks to the entrance of new players like Shopee, Shein, and Temu. But given the vast opportunity ahead, there will be enough room for multiple players.\nMercadoLibre is a rare company with a combination of a long growth track record, profitability, and prospects for growth in the coming years.\nStill, there are risks involved. The company is an overseas business subjected to issues like foreign exchange and cultural differences. The stock is also not cheap -- it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 74 times.\nHowever, for investors looking to benefit from the e-commerce tailwind, MercadoLibre should be on the radar.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late.

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Morgan Stanley analysts are setting a bullish tone for the upcoming earnings season, with specific companies expected to outperform. According to the analysts, investors should watch Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) closely, as these companies are anticipated to deliver strong results.\nAmazon is highlighted with a \"Positive\" near-term view. Morgan Stanley expects Amazon to deliver a significant EBIT beat in Q2 and guide positively for Q3.\n\"We are 17% above Street EBIT\" for Q2 and 10% above for Q3, the analysts noted, driven by North America Retail profitability and accelerating growth in Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nApple also holds a \"Positive\" near-term outlook. For the first time in over a year, Morgan Stanley sees a favorable setup, expecting Apple to post better-than-expected results.\n\"Street estimates are 4-5% too low for the September quarter,\" the analysts stated. They forecast Apple will achieve $96.9 billion in revenue for the September quarter, which is 4% above the consensus. Driving this optimism are strong iPhone builds, improvements in the Mac outlook, and robust growth in Services.\nEli Lilly is another key player with a positive outlook. Morgan Stanley anticipates that upcoming data from the Phase 3 SUMMIT trial of Tirzepatide/Zepbound in patients with obesity and heart failure will be a catalyst for the stock. The data, expected in Q3, could demonstrate significant benefits beyond weight loss, potentially broadening Medicare coverage and strengthening Tirzepatide's competitive profile.\nThe analysts noted, \"We would expect positive data from SUMMIT (a statistically significant benefit on CV outcomes) to move LLY shares up ~2-3%.\"\nOverall, Morgan Stanley's analysts are keen to see how companies manage margins in a challenging pricing environment and whether high expectations for the second half of 2024 will hold.\nThey also highlighted that earnings revisions for the S&P 500 have been less negative than average heading into the reporting season, suggesting cautious optimism for the broader market.\nRelated Articles\nAmazon, Apple, Eli Lilly: Here's Morgan Stanley's earnings playbook\nAbbott posts Q2 earnings beat, lifts full-year outlook\nCiti sees further S&P 500 upside during 2H24\n"

        "Title": "Amazon is losing billions of dollars on Alexa and Echo. Here\u2019s 3 ways it can turn things around.",
        "Author": "  Mike Prospero ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nLast week, a Wall Street Journal article detailed how Amazon is losing billions on its line of Alexa-powered smart speakers, because it sold the devices at a loss, but never recouped the money because all of those Echos are being used as glorified egg timers.\nAmazon vastly overestimated the Downstream Impact (DSI) of Alexa. The company anticipated that consumers would use Alexa to order products and services through the smart speakers, which would make up the difference between the cost of Echo speakers and the price at which they were sold.\nAs a result, Amazon has severely cut back its Amazon devices division, laying off several thousand employees and killing off a number of products, such as the Halo fitness band and Amazon Glow.\nBut the losses have continued. Having used Echo devices and related products since Alexa was first introduced, I have three thoughts on how Amazon could turn around its business.\nThere are currently more than 500 million Alexa devices in the world, so Amazon has definitely achieved its aim of saturating the market. You\u2019re far more likely to see an Echo or an Echo Dot than you are a Google Nest Mini, as Google hasn\u2019t been as bullish as Amazon at releasing new smart speakers each year.\nNow that Amazon devices are so pervasive, there\u2019s less of a need to mark them down so aggressively to saturate the market, especially when your main rival is so far behind. However, it still makes sense to bundle them with products from Amazon that are profitable - like Ring video doorbells.\nAnd, like Ring devices, Amazon should make some features of future Echo speakers available only via a subscription. Consumers will hate it, but if the fee is nominal enough, they\u2019ll probably pay for it.\nThe nuclear option, as Avi Greengart explained on Techsponential, \u201cis that Amazon could insert ads into every interaction, weather the inevitable consumer backlash, and see how many people keep their Echos plugged in anyway.\u201d\nAmazon\u2019s hope when it launched the Echo was that people would use its smart speakers to order more products by voice, which would help justify the lower price of the devices themselves. However, it\u2019s just not proved a very popular method.\nBut, instead of reducing the price of the speakers, Amazon should instead reduce the price of what you buy via voice. It would still be losing money, but it would at least get consumers into the habit of ordering products with Alexa, rather than through the Amazon app.\nIf I could order toilet paper and batteries cheaper through Alexa, then I might be inclined to see what else I could get at a discount. And chances are, the discounts that Amazon offers here could be less costly than selling Echo devices at a loss.\nThis one is already in the works, as Amazon previewed Alexa Enhanced last fall. Not to besmirch all the work that people have done on it and other smart assistants, but the advent of OpenAI ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence has shown Alexa to be pretty dumb. I can\u2019t think of a single suggestion it\u2019s given me \u2014 outside a random Dad joke \u2014 that I\u2019ve wanted to hear. It\u2019s why I, like many others, only use it to set timers, turn on my smart lights, and play music.\nWhen I saw a preview of the new Alexa, it indeed seemed a lot smarter and more natural. However, people have become so accustomed to using Alexa and other smart assistants for such limited purposes that you have to get them adjusted to a new habit, and making them pay for Alexa Enhanced isn\u2019t going to cut it. You have to give them a reason.\nIf Alexa were to say to me \u201cby the way, those paper towels you always buy are currently 20% off - would you like to order some?\u201d then I would be a lot more likely to ask it to order something for me.\nUntil then, I\u2019ll probably just continue to use Alexa to let me know when my hard-boiled eggs are ready.\nBest smart speakers\nBest Alexa skills\nBest smart displays\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 5, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, and Nvidia NVDA.\nUS stock indexes have staged yet another bullish breakout. The economy is steady, employment is robust, inflation continues to fall, and stocks are making record highs \u2013 if you aren\u2019t bullish now, I don\u2019t know what else to tell you.\nLife can be very easy in this market, as some of the largest and most prevalent companies in the world are still trading at appealing levels.\nThe 'Magnificent 7' continues to grow earnings at an incredible pace, while the stocks also show encouraging momentum. Q2 earnings for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 companies are expected to be up +25.5% from the same period last year on +13.1% higher revenues, while the stock prices on several of them push YTD highs.\nMy favorite names from the Mag 7 currently are Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet. Also, Nvidia, gets an honorable mention because it too is still a fantastic stock with a top Zacks Rank.\nIn the chart below we can see that each of these stocks is showing significant relative strength against the broad market. Apple, although it trails the market YTD, shows the most significant short-term momentum, up 30% in just the last three months.\nApple, a consistently successful company with a strong stock performance, is one whose earnings trends I closely monitor. However, over the past two years, earnings revisions have been flat, and while it remains a decent performer, it hasn't delivered any exceptional growth.\nNotably, Apple\u2019s earnings revision trend has begun to turn higher for the first time in a while. This is extremely encouraging action, and Apple now enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\nAmazon too has seen its earnings revision trend turn higher, giving it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating as well.\nApple, Amazon, and Alphabet all have massive tailwinds coming from the AI boom. We learned about Apple\u2019s new AI software integrations, as well as Alphabets new AI agents over the last couple of months, but there are numerous other ways the technology is being used behind the scenes as well.\nAt Amazon, its web services business is going to be a huge beneficiary as technology companies ramp up computing power. But AI will also be used at its fulfillment operations, as the massive scale benefits from optimizations. Amazon is also quietly one of the biggest users of new robotics tech, as its operations continue to be automated.\nBased on these developments it\u2019s no surprise we are beginning to see analysts raise earnings estimates.\nAlthough Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting a flat earnings revision trend, it still has a lot going for it. It is currently the relatively cheapest stock in the group.\nToday, it has a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.4x, which is just above the market average, and below its 10-year median of 26.1x. GOOGL is also expected to grow its EPS 17.5% annually over the next 3-5 years, plans to buy back some $70 billion in shares this year, and is now paying a tidy 0.43% dividend.\nAmazon too is trading at a deep historical discount. At 43x forward earnings it is well below its 10-year median of 98.2x, and EPS is forecast to grow 29.6% annually over the next 3-5 years.\nAt 33.4x, Apple is the only one trading above its historical median valuation, but for a company of its quality it is no surprise it earns a premium valuation.\nThis bull market continues to charge, fueled by a robust economy, falling inflation, and stellar earnings growth from industry leaders. The \"Magnificent 7\" stands out with their impressive earnings and momentum, offering attractive entry points for investors seeking exposure to top performers.\nMoreover, the growing adoption of AI across these companies, particularly in areas like automation and cloud computing, positions them for long-term dominance in the evolving technological landscape. With valuations remaining reasonable and fundamental strength unwavering, this market rally appears poised to extend its winning streak.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "1 Phenomenal Stock That Could Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are having a dramatic impact on the technology landscape, which is evident in the market value of some of the world's most technologically advanced businesses. What many of these companies have in common is that they're trailblazers in AI.\nApple is currently the leader (as of this writing), with Microsoft currently at No. 2, with market caps of $3.4 trillion and $3.3 trillion, respectively. Nvidia's ascent has been breathtaking, adding nearly $2 trillion in value over the past year and climbing to $2.9 trillion to take the No. 3 spot. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- all at the forefront of the AI revolution -- boast market caps of $2.2 trillion, $1.9 trillion, and $1.2 trillion, respectively.\nWith a market cap of just $387 billion, it might seem like a longshot to suggest that Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) might be in the running for membership in the $1 trillion club. However, an examination of the company's recent results and commentary from management suggests the adoption of generative AI could push the company to new heights over the next few years.\nOracle is in an enviable place in the AI revolution. It offers cloud, database, and enterprise-software solutions that are relied upon by 98% of the global Fortune 500 companies. Oracle's information technology (IT) expertise makes it one of the go-to sources for enterprises looking to adopt generative AI solutions.\nThis has helped fuel solid overall growth. During Oracle's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended May 31), revenue of $14.3 billion grew 3% year over year, while operating income jumped 15% -- but that doesn't tell the whole story.\nDuring the Q4 earnings call, Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison noted that the company had inked more than 30 AI-centric contracts worth more than $12 billion in the most recent quarter alone. This included some of the largest contracts in Oracle's history. Ellison said he expects robust demand for generative AI to \"turbocharge\" the company's cloud database growth.\nThis, in turn, pushed the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contracts not yet recognized as revenue -- to $98 billion, up 44% year over year. When RPO is growing faster than revenue, this suggests sales growth is accelerating. This helps to illustrate that Oracle is capitalizing on the growing demand for AI among its sizable customer base.\nOracle's long track record of cloud and AI experience has many new and existing enterprise clients jumping on the generative AI bandwagon, looking to benefit from the increased productivity resulting from AI adoption. That said, fortune favors the patient, as this process will take some time to come to fruition.\nAccording to Wall Street, Oracle is expected to generate revenue of $57.9 billion in its fiscal 2025 (which began June 1), giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 7. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Oracle would need to grow its revenue to approximately $148 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nRevenue grew by 11% year over year in the most recent quarter and is expected to accelerate to 15% for the fiscal year. If the company achieves 11% sales growth, Oracle could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2034. However, if the company can maintain a growth rate of 15%, it would knock a couple of years off that timeline, reaching a $1 trillion market cap by 2032.\nThat said, estimates regarding the impact of generative AI adoption continue to ratchet higher. Conservative estimates suggest the market could grow to between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\nIf Oracle continues to successfully tap into this AI opportunity and proceeds along its current growth trajectory, the company could achieve a $1 trillion market cap sooner than many expect.\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $700,076!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Amazon MGM Studios has entered a multi-year film partnership with Scott Stuber, the former longtime head of films at Netflix, to finance and release movies from his new production company, it said on Friday.\nStuber, who left Netflix in March to start his media company, will produce several films annually under United Artists (UA), a relaunched label that once operated under MGM. The films will be released both theatrically and on Prime Video.\nThe agreement with Stuber, who will be involved in all projects released by UA, includes a first-look deal and gives his company a base at Amazon MGM Studios' Culver City lot.\nUA was first launched by Charlie Chaplin, among others, in 1919 as a production and distribution company and was acquired by MGM in 1981.\nAmazon bought MGM, or Metro Goldwyn Mayer, the fabled U.S. movie studio home to the James Bond franchise, for $8.45 billion in 2021, giving it a huge library of films and TV shows and ramping up competition with streaming rivals Netflix and Disney+.\n(Reporting by Juby Babu in Mexico City; Editing by Shreya Biswas)\n"

The deal will extend for 11 seasons, the report said, citing executives with direct knowledge of the deals. The new agreement, which is more than three times the current deal, comes as sports become a powerful draw for media companies trying to expand premium viewership.\nNBA has always been a star-driven sport with talents such as Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Shaquille O'Neal dominating the games and viewership. Disney's ESPN and ABC, and Warner Bros Discovery's TNT sports have been the league's two primary partners from 2002 and 1984, respectively. But media reports have said the NBA has been looking to bring in new partners to maximize returns and more than double the deal value.\nIf the deal goes through, it could end a 40-year-long partnership with Warner's networks.\nHowever, TNT could still match the deal, the Athletic report added.\nWarner will have the NBA next year as well since the new rights deal doesn't kick in until the end of the 2024-25 season. ESPN declined to comment while NBC, Amazon and NBA did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comments.\nThe league's governors are expected to formally approve the agreements with ESPN, NBCUniversal and Amazon, after which the NBA will send the finished contracts to TNT Sports, the report said.\n(Reporting by Priyanka.G and Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel, Shailesh Kuber and Alan Barona)\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 30, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL.\nGet ready for some action this week in the stock market as four of the Magnificent 7 tech giants \u2014 Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple \u2014gear up to report their quarterly earnings.\nThese tech titans have been the primary drivers of this year\u2019s return, pushing the market to new heights. But with the recent bout of market volatility, the big question remains: Is now the time for investors to dive into tech stocks?\nHere, we will explore the broader picture of the sector and potential outcomes of these quarterly earnings reports and try to figure out if any or all of them are worthy additions to investor portfolios at current levels.\nLast week, following the quarterly report from Alphabet, investors started to grow cautious. Concerns about overinvestment into AI infrastructure and its ability to generate profits moving forward have been the main cause of selling over the last week.\nManagement\u2019s comments about Capex regarding AI will be an important talking point for all these stocks.\nAlong with weakness in Alphabet, Semiconductor stocks and the other Mag 7 stocks have experienced considerable selling. But are these concerns overblown? I think they may be, and with another quarter of impressive growth likely coming, and reasonable valuations from the group, this dip could be a buying opportunity.\nAmazon is expected to post a 63.64% year-over-year increase in earnings to $0.54 per share, with revenue projected at $140.88 billion, driven by robust AWS and North American retail operations. Apple, despite a slight revenue dip to $81.64 billion, is forecasted to achieve earnings of $1.19 per share, bolstered by its services and wearables segments.\nMeta Platforms anticipates a significant earnings jump to $3.04 per share, a 45% jump and $31.05 billion in revenue, fueled by strong ad revenue and user engagement. Microsoft is projected to deliver $2.72 per share in earnings and $62.03 billion in revenue, reflecting Azure's impressive performance and continued strength in Office and LinkedIn.\nOverall, the Mag 7 is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\nLooking at the valuations of these tech giants we see a spectrum of results. Although they are broadly trading at reasonable levels, two of them look much more appealing than the others.\nMeta Platforms stands out with a free cash flow (FCF) yield of 4.1%, above its 10-year median of 3.2%, making it particularly attractive. Amazon too boasts an FCF yield of 2.6%, above its 10-year median of 1.8%.\nApple, on the other hand, has a FCF yield of 3%, which is below its 10-year median of 5.7%, indicating it may be pricier relative to its historical norm. And Microsoft shows a similar trend with an FCF yield of 2.2%, below its 10-year median of 3.6%.\nI think it may be a bit of a crapshoot buying these names ahead of earnings, but the reasonable valuations and secular tailwinds these companies enjoy make them compelling buys if they sell off further following the reports.\nCritical to the performance of these stocks through the end of the year is investors' perception of AI. Can these companies turn a profit in their new AI products? The answer is probably yes, but shareholders want to see hard evidence.\nAnother worthy consideration is the setup in the broader market and the approaching US Presidential Election. Big tech has been carrying the market higher all year, and it may be time for a pause in this run. Additionally, as the election approaches so does the perceived uncertainty, and investors may rotate into defensive sectors until after it concludes.\nHowever, it is hard to understate the long-term growth catalysts at these big tech companies \u2013 they are almost all expected to grow earnings faster than the market, which will drive even higher stock prices in the coming years.\nAny pause they take now, or in the coming months, is likely an opportunity to acquire shares in these generational assets.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Text": "The NBA has finalized contracts with NBC, Amazon and ABC/ESPN in 11-year agreements worth approximately $76 billion.\nThe pacts will now be sent to the league\u2019s governors for approval, which is expected to be a formality, according to the New York Times\u2019 Athletic, which first reported the news Wednesday. The board of governors are said to meet on Tuesday in Las Vegas.\nWarner Bros. Discovery\u2019s TNT Sports, which currently pays roughly $1.2 billion for NBA rights under the current contract that runs through the 2024-2025 season, will have five days to match after being sent the finalized contracts. If it declines, The Athletic reports that the new NBA deals could be announced as early as before the start of the Olympics on July 26.\nRepresentatives for TNT Sports, Amazon and ESPN declined to comment. Representatives for the NBA and NBC did not immediately return TheWrap\u2019s request.\nNBCUniversal is expected to pay the NBA an average of $2.5 billion a year to show around 100 games per season \u2013 half of which would air exclusively on Peacock, an individual familiar with the terms previously told TheWrap. The games would air on NBC on Tuesdays and Sundays to avoid conflicting with the network\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football.\u201d\nThe Wall Street Journal previously reported that Amazon would pay $1.8 billion for regular season and playoff games, the new NBA in-season tournament and \u201cplay-in\u201d games where teams compete for the final payoff spots. The tech giant is also reportedly being given a share of the conference finals, which it will split with NBC and ESPN.\nMeanwhile, Disney would pay about $2.6 billion per year to continue to air the NBA Finals, up from its current $1.5 billion. ESPN is expected to have around 80 games, down from around 100. During the NFL season, NBA games will air on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays, with Fridays being added in after the NFL season, according to the Athletic. Saturday games will air in a special window on ABC.\nThe post NBA Finalizes 11-Year, $76 Billion TV Contracts With NBC, Amazon and ESPN appeared first on TheWrap.\n"

        "Text": "Amazon makes shopping incredibly convenient, but not every purchase is a smart buy. In a recent interview, money expert and bestselling author Rachel Cruze spoke with lifestyle blogger Kallie Branciforte about products to avoid on the retail giant website. Learn More: Rachel Cruze: 3 Products That Aren\u2019t Worth the Money\nTry This: 7 Reasons You Should Consider a Financial Advisor \u2014 Even If You\u2019re Not Wealthy\nThrough her interview with Cruze, Branciforte talks about 5 types of Amazon items that you may want to think twice about adding to your cart.\nBranciforte warns about impulse buys of products priced very low on Amazon. \u201cWhenever you have to buy something that\u2019s five dollars or less, they\u2019re gonna make you buy it in bulk because they don\u2019t want to send you something for only five dollars,\u201d she explained. You can easily end up with far more than you need. She advised finding convenient household items in just the right quantities elsewhere when possible to avoid waste and clutter.\nAccording to Branciforte, children\u2019s electronic toys on Amazon often come with lots of extra parts and accessories. However, most kids only end up playing with one or two features. \u201cI always try to steer clear of that convenience,\u201d she said. \u201cAmazon is amazing, but it\u2019s not always great when we start to, like, fall into the convenience too much,\u201d said Branciforte about the temptation to overbuy. Consider checking toy store prices for simpler, better quality versions first.\nSmall countertop kitchen appliances can be a decent deal on Amazon. But for larger, more expensive machines, Branciforte suggests comparing against stores like Walmart, Target and Best Buy first. She cites an Amazon shopping hack to easily check prices across different websites before deciding where the best bargain lies.\nBoth experts warn about buying brand name cosmetics from Amazon resellers instead of directly from the brand\u2019s store page. Knockoffs with formula changes or inferior quality are common. \u201cI have friends who have like bought their favorite products and been like, \u201cWait \u2014 did they change the formula?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s because it was a knockoff,\u201d Branciforte said. She advised sticking to name-brand sellers, like Maybelline or L\u2019Oreal, to avoid makeup disasters.\nIn 2016, Apple actually sued Amazon over fake iPhone chargers being sold under the Apple brand. Branciforte echoes that Apple and Google products in particular may be better directly purchased rather than on Amazon. The competition from Amazon\u2019s own tablets and devices means more likelihood of encountering fraudulent listings.

Learn how to copy them.\nLike Amazon one year ago, Chevron is already a corporate giant and a heavy hitter on the S&P 500 \u2014 but Amazon gained 56% in the last year, and energy bulls expect a Trump victory in November could do the same for Big Oil.\n\u201cChevron is one of the largest American oil and gas producers,\u201d Termini said. \u201cFewer restrictions on drilling will definitely benefit this big oil company.\u201d\nMarket expert Gianmaria Feleppa, CEO of UCapital Fintech Group, agrees with Termini\u2019s sentiment about Trump\u2019s impact on fossil fuel stocks. However, he thinks ExxonMobil is the company that\u2019s most likely to have an Amazon-like year \u2014 after all, it has nearly double the market cap of Chevron.\n\u201cTrump recently met with oil executives and asked for $1 billion in campaign contributions,\u201d he said. \u201cIn return, he said he would roll back pollution regulations and would approve other policies they want while dismantling parts of President Biden\u2019s green agenda.\u201d\nTrump is not a fan of the green movement, but one sustainable energy company could profit from the trade wars the former president vows to expand if re-elected.\nTrending Now: Trump-Era Tax Cuts Are Expiring \u2014 How Changes Will Impact Retirees\n\u201cSolar panel manufacturer First Solar could benefit if Trump puts tariffs on Chinese-made solar panels, making them less competitive, which could help First Solar\u2019s sales,\u201d Feleppa said.\nDrill, baby, drill is not the only Trump philosophy that could elevate certain stocks. The former president is a longtime and ardent supporter of lowering corporate tax rates. The crowning achievement of his only term in office, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, did exactly that \u2014 and if a second term brings more of the same, Warren Buffett\u2019s investment firm stands to cash in as Amazon has in the last year.\n\u201cBerkshire Hathaway is one of the most profitable companies in America,\u201d Termini said. \u201cThe investment conglomerate run by Warren Buffet is likely to be a major beneficiary of lower tax rates.\u201d\nPresidents don\u2019t directly control interest rates, but as Termini said, Trump has indicated he will flex his executive power to steer them lower.\n\u201cAres Capital is a specialty finance company that provides financing to middle-market companies \u2014 a segment that large commercial banks have shied away from in recent years,\u201d Termini said. \u201cLower interest rates will mean more borrowing, which middle-market companies will likely pursue to accelerate growth.\u201d\nSelling at around $0.08 per share, Peninsula Energy trades over the counter as a penny stock, meaning it\u2019s much closer to Amazon in its embryonic stages. The company\u2019s Lance Project is one of America\u2019s largest U.S. uranium projects, and its stock soared by 10% in 2019 when President Trump announced a plan to create a reserve of domestically mined uranium for weapons and energy stored in a \u201cFederal Uranium Security Stockpile.\u201d\nMany analysts think a second Trump term could lead to more sunny days for Peninsula Energy for all the same reasons.\nTrump\u2019s Truth Social platform has endured bad press recently for stock volatility and financial losses. Similarly, Amazon lost 90% of its value at one point before bouncing back \u2014 and that\u2019s without Jeff Bezos ever becoming president.\n\u201cTrump Media & Technology Group, the company that holds Truth Social, Trump\u2019s social media platform, could get a boost if Trump uses the platform during his presidency,\u201d Feleppa said. \u201cIt would draw a lot of views from the U.S. and abroad tracking his messages.\u201d\nTrump has vowed to increase defense spending as part of a second term in office, and U.S. Global Investors think the stock is poised to soar if Trump is re-elected \u2014 it already secured a $499 million contract for anti-tamper technology for the Department of Defense.\nThe company, which Forbes calls one of the best midcap stocks of 2024, has a roughly $3 billion market cap. For context, Amazon had a $2 billion market cap at the start of 1998 and $10 billion before that year was up.\nThere are two reasons that analysts think a second Trump presidency could give Lockheed Martin an Amazon-esque year.\nFirst, it\u2019s one of the biggest defense contractors in the world, and Trump has vowed to increase military spending. But as financial and stock market news provider Finbold points out, the company provides drones and other essential technology for another one of Trump\u2019s policy priorities \u2014 border security.\nAxon Enterprise has a market cap of $21.5 billion, around where Amazon was in early 1999 \u2014 and InvestorPlace ranks it as the No. 1 stock to buy in anticipation of a second Trump term.\nThe company makes weapons, vehicles, systems and accessories for law enforcement, and Trump has vowed to increase police and domestic security funding as part of his law-and-order platform.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n9 Cars To Stay Away From In Retirement\n10 Top Items To Buy at Aldi with a $50 Grocery Budget\n5 Genius Things People With Healthy Savings Do\n5 Myths About Debt That Nobody Should Believe in 2024\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: If Trump Is Elected, Could These 10 Stocks Be the Next Amazon?\n"
