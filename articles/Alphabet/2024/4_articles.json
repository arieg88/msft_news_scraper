        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MA.\nAs of 2024-04-15, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $185.66. It's currently trading at a price of $157.77. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 15.02%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$5.94\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.57%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 21.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n102.56\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n106.93\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n185.66\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $166.94. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 5.49%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's no denying Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) potent position in tech. The company's $1.9 trillion market cap makes it the fourth most-valuable company in the world, illustrating the brand power of platforms like YouTube, Android, and Chrome, and the many services under Google. Time and time again, the stock has proved itself to be a valuable long-term holding.\nThe company's share price has soared 489% over the last decade, meaning a cash investment of $10,000 in 2014 would be worth nearly $59,000 today, considerably outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.\nBut is it still worth investing in Alphabet, or is it too late? Let's take a closer look at the business to determine if its stock is still a buy.\nAlphabet hit the jackpot when it launched its search engine Google in 1998, becoming a gateway to the internet for billions of users. And the company has done well to retain its market dominance, with an 82% share among search engines.\nThe success of Google has allowed Alphabet to branch out to other markets, including smartphone operating systems, online video sharing, cloud computing, productivity software, and more. But its smartest move has been leveraging the massive user base it has built with these services to become a digital advertising powerhouse.\nThe company is now home to nine platforms that each have more than 1 billion users, giving it nearly endless opportunities to sell ads.\nData from Statista shows the digital advertising market is projected to reach more than $740 billion this year, with spending expected to rise to $871 billion by 2027. And Alphabet holds a leading 26% market share in this sector, so it's prepared to continue serving this ad market and profit from its growth.\nSince 2019, annual revenue has risen 90%, while operating income increased by 135%. In that time, its free cash flow has climbed 151% to $69 billion. The chart below compares that last figure to those of some of its biggest rivals.\nThis impressive growth can largely be attributed to the success of Alphabet's digital ad business. And it could also suggest that the company is better equipped than its competitors to keep expanding and invest in budding technology like artificial intelligence (AI).\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market reached a valuation of close to $200 billion last year and is expanding at a pace to reach nearly $2 trillion by 2030. So it's a promising sign that Alphabet is focusing on monetizing this technology.\nThe company launched its most advanced AI model, Gemini, earlier this year. And it reportedly plans to consolidate its Deep Mind and its Research teams to further strengthen its AI capabilities.\nReuters said that Alphabet will move its Responsible AI teams, which focus on safe AI development, from Research to DeepMind to be closer to where AI models are built and scaled up.\nThere are multiple practical uses for the technology that could bolster its earnings in the coming years. For example, improving its AI capabilities could further secure the company's hold on the search engine market by creating a Google Search experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nAI could also enhance Google Cloud, make its ads more effective for marketers, and improve users' experience on YouTube with better video recommendations. If done right, Alphabet could elevate its entire business with AI, and boost its stock price over the long term.\nThis chart suggests Alphabet's stock is one of the best investments on the basis of value when compared to those three peers in big tech. It has the lowest forward price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash-flow, indicating its shares are a relative bargain.\nAlthough the stock has skyrocketed over the last decade, its potent position in tech and the emergence of AI suggest that it's not done yet. Alphabet is a screaming buy right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $466,882!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": "  Jeran Wittenstein, Ryan Vlastelica and Subrat Patnaik ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. is bringing in so much cash that hopes are rising it will take a page out of the Meta Platforms Inc. playbook and start paying a dividend.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUS Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing Hopes\nMalaysia in Talks With Tycoons on Casino to Revive $100 Billion Forest City\nBiden\u2019s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll Shows\nZuckerberg Asks for Patience as Meta\u2019s AI Push Spooks Market\nHow to Get a Meeting With the UAE\u2019s $1.5 Trillion Man\nThe search giant has been plowing excess cash into share buybacks for years and many investors expect another $70 billion to be earmarked when Alphabet reports earnings on April 25. But analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Truist Securities are among those that see a small dividend as a way to move the needle further for the stock, similar to Meta\u2019s February move that helped fuel a 20% jump in shares.\n\u201cA dividend would be well received,\u201d said Andrew Zamfotis, portfolio manager at Ami Asset Management Corp. \u201cWhile investors are still looking for growth from these companies, today there is also value in cost discipline and the decision to initiate a dividend suggests that management will be prudent and attempt to allocate capital in a way that balances growth and capital return.\u201d\nDividends have traditionally been seen as the province of more mature and slower-growing companies but the policy has been gaining popularity among tech firms. In addition to Meta, Salesforce Inc. and Booking Holdings Inc. have also initiated dividends in recent months. Among the six biggest US technology companies by market value, Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc. are the only ones that don\u2019t have a quarterly payout.\nAlphabet shares are up 10% this year, outperforming Microsoft Corp., as well as the Nasdaq 100. Rising optimism about its generative AI strategy has supported the stock of late, though it fell to a three-month low in March in the wake of a disappointing earnings report and fears that artificial intelligence tools could challenge its dominance in search advertising.\nWith Alphabet\u2019s revenue expected to rise 14% this year and cost cutting efforts supporting profitability, the company\u2019s free cash flow is projected to hit a record $83 billion in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Google parent also had more than $110 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2023.\n\u201cWe think Alphabet is likely to follow Meta\u2019s lead by introducing dividends this year,\u201d said Tejas Dessai, research analyst at Global X ETFs. \u201cGiven the favorable advertising market and recent cost-saving measures, now seems opportune for such a move, which has generally been positively received by investors.\u201d\nOf course, Alphabet faces other demands for its cash, such as adding AI computing capacity. The company had a record $32 billion in capital expenditures last year and that spending is expected to jump another 27% in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. However, the feeling on Wall Street is that Alphabet has plenty of cash for infrastructure spending as well as bigger capital returns.\nRather than seeing dividend initiations as a sign that the companies have fewer investment opportunities, market professionals are now viewing it as a sign of strength.\n\u201cFor corporations, sitting on cash in this environment is still suboptimal\u201d said Jenny Harrington, chief executive officer at Gilman Hill Asset Management. \u201cEven if they\u2019re getting 5% on cash, the credit they get for returning cash to shareholders through dividends, or the bump they get from buybacks, mean that those are better capital allocation decisions.\u201d\nTech Chart of the Day\nNvidia Corp shares plummeted 10% on Friday, their biggest one-day drop since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, and the stock closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since November. The slump erased nearly $212 billion off its market capitalization. The move came amid widespread tech selling, with AI companies seeing some of the most pronounced weakness. Shares edged higher on Monday, rising 2.8%.\nTop Tech Stories\nAfter years of working to assure the US government that its popular social media app isn\u2019t a threat to national security, TikTok\u2019s loss in that fight now seems almost inevitable.\nAustralia is gearing up for a showdown with Elon Musk and US social media giants over allegations they failed to move fast enough to police graphic content and misinformation during two violent attacks in Sydney over the past 10 days.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. options traders are contending with a rising wave of bearishness following the chipmaker\u2019s cautious guidance and concerns about whether the artificial-intelligence trade is unwinding.\nApple has long relied on China and the iPhone for growth. As those revenue sources continue to falter, the company must explore new regions and products to get back on track.\nUS Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Huawei Technologies Co.\u2019s latest phone shows that China remains behind on cutting-edge chip technology.\nEarnings Due Monday\nPremarket\nVerizon\nPostmarket\nCadence Design\nCalix\n(Updates to add stock move in Tech Chart of the Day section.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns\nCaught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides\nA Hedge Fund Billionaire\u2019s Cash Helped Fund a \u2018Predatory\u2019 Lender\nBig Junk Food\u2019s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner\nStudio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "The biggest driver of headlines across the technology sector over the past year or so has been the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's biggest companies see a vast opportunity resulting from AI and are investing accordingly to stake their claim in the AI revolution. What some investors weren't prepared for, however, is the level of spending necessary to reap the windfall that AI is expected to unleash over the next few years.\nWith that as a backdrop, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) slumped 3.4%, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was off 2.5%, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) fell 2.2%, as of 1:05 p.m. ET on Thursday.\nTo be clear, there was very little company-specific news driving these so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower today (more on that in a bit). This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to the quarterly results reported by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and what it means for other big players in the AI space.\nMeta Platforms released its first-quarter report after the market closed on Wednesday, and while the results were better than expected, there was one revelation that caught investors off guard.\nThe company reported revenue of $36.4 billion, up 27% year over year. Expenses advanced at a more modest pace, growing just 6%. This benefited operating margins, which surged to 38%, up from 25% in the year-ago quarter. This also helped expand Meta's profits, as earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71 soared 114%.\nThe results easily surpassed expectations, as analysts' consensus estimates forecast revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32. However, it was an update to the company's full-year spending plans that sent the stock reeling.\nLike its Magnificent Seven counterparts, Meta has been at the forefront of generative AI, eager to earn its part of the trillions of dollars the technology is expected to generate over the coming decade or so. However, \"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch,\" as the saying goes, and these systems are costly to develop. Not only is there the cost of the AI models themselves to consider, but the data center infrastructure necessary to maintain them.\nMeta has already created its large language model Meta AI (Llama) AI system, which is recognized as one of the top AI systems in the world -- but this is just the beginning. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted, \"We're investing and scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\nAs a result, Meta increased its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous expectations of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, \"We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.\" Meta also expects capital spending to be even higher in 2025 as it works to capture the AI opportunity.\nSo what does this have to do with Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet? The common thread that weaves these tech stalwarts together is their AI aspirations, and each of the three has also been spending heavily in order to reap the rewards of AI. Fair-weather investors took Meta's AI announcement as an indication that big tech's AI-induced spending spree will negatively impact results -- but we don't yet have evidence to suggest that's the case.\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their quarterly results after market close today, and Amazon is up next week, so some investors were selling preemptively in the event these stocks might sell off as well. Investors with a long-term outlook, however, will recognize that this is just the beginning of a multiyear profit opportunity, and volatility is the cost of admission.\nCompany-specific news for our trio of stocks was decidedly mixed:\nUBS analyst Stephen Ju maintained a buy rating on Amazon stock, but raised his price target to $215, which suggests 22% upside compared to Wednesday's closing price. The analyst sees potential for improvement in a broad cross-section of Amazon's business interests this year. This follows two price target increases by other analysts yesterday.\nChinese hackers accessed U.S. government emails last year, something Microsoft could have prevented, according to a report by the Cyber Safety Review Board. The company has lost face and is working to rebuild trust in its systems, according to numerous reports.\nThe potential for a TikTok ban, which was signed into law today by President Biden, could benefit Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, according to a report in The Washington Post.\nInvestors would do well to step back and look at the big picture when it comes to AI. Analysts at Goldman Sachs\u00a0Research suggest that as AI makes its way into business systems and the rest of society, it could generate as much as $7 trillion over the next 10 years. That's quite a windfall for the companies positioned to participate, which include Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms.\nWhen viewed in the context of this significant opportunity, their valuations are compelling. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are selling for 33 times, 23 times, and 22 times forward earnings, respectively, while Amazon is trading for roughly 2 times forward sales. Furthermore, all four stocks have easily outpaced the performance of the S&P 500 over the past five years.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all industry leaders on the cutting edge of AI.

GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with JNPR.\nFinancial Performance and Brand Dominance: Alphabet Inc's recent financial results underscore its robust market position. The company's revenue surged by over 15% year-over-year, with net income jumping by a remarkable 57%. This financial prowess is underpinned by its dominant brand and diverse portfolio of services, including Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud. Alphabet's ability to consistently generate substantial income from operations, which increased from $17,415 million to $25,472 million, reflects its operational efficiency and the enduring appeal of its advertising platform, which remains the cornerstone of its revenue stream.\nInnovation and Diversification: Alphabet Inc is not just resting on its laurels; the company is a beacon of innovation, particularly in AI and cloud computing. The 10-Q filing indicates a commitment to these areas, with expectations of increased capital expenditures to support growth, especially in AI products and services. This forward-thinking approach ensures Alphabet stays ahead in the technology race, diversifying its revenue streams beyond advertising and fortifying its long-term market position.\nDependence on Advertising Revenue: Despite its impressive financials, Alphabet Inc's heavy reliance on advertising dollars is a potential vulnerability. With over 85% of its revenue stemming from online ads, shifts in the advertising market or disruptions caused by ad-blocking technologies could significantly impact its bottom line. This dependence on a single revenue source, albeit a lucrative one, exposes Alphabet to market volatility and necessitates a strategic pivot towards more diversified income streams.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks: Alphabet Inc's filing acknowledges the heightened regulatory scrutiny it faces, with ongoing legal matters and the possibility of substantial fines and penalties. These challenges not only pose a financial risk but also threaten to disrupt business practices and affect the company's reputation. As Alphabet navigates a complex global regulatory landscape, it must allocate resources judiciously to manage these risks effectively.\nExpansion into Emerging Markets: Alphabet Inc's international performance is pivotal to its growth, with developing economies offering a vast untapped user base. As internet penetration deepens in these regions, Alphabet has the opportunity to capitalize on the growing demand for digital services, potentially leading to significant revenue expansion and diversification.\nStrategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: The company's robust balance sheet positions it well to pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships that can open new markets, enhance its product offerings, and consolidate its competitive edge. Alphabet's history of successful integrations, such as YouTube and Android, demonstrates its capability to leverage acquisitions for sustained growth and innovation.\nCompetitive Pressure: The technology sector is characterized by rapid innovation and fierce competition. Alphabet Inc faces threats from existing tech giants and emerging startups that challenge its market share in core areas like advertising, search, and cloud services. Staying ahead requires continuous investment in R&D and a keen eye for evolving consumer preferences and technological trends.\nGlobal Economic Uncertainty: Economic downturns and geopolitical tensions can lead to reduced advertising spending and consumer purchasing power, directly affecting Alphabet's revenue streams. The company's international operations also expose it to currency fluctuations and trade disputes, which can unpredictably impact financial performance.\nIn conclusion, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) presents a compelling case of a company with formidable strengths, including a solid financial foundation and a reputation for innovation. However, it must navigate the challenges of market dependence and regulatory pressures while seizing opportunities for international expansion and strategic acquisitions. The threats of competition and economic instability loom, but with prudent management and strategic foresight, Alphabet is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the digital age.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Alphabet stock was up roughly 10% during the session.\nRevenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, rose 16% from the same period last year to $67.59 billion, beating analyst expectations of $66.07 billion, per Bloomberg data. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.89 versus consensus estimates of $1.53.\nIn artificial intelligence, Google has widely been seen as playing catch up to Microsoft (MSFT), which was among the first in the tech world to reap the cultural excitement around consumer AI chatbots. Microsoft invested in OpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT.\nBut Google executives emphasized during the earnings call Thursday that the company is well positioned to lead the shift to an AI-centric tech world, and that it is committed to investments that will fuel the development of new models.\nPichai said the company has clear paths to monetize AI breakthroughs through advertising, cloud, and subscriptions.\nHe also touted the integration of AI tools into Google search, which allows users to ask more complex and descriptive questions.\nBut how AI will influence Google\u2019s search business remains unclear, since new AI-based interfaces might displace traditional search and change the way users interact with the Web.\nInvestors are also wary of the costs associated with AI versus the return. Alphabet's report arrived a day after its advertising rival and Big Tech peer Meta (META) noted that expenses for the year are growing and that it will take some time before AI investments generate significant revenue. The comments helped send Meta shares tumbling more than 10%.\nAlphabet reported capital expenditures for the quarter of $12 billion, mostly tied to servers and data centers. CFO Ruth Porat said during the call that the quarters ahead will register similar levels of spending, which reflects the company\u2019s confidence in its AI investments.\nFor the second straight quarter, cloud revenue rose nearly 30% from the year-earlier period to surpass $9 billion.\nGoogle has been working to claim additional share of the cloud market, where it currently sits in third place behind rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft.\nAd revenue, the heart of Google\u2019s business, rose by 13%, registering $61.66 billion.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

The company's financial details are available in its recent 8-K filing. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, continues to dominate the internet media landscape, with Google's services like Search, YouTube, and Cloud driving nearly 90% of its revenue, primarily through online advertising.\nFor Q1 2024, Alphabet reported revenues of $80.5 billion, a 15% increase from the previous year, surpassing the estimated $78.59 billion. This growth reflects strong performances across major segments, particularly in Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud.

Google Services saw an increase in revenue to $70.4 billion, driven by a surge in advertising and subscription revenues. Google Cloud continued its upward trajectory with revenues of $9.57 billion, emphasizing the growing demand for cloud solutions. The Other Bets segment, though smaller, also showed positive momentum, contributing $495 million.\nThe company's focus on efficient cost management and strategic investments in high-growth areas is evident from its reduced total costs and expenses, which stood at $55.07 billion, compared to the revenue growth rate.\nAlphabet's balance sheet remains robust, with total assets increasing to $407.35 billion as of March 31, 2024. The company's ability to generate free cash flow remains strong, facilitating strategic investments, shareholder returns, and further innovation.\nAs Alphabet continues to navigate the complexities of the global digital landscape, its emphasis on AI and cloud computing, along with prudent financial management, positions it well for sustainable long-term growth. The initiation of a dividend program and the aggressive share repurchase plan further testify to its solid market standing and optimistic outlook.\nInvestors and stakeholders are likely to keep a close watch on Alphabet's strategic decisions, particularly how it leverages its AI capabilities and expands its global product footprint, to drive future growth and profitability.\nFor more detailed financial information and future updates from Alphabet, stakeholders are encouraged to visit the investor relations website and follow official announcements and filings.\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Alphabet Inc for further details.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The recent jump in the share price has meant that the company is trading at close to its 52-week high. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s take a look at Alphabet\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n View our latest analysis for Alphabet \nGood news, investors! Alphabet is still a bargain right now. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $214.59, but it is currently trading at US$158 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Alphabet\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 48% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Alphabet. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? Since GOOGL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on GOOGL for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its buoyant future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy GOOGL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are. Luckily, you can check out what analysts are forecasting by clicking here.\nIf you are no longer interested in Alphabet, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

The company reported strong first-quarter results across the board, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nThe firm believes Alphabet \"is beginning to go on the offensive\" in artificial intelligence.\n\"The company is starting to bring AI responses into the main Search results page, and it is seeing an increase in Search engagement and satisfaction among AI users,\" he said.\n\"Management also expressed confidence that the shift to Generative AI in Search will expand the Search market opportunity, just as GOOGL saw with the shift to mobile & voice,\" the analyst added.\nAnmuth said he believes Alphabet has perhaps the most diversified AI monetization path among leading AI players, with AI revenue potential in ads across Search and YouTube, Cloud, and subscriptions via Google One.\n'\"Much like we saw with META the night before,\" he said, referring to Facebook parent Meta Platforms\u00a0 (META) , \"to support large AI ambitions, GOOGL will increase its capital expenditure spending this year, we believe to around $50 billion.\"\nBank of America Securities analysts highlighted Alphabet's \"rate triple-lindy returns,\" where YouTube, search, and cloud divisions beat Wall Street's expectations.\n\u00a0More Tech Stocks:\nCathie Wood buys $22 million of battered tech stock\nAnalyst revamps Nvidia price target as Mag 7 earnings loom\nAnalyst unveils new Amazon price target as stock tests $2 trillion\nThe analysts raised their price target for Alphabet to $200 from $173 and reiterated their buy rating.\n\"The quarter beat expectations across all major business lines, supporting a narrative change: Google is a beneficiary of AI,\" BofA said in a research note. \"Search is still not without disruption risk, but we remain constructive on Google infrastructure, data, and distribution advantages.\"\nNeedham raised the firm's price target on Alphabet to $210 from $160 and kept a buy rating on the shares.\nThe firm cited the company's \u201cstrong\u201d first-quarter revenue, operating income of $25.5 billion exceeding the firm's view by 16%, and the company's $70 billion buyback and initiation of dividend.\nNeedham added that YouTube would be worth nearly $400 billion if it were spun off or separately traded.\nTD Cowen analyst John Blackledge raised the firm's price target on Alphabet to $200 from $170 and kept a buy rating on the shares.\nBlackledge told investors that Search, YouTube, and Cloud revenue came in above estimates while also increasing as the company sees broad momentum and adoption of burgeoning AI services.\nOppenheimer boosted the firm's price target on Alphabet to $205 from $185 and kept an outperform rating on the shares.\nAlphabet's ad business is accelerating and driving operating leverage, despite significant investments in AI, the firm said.\nAll eyes are on Google I/O, the company's annual developer conference, scheduled for May 14, Oppenheimer said, and investors would likely be disappointed if the next-gen AI model isn't displayed at I/O.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 7.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share, indicating a change of +27.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.78 points to a change of +16.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.76 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $66 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $290.25 billion and $322.34 billion estimates indicate +13.2% and +11.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAlphabet reported revenues of $72.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.19%. The EPS surprise was +2.5%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Results: Alphabet Inc. Exceeded Expectations And The Consensus Has Updated Its Estimates",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) investors will be delighted, with the company turning in some strong numbers with its latest results. The company beat forecasts, with revenue of US$81b, some 2.3% above estimates, and statutory earnings per share (EPS) coming in at US$1.89, 25% ahead of expectations. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Alphabet from 44 analysts is for revenues of US$345.8b in 2024. If met, it would imply a decent 8.7% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to grow 13% to US$7.52. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$342.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.82 in 2024. There was no real change to the revenue estimates, but the analysts do seem more bullish on earnings, given the decent improvement in earnings per share expectations following these results.\nThe consensus price target rose 9.8% to US$183, suggesting that higher earnings estimates flow through to the stock's valuation as well. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. The most optimistic Alphabet analyst has a price target of US$220 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$143. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable.\nTaking a look at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can understand these forecasts is to see how they compare to both past performance and industry growth estimates. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that Alphabet's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2024 expected to display 12% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 17% over the past five years. Compare this to the 112 other companies in this industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenue at 9.8% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it looks like Alphabet is forecast to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.\nThe most important thing here is that the analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards Alphabet following these results. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. We note an upgrade to the price target, suggesting that the analysts believes the intrinsic value of the business is likely to improve over time.\nKeeping that in mind, we still think that the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for investors to consider. We have estimates - from multiple Alphabet analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here.\nWe also provide an overview of the Alphabet Board and CEO remuneration and length of tenure at the company, and whether insiders have been buying the stock,  here.\nHave feedback on this article?

Both its advertising and cloud computing segments outperformed expectations. Total first-quarter revenue climbed 15% year over year to a record-breaking $80.5 billion.\nFirst-quarter Google advertising sales climbed 13% year over year, and this isn't the only sign that the cyclical ad industry is in an upswing. Total acquisition costs crept forward more slowly than sales, which allowed operating profit to soar 46% year over year to $25.5 billion.\nAlphabet employs about 10,000 fewer people than it did a year ago, but that didn't slow down its cloud computing business. Cloud sales rose 28% year over year to $9.6 billion. The cloud segment also reported a $900 million operating profit, which was a new record for the company.\nPatil's $225 price target for Alphabet seems reasonable. The stock is up sharply this year, but it's still trading for a sensible valuation of around 23 times forward-looking earnings expectations. Even if the stock doesn't reach its target in the next 12 months, long-term shareholders have an excellent chance to come out ahead over the long run.\nAlphabet recently declared a dividend and another $70 billion in stock buybacks. The quarterly payout of $0.20 per share translates to a minuscule yield of about 0.5%, but it's still a great sign of confidence from the company.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Using Too Much Debt?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nThe chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Alphabet had US$12.9b in debt in December 2023; about the same as the year before. But it also has US$110.9b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$98.0b net cash.\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Alphabet had liabilities of US$81.8b due within a year, and liabilities of US$37.2b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$110.9b in cash and US$48.0b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it can boast US$39.9b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nThis surplus suggests that Alphabet has a conservative balance sheet, and could probably eliminate its debt without much difficulty. Simply put, the fact that Alphabet has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.\nAnd we also note warmly that Alphabet grew its EBIT by 18% last year, making its debt load easier to handle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Alphabet's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. Alphabet may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, Alphabet recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 81% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Alphabet has US$98.0b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. The cherry on top was that in converted 81% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$69b. So is Alphabet's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Alphabet, you may well want to click here to check an interactive graph of its earnings per share history.\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Shaun Pruitt ",
        "Text": "Outside of Tesla TSLA\u00a0and Meta Platforms\u00a0META, investors are largely antcipating quarterly results from magnificent seven players Alphabet GOOGL\u00a0and Microsoft MSFT\u00a0this week as well.\nWith Alphabet and Microsoft\u2019s quarterly reports set for Thursday, April 25, let's see which big tech stock is more attractive at the moment. \u00a0\nQuarterly Expectations \nAlphabet\u2019s Q1 earnings are expected to increase 27% to $1.49 per share versus $1.17 a share in the comparative quarter. On the top line, the search engine leaders' Q1 sales are projected to be up 14% to $66.02 billion. Notably, Alphabet has surpassed earnings expectations for four straight quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 7.22%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs for Microsoft, the software titan has surpassed EPS estimates for six consecutive quarters and posted an average earnings surprise of 8.82% in its last four quarterly reports. Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share for its current fiscal third quarter which would reflect a 14% increase from a year ago. Plus, Microsoft\u2019s Q3 sales are projected to rise 15% to $60.63 billion.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPerformance & Valuation Comparison\nCorrelating with their expansive growth trajectories, Alphabet\u2019s stock has risen +13% year to date with Microsoft shares up +8% to both outperform the S&P 500\u2019s +5% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +4%. Even better, GOOGL and MSFT have now soared over +40% in the last year which has also topped the strong performances of the broader indexes.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAt their current levels, Alphabet is more appealing in terms of P/E valuation and trades at a 23X forward earnings multiple which is near the S&P 500\u2019s 20.9X with Microsoft at 34.5X. It\u2019s also noteworthy that GOOGL still trades at a discount to its decade-long median of 26.1X whereas MSFT trades above its median and closer to its high of 37.4X during this period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nOver the last 60 days, earnings estimate revisions for Q1 (Current Qtr) and Alphabet\u2019s FY24 have remained unchanged with FY25 EPS estimates slightly higher.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn contrast, earnings estimates for Microsoft\u2019s current quarer and FY24 have slightly decreased in the last two months while FY25 EPS estimates have remained unchanged.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTakeaway \nWhile both of these tech giants are expecting double-digit EPS growth in FY24 and FY25, Alphabet currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with Microsoft landing a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). \nThis is largely attributed to the trend of earnings estimate revisions which has remained favorable for Alphabet along with the company\u2019s P/E valuation whereas Microsoft trades at a bit of a premium to its big tech peer and FY24 EPS estimates have dipped.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Reported EPS is $1.89, expectations were $1.51.\nOperator: Welcome, everyone. Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJim Friedland: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai: Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. It was a great quarter led by a strong performance from Search, YouTube, and Cloud. Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and Search. Then I'll take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube, and beyond. Let's discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last six years, we've gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue. Of course, Search continues to power that, as you see in our Q1 results. But in addition, we expect YouTube overall and Cloud to exit 2024 at a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion.\nThis shows our track record of investing in and building successful new growing businesses. Now, let's look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are six points to make. One, research leadership. Two, infrastructure leadership. Three, innovation and search. Four, our global product footprint. Five, velocity in execution. Six, monetization paths. First, our foundation of research leadership. We've been an AI -first company since 2016, pioneering many of the modern breakthroughs that power AI progress for us and for the industry. Last week, we further consolidated teams that built AI models under Google DeepMind. This will help simplify development and establish a single access point for our product teams as they build generative AI applications with these models.\nThe teams are making rapid progress, developing Gemini and other models. In February, we rolled out Gemini 1.5 Pro, which shows dramatic performance enhancements across a number of dimensions. It includes a breakthrough in long context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large -scale foundation model yet. Combining this with Gemini's native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text code, and more, it's highly capable. We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of things. Beyond Gemini, we have built other useful models, including our Gemma open models, as well as imagine visual models and others. Second, infrastructure leadership. We have the best infrastructure for the AI era.\nBuilding world-leading infrastructure is in our DNA, starting in our earliest days when we had to design purpose-built hardware to power search. Our data centers are some of the most high-performing, secure, reliable, and efficient in the world. They've been purpose-built for training cutting-edge AI models and designed to achieve unprecedented improvements in efficiency. We have developed new AI models and algorithms that are more than 100 times more efficient than they were 18 months ago. Our custom TPUs, now in their fifth generation, are powering the next generation of ambitious AI projects. Gemini was trained on and is served using TPUs. We are committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure.\nYou can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures. This will fuel growth in cloud, help us push the frontiers of AI models, and enable innovation across our services, especially in Search. AI innovations and Search are the third and perhaps the most important point I want to make. We have been through technology shifts before, to the web, to mobile, and even to voice technology. Each shift expanded what people can do with Search and led to new growth. We are seeing a similar shift happening now with generative AI. For nearly a year, we have been experimenting with SGE and Search labs across a wide range of queries. And now we are starting to bring AI overviews to the main Search results page. We are being measured in how we do this, focusing on areas where gen AI can improve the Search experience, while also prioritizing traffic to websites and merchants.\nWe have already served billions of queries with our generative AI features. It's enabling people to access new information, to ask questions in new ways, and to ask more complex questions. Most notably, based on our testing, we are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in Search usage among people who use the new AI overviews as well as increased user satisfaction with the results. And with Circle to Search, people can now circle what they see on their Android screens, ask a question about an image, or object in a video, and get an AI overview with lens. Fourth, our global product footprint beyond Search. We have six products with more than 2 billion monthly users, including 3 billion Android devices. 15 products have 0.5 billion users, and we operate across 100 -plus countries.\nThis gives us a lot of opportunities to bring helpful Gen AI features and multimodal capabilities to people everywhere and improve their experiences. We have brought many new AI features to Pixel, Photos, Chrome, Messages, and more. We are also pleased with the progress we are seeing with Gemini and Gemini Advanced through the Gemini app on Android and the Google app on iOS. Fifth, improved velocity and execution. We've been really focused on simplifying our structures to help us move faster. In addition to bringing together our model building teams under Google DeepMind, we recently unified our ML infrastructure and ML developer teams to enable faster decisions, smarter compute allocation, and a better customer experience. Earlier this year, we brought our Search teams together under one leader.\nAnd last week, we took another step bringing together our platforms and devices teams. The new combined team will focus on delivering high quality products and experiences, bolstering the Android and Chrome ecosystems, and bringing our best innovations to partners faster. We also remain focused on long-term efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base. You can see the impact of this work reflected in our operating market. We continue to manage our headcount growth and align teams with our highest priority areas. This speeds up decision making, reduces layers, and enables us to invest in the right areas. Beyond our teams, we are very focused on our cost structures, procurement, and efficiency. And a number of technical breakthroughs are enhancing machine speed and efficiency, including the new family of Gemini models and a new generation of TPUs. For example, since introducing SGE about a year ago, machine costs associated with SGE responses have decreased 80% from when first introduced in labs driven by hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs.\nWe remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and cloud, as well as subscriptions. Philip will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers. And in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Okay, those are the six points. So now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past eight months.\nAt Google Cloud Next, more than 300 customers and partners spoke about their generative AI successes with Google Cloud, including global brands like Bayer, Cintas, Mercedes-Benz, Walmart, and many more. Our differentiation in Cloud begins with our AI Hypercomputer, which provides efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to train and serve models. Today, more than 60% of funded Gen AI startups and nearly 90% of Gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers. And customers like PayPal and Kakao Brain are choosing our infrastructure. We offer an industry-leading portfolio of NVIDIA GPUs along with our TPUs. This includes TPU v5p, which is now generally available, and NVIDIA's latest generation of Blackwell GPUs. We also announced Axion, our new Google design and ARM-based CPU.\nIn benchmark testing, it has performed up to 50% better than compatible x86-based systems. On top of our infrastructure, we offer more than 130 models, including our own models, open source models, and third-party models. We made Gemini 1.5 Pro available to customers, as well as Imagine 2.0 at Cloud Next. And we shared that more than one million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, Discover Financial has begun deploying Gen AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers. Customers can also now ground their Gen AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications.\nIn Workspace, we announced that organizations like Uber, Pepperdine University, and Penny Mac are using Gemini in Google Workspace, our AI-powered agent that's built right into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more. We also announced Google Vids, a new application to create stories in short video format. And we introduced Gemini for meetings and messaging and Gemini security for Workspace. Customers are choosing Workspace because they have deep trust in our powerful security and privacy features. Our Cloud business is now widely seen as the leader in cybersecurity. I saw this firsthand when I went to the Munich Security Conference in February. Cybersecurity analysts are using Gemini to help spot threats, summarize intelligence, and take action against attacks, helping companies like American Family Insurance aggregate and analyze security data in seconds instead of days.\nTurning next to YouTube, which continues to grow and lead in streaming. We announced that on average, viewers are watching over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TVs daily. AI experiments like Dream Screen will give anyone the ability to make AI-generated backgrounds for YouTube shots. And on subscriptions, which are increasingly important for YouTube, we announced that in Q1, YouTube surpassed 100 million music and premium subscribers globally, including trailers. And YouTube TV now has more than 8 million paid subscribers. Finally, in Other Bets, Waymo's fully autonomous service continues to grow ridership in San Francisco and Phoenix, with high customer satisfaction and we started offering paid rides in Los Angeles and testing rider-only trips in Austin.\nOverall, it was a great quarter and there's more to come. iOS is in less than three weeks, followed by Brand cast and Google Marketing Live. I want to thank our employees around the world who are at the heart of this progress and who continue to focus on building innovative products, helpful services, and new opportunities for businesses and partners around the world. Thank you. Philip?\nPhilipp Schindler: Thanks, Sundar. And hi, everyone. Google Services revenue of $70 billion were up 14% year-on -year. Search and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year, led again by solid growth in the retail vertical, with particular strength from APAC-based retailers, which began in the second quarter of 2023. YouTube ads revenues were up 21% year-on-year, driven by growth in both direct response and brand. Network revenues declined 1% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms, and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 18%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. Let's now talk about a few highlights from the quarter from a product innovation and advertising performance perspective. First, it bears repeating that AI innovation across our ads ecosystem is core to every aspect of our product portfolio, from targeting, bidding, creative, measurement, and across campaign types.\nWe've talked about how solutions like smart bidding use AI to predict future ad conversions and their value in helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand, and how products like Broad Match leverage LLMs to match ads to relevant searches and help advertisers respond to what millions of people are searching for. This is foundational. As advances accelerate in our underlying AI models, our ability to help businesses find users at speed and scale and drive ROI just keeps getting better. We're especially excited about the doors Gen AI's opening for creative capabilities, helping deliver on the premise of getting the right ad to the right user in the right moment. Look at Performance Max. In February, we rolled Gemini into P-Max.\nIt's helping curate and generate text and image assets so businesses can meet P-Max asset requirements instantly. This is available to all US advertisers and starting to roll out internationally in English and early results are encouraging. Advertisers using P-Max asset generation are 63% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. And those who improve their P-Max ad strength to excellent see 6% more conversions on average. We're also driving improved results for businesses opting into automatically created assets, which are supercharged with Gen AI. Those adopting ACA see an average 5% more conversions at a similar cost per conversion in Search and Performance Max campaigns. And then there's Demand Gen. Advertisers are loving its ability to engage new and existing customers and drive purchase consideration across our most immersive and visual touch points like YouTube, Shorts, Gmail, and Discover.\nHollywood Film and TV Studio Lionsgate partnered with Horizon Media to test what campaign type would deliver the most ticketing page views for its The Hunger Games, Ballad of Songbirds, and Snakes Film. Over a three week test, Demand Gen was significantly more efficient versus social benchmarks, with an 85% more efficient CPC and 96% more efficient cost per page view. Lionsgate has since rolled out Demand Gen for two new titles. We're also bringing new creative features to Demand Gen. Earlier this month, we announced new generative image tools to help advertisers create high quality assets in a few steps with a few simple prompts. This will be a win for up-leveling visual storytelling and testing creative concepts more efficiently. And then there's obviously Search generative experience, which Sundar talked about.\nI'll add that innovation in the user experience on Search has historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We saw this when we successfully navigated from desktop to mobile. We're continuing to experiment with new ad formats, including search and shopping ads alongside search results in SGE. And we shared in March how folks are finding ads either above or below the SGE results helpful. We're excited to have a solid baseline to keep innovating on and confident in the role SGE, including ads, will play in delighting users and expanding opportunities to meet user needs. Which brings me to Search and our strong performance in the first quarter. In Q1, retail was again a top contributor. Our focus remains on driving profitability and growth for retailers, helping them optimize digital performance for both online and offline, as well as innovate across our shopping and merchant experiences.\nHighlights include continued upsides for retailers, leading into agile budget and bidding strategies across Search, P-Max, or both. Take Home Goods retailer IKEA, who leaned into Google's store sales measurement to understand its total omnichannel revenue opportunity across Search. By measuring 2.3x more revenue and using value-based bidding solutions to bid to its omnichannel customers, IKEA drove a significant increase in Omni revenue in Q1 and is now scaling this strategy globally. We also expanded local inventory ads into 23 countries, helping drive shopper confidence and offline sales. Retailers can convert intent into action by showcasing in-store availability, pricing, pickup options, and more all in one ad format. Moving to YouTube.\nLast quarter, I went deep into our strategy. It all starts with creation, which drives viewership, which leads to monetization. A few updates to build on Sundar's remarks. First, creation, which is all about giving creators the tools to create amazing content, grow their audiences, and build their businesses. In 2023, more people created content on YouTube than ever before, and the number of channels uploading shorts year-on-year grew 50%. We also hit a new milestone with 3 million plus channels in our YouTube Partner Program. We recently shared that YPP has paid out more than any other creator monetization platform, including over 70 billion to creators, artists, and media companies over the last three years. From a viewer's perspective, watch time across YouTube continues to grow, with strength in both shorts and CTV.\nAccording to Nielsen, YouTube has been the leader in U.S. streaming watch time for the last 12 plus months. In the first quarter, living room benefited from a combination of strong watch time growth, innovation in the user and advertiser experience, and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Viewers are watching YouTube because they expect to access everything in one place across screens and formats, their favorite creators, live sports, breaking news, educational content, movies, music, and more. And advertisers continue to lean in to find audiences they can't find elsewhere. Which brings me to monetization. We're pleased with our Q1 performance across both our ad-supported and subscription offerings. Sundar covered subscription growth.\nOn the ads front, direct and brand were both strong this quarter. Shorts monetization continued to improve, with shorts ads now supported on mobile, tablet, living room, and desktop, and available to both performance and brand advertisers. In the U.S., the monetization rate of shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the past 12 months, including a 10-point sequential improvement in the first quarter alone. Just last week, we introduced new ways for brands to get the most out of their shorts ads with new lineups on YouTube Select, including sports, beauty, fashion and lifestyle, and entertainment. For YouTube advertisers, increasing brand lift is one of the core goals. In Q1, we saw strong traction from the introduction of a Pause Ads pilot on connected TVs, a new non-interruptive ad format that appears when users pause their organic content.\nInitial results show that Pause Ads are driving strong brand lift results and are commanding premium pricing from advertisers. Before I wrap, two quick highlights on how we're helping our partners transform and accelerate impact with the best across Google. Number one, to help McDonald's build the restaurant of the future, we're deepening our partnership across Cloud and Ads. Part of this includes them connecting Google Cloud's latest hardware and data technologies across restaurants globally and starting to apply Gen AI to enhance its customer and employee experiences. Number two, WPP. At Google Cloud Next, we announced a new collaboration that will redefine marketing through the integration of our Gemini models with WPP Open. WPP's AI-powered marketing operating system already used by more than 35,000 of its people and adopted by key clients, including the Coca -Cola company, L 'Oreal, and Nestle.\nWe're just getting started here and excited about the innovation this partnership will unlock. With that, a huge thank you to our customers and partners, many of whom we're excited to see at Google Marketing Live and Brand cast in just a few weeks. And a huge thank you, as always, to our incredible teams for their agility and hard work this quarter. Ruth, you're up.\nRuth Porat: Thank you, Philip. We are very pleased with our financial results for the first quarter, driven in particular by strength in Search and Cloud, as well as the ongoing efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $80.5 billion, up 15%, or up 16% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect the impact of the restructuring charges we took in the first quarter of 2023 of $2.6 billion, as well as the $716 million in employee severance and related charges in the first quarter of 2024.\nAs you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines and other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated headcount. To help with year-on-year comparisons, we included a table in our earnings release to adjust other cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, and operating margin to exclude the impact of severance and related office space charges in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2024. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.7 billion, up 10%. Other cost of revenues was $20.8 billion, up 10% on a reported basis, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube, given the very strong revenue growth in both subscription offerings and ad-supported content.\nOn an adjusted basis, other cost of revenues was up 13% year-on-year. Operating expenses were $21.4 billion, down 2% on a reported basis, primarily reflecting expense decreases in sales and marketing and G&A, offset by an increase in R&D. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses were up 5%, reflecting first in R&D an increase in compensation expense primarily for Google DeepMind and Cloud, and second in sales and marketing a slight increase year-on-year, reflecting increases in compensation expense primarily for Cloud sales. Operating income was $25.5 billion, up 46% on a reported basis, and our operating margin was 32%. On an adjusted basis, operating income was up 31%, and our operating margin was 33%.\nNet income was $23.7 billion, and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $16.8 billion in the first quarter and $69.1 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $108 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results, within Google services, revenues were $70.4 billion, up 14%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $46.2 billion in the quarter were up 14%. Let again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.1 billion were up 21%, driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 1%. Subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues were $8.7 billion, up 18%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues.\nTAC was $12.9 billion, up 10%. Google services operating income was $27.9 billion, up 28%, and the operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $9.6 billion for the quarter, up 28%, reflecting significant growth in GCP with an increasing contribution from AI and strong Google workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $900 million and an operating margin of 9%. As to our Other Bets for the first quarter, revenues were $495 million, benefiting from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. The operating loss was $1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google Services, first within advertising, we are very pleased with the momentum of our ads businesses.\nSearch had broad-based strength across verticals. In YouTube, we had acceleration and revenue growth driven by brand and direct response. Looking ahead, two points to call out. First, results in our advertising business in Q1 continued to reflect strength and spend from APAC-based retailers, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through Q1, which means we will begin lapping that impact in the second quarter. Second, the YouTube acceleration in revenue growth in Q1 reflects, in part, lapping the negative year-on-year growth we experienced in the first quarter of 2023. Turning to subscriptions, platforms, and devices, we continue to deliver significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line.\nThe sequential quarterly decline in year-on-year revenue growth for the line in Q1 versus Q4 reflects, in part, the fact that we had only one week of Sunday ticket subscription revenue in Q1 versus 14 weeks in Q4. Looking forward, we will anniversary last year's price increase in YouTube TV starting in May. With regard to platforms, we are pleased with the performance and play driven by an increase in buyers. With respect to Google Cloud, performance in Q1 reflects strong demand for our GCP infrastructure and solutions, as well as the contribution from our workspace productivity tools. The growth we are seeing across Cloud is underpinned by the benefit AI provides for our customers. We continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth.\nAs we look ahead, two points that will affect sequential year-on-year revenue growth comparisons across Alphabet. First, Q1 results reflect the benefit of leap year, which contributed slightly more than one point to our revenue growth rate at the consolidated level in the first quarter. Second, at current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind from foreign exchange in Q2 versus Q1. Turning to margins, our efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base are reflected in a 400 basis point expansion of our Alphabet operating margin year-on-year, excluding the impact of restructuring and severance charges in both periods. You can also see the impact in the quarter-on-quarter decline in headcount in Q1, which reflects both actions we have taken over the past few months and a much slower pace of hiring.\nAs we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in Cloud, Google DeepMind, and technical infrastructure. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. We believe these efforts will enable us to deliver full-year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $12 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers.\nThe significant year-on-year growth in CapEx in recent quarters reflects our confidence in the opportunities offered by AI across our business. Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 level, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. With regard to Other Bets, we similarly have work streams underway to enhance overall returns. Finally, as I trust you saw in the press release, we are very pleased to be adding a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to our capital return program, as well as a new $70 billion authorization and share repurchases. The core of our capital allocation framework remains the same, beginning with investing aggressively in our business, as you have heard us talk about today, given the extraordinary opportunities ahead.\nWe view the introduction of the dividend as further strengthening our overall capital return program.

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Q1 Release",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.49 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +27.4%.\nRevenues are expected to be $66 billion, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.04% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alphabet?\nFor Alphabet, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -2.26%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alphabet will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alphabet would post earnings of $1.60 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of +2.50%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nAlphabet doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "A recovery in the online advertising market has excited investors and pushed share prices of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) to new highs over the last year. The stock is up 42% over the last 12 months, and analysts at Stifel Financial still see more upside.\nThe investment bank maintained a buy rating on Alphabet shares but raised its price target from $154 to $174. That's an 11% upside over the next 12 months from the current share price.\nIn December, the tech giant launched its new Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) large language model, which will lay the foundation for new AI services across Google Search, YouTube, and other products over the next several years. Wall Street is largely bullish on Alphabet's prospects because of its massive cash resources, years of investment in AI technology, and the potential for AI-powered Search to attract more users -- and therefore, grow advertising revenue.\nHowever, new technologies could present new challenges for Alphabet. Microsoft's Bing beat Google to the punch last year by rolling out its own search features using generative AI. Competition concerns explain why Alphabet stock trades at a modest price-to-earnings ratio of 23 despite the company's history of double-digit percentage growth in revenue and profits.\nBut it won't be easy to bring down the search leader. Google Search attracts over 90% of online search traffic, according to Statista. Google Search converted this overwhelming dominance into $48 billion of revenue just in the fourth quarter, accounting for 55% of Alphabet's overall revenue.\nThe Wall Street consensus estimate pegs the company's earnings growth at 16% on an annualized basis over the long term. Stifel appears to be adjusting its price target in line with these expectations. Assuming the economy and advertising market continue to improve this year, Alphabet should report strong growth, providing the needed catalyst for the shares to reach the analyst's price target within the next year.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

It\u2019s also poised to hit its highest level on record and exceed $2 trillion in valuation.\nLike other Big Tech companies, Alphabet has been plowing money into developing artificial intelligence, a strategy that has helped drive demand for its cloud services, which saw revenue rise 28% in the first quarter. Google is a distant third in the cloud computing market, trailing Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., but the company\u2019s prowess in AI could help it close the gap.\n\u201cThe main thing is, we are really excited about the benefit from AI for our cloud customers,\u201d Chief Investment Officer Ruth Porat told journalists on a call. \u201cWe saw an increasing contribution from our AI solutions.\u201d The Google Cloud results \u201creally reflect broad strength across the industry,\u201d she added.\nGoogle has developed much of the underlying technology being used in the AI boom today, and has woven it into products from web search to its suite of enterprise software from Gmail to Google Docs.\nYet ever since OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was released in late 2022, Google has been battling the perception that it\u2019s lagging behind Microsoft and OpenAI in rolling out new generative AI tools. The arrival of popular chatbots such as ChatGPT \u2014 which answers questions in a conversational tone rather than providing lists of links to other websites \u2014 has posed a threat to Google\u2019s two-decade stranglehold on search. The company is struggling to compete in generative AI without cannibalizing its core profit machine.\nSearch advertising revenue rose 14% to $46.2 billion. That compared with the average estimate of $45 billion.\nGoogle has marshaled teams across the company to reassert its lead in AI, yet its early efforts have been marred by embarrassing blunders, including a scandal over how its AI model Gemini handled race that forced the company to suspend image generation of people.\nInvestors have shown they are excited about the prospects of AI but want tech companies to continue to focus on revenue and profit in the meantime. Meta Platforms Inc., which competes with Google in AI and also digital advertising, suffered its worst stock decline since October 2022 after reporting that it would spend billions of dollars more this year on AI efforts and projecting weaker revenue for the current quarter.\nRead more: Zuckerberg Asks for Patience as Meta\u2019s AI Push Spooks Market\nSearch advertising remains the engine of Google\u2019s very lucrative business, and the company is facing heightened competition there, too. Meta has been seeding AI tools throughout its advertising business and Snap Inc. has also undergone a total revamp of its ad business to improve ad targeting. The digital ad market is recovering from a post-pandemic slump, buoyed by the Olympics Games this summer, but Google is increasingly vying for those ad dollars with Meta and Snap.\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s core search business also did well, but its future is not assured,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \u201cA verdict is expected in the US DOJ\u2019s related antitrust trial in the coming quarter, and the incorporation of AI-generated components into Google\u2019s main search interface will arguably be the biggest change to the search advertising market since its inception.\u201d\nIf consumers gravitate from Google search to the new wave of chatbots, that could imperil the company\u2019s search advertising juggernaut, which is expected to generate nearly $200 billion in revenue this year and the bulk of Alphabet\u2019s profit.\nCloud has been a bright spot for Google, after it first became profitable early last year. Many young AI startups are founded by former Google employees, creating a strong pipeline of cloud clients.\nGoogle Cloud reported sales of $9.6 billion. The unit\u2019s profit was $900 million, well ahead of analysts\u2019 projections of $672.4 million.\nDespite the hard questions that AI raises for the search business, \u201cthere\u2019s no question, however, that Google\u2019s AI ventures are helping Cloud, which has been a consistent growth driver,\u201d Mitchell-Wolf said.\nYouTube, the wildly popular video site, reported $8.1 billion in revenue, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of $7.7 billion. The unit returned to form last quarter after a series of disappointing results that showed the toll of advertisers\u2019 pullback in spending.\n\u201cYouTube, in particular, seems to have benefited from live sports investments, ad blocking crackdowns, and improvements in Shorts monetization, resulting in its strongest growth rate in two years,\u201d Mitchell-Wolf said.\nAlphabet\u2019s Other Bets, an eclectic collection of nascent businesses including the self-driving car effort Waymo and the life sciences firm Verily, reported $495 million in revenue while losing $1 billion. Investors have closely scrutinized the unprofitable unit for years, and earlier this year the company\u2019s famed moonshot factory, X, shed dozens of jobs as it pivots to focus on spinning out companies.\nPorat, who was named Alphabet\u2019s president and CIO last year, is expected focus more on overseeing these investments after the company hires a new CFO to replace her in that role.\nTo free up resources to invest in artificial intelligence, Google has conducted rolling rounds of layoffs that have struck teams including hardware, engineering, and the moonshot lab X. Google reported a total of 180,895 employees, down from 190,711 in the year-ago quarter.\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n(Updates with unit metrics, comments from president and analyst.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nModi Is $20 Trillion Short on His Grand Plan for India\u2019s Economy\nWill GM Regret Kicking Apple CarPlay off the Dashboard?\nTesla Strike Has US Unions Taking Notes\nAI Is Helping Automate One of the World\u2019s Most Gruesome Jobs\nHow the TikTok Law Could Intensify the US-China Tech Spat\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +13.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 11.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.75 per share, indicating a change of +21.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.4% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.82 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +17.6%. This estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.85 indicates a change of +15.1% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.3%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $70.32 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.3%. The $294.33 billion and $327.98 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.8% and +11.4%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Shares of Alphabet\u00a0(NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\u00a0surged to new highs following its first-quarter earnings report. The company posted double-digit growth in revenue and earnings, driven by Search, YouTube, and Cloud. Alphabet also announced its first quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and a new $70 billion share repurchase plan.\nJPMorgan was one of several analysts raising their price targets. The firm upped its price target from $165 to $200 and kept an overweight (buy) rating on the shares. Alphabet's momentum, shareholder-friendly capital returns, and fair valuation could certainly justify new highs for the shares.\nAlphabet is proving it can invest in artificial intelligence (AI) and grow profits. The company rolled out the new Gemini 1.5 Pro version of its AI model in the quarter, while net income jumped 57% year over year to over $23 billion. Management is delivering on the bottom line even as it builds a world-class technology infrastructure for AI.\nJPMorgan analysts believe Alphabet might have the most diversified strategy for monetizing AI among the leading players. New AI features are benefiting Google's advertising and cloud businesses, but it also has over 100 million subscribers to Google One, which allows members to use Gemini AI in Gmail and other products. Monetizing AI across ads, cloud services, and subscriptions gives Alphabet multiple ways to profit and deliver returns to shareholders.\nEven after the post-earnings jump, the shares are still trading at an average forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.5.

        "Author": "  Anirban Sen and Milana Vinn ",
        "Text": "By Anirban Sen and Milana Vinn\n(Reuters) -Google parent Alphabet has been talking to its advisers about the possibility of making an offer for HubSpot, an online marketing software company with a market value of $35 billion, people familiar with the matter said.\nIf Alphabet moves ahead with a bid, it would be a rare example of a major technology company attempting a mega deal amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of the sector under U.S. President Joe Biden's administration.\nThe potential acquisition would be Alphabet's largest ever and allow it to put some of its cash pile, which reached $110.9 billion at the end of December, to work.\nAlphabet has met with Morgan Stanley investment bankers in recent days about a potential offer for HubSpot, the sources said. It has been discussing how much it should offer and whether antitrust regulators would clear such a tie-up, the sources added.\nAlphabet has not yet submitted an offer to HubSpot and there is no certainty it will do so, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations.\n\"As standard practice, HubSpot does not comment on rumors or speculation. We continue to focus on building a great business and serving our customers,\" a HubSpot spokesperson said.\nAlphabet and Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nHubSpot's shares rose 11% to $693 on the news on Thursday. Alphabet shares were down 1% at $153.34.\nHubSpot, which listed in the stock market in 2014, provides marketing software to companies that typically have up to 2,000 employees.\nIt generated $2.2 billion of revenue in 2023 and posted a net loss of $176.3 million. Despite this loss, investors are excited about the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company's growth prospects, driving up its shares 50% in the 12 months.\nA deal for HubSpot would expand Google's offerings in the booming market for customer relationship management (CRM) software, enabling it to tap a wider base of enterprise customers who spend on marketing and advertising.\nIt would also be a boon for Google's cloud computing business, which is seeking to narrow its competitive gap with rivals Microsoft and Amazon.com.\nGoogle may also be able to argue to antitrust regulators that the acquisition would bolster competition in the marketing and sales software sector, challenging the dominance of players such as Salesforce and Microsoft. Many of these companies are enhancing their offerings with artificial intelligence, a technology in which Google is also investing to get an edge.\nGoogle is facing several antitrust challenges, including a landmark lawsuit accusing it of abusing its position as online search leader.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai is looking for avenues to boost growth after the company disclosed in January that fourth-quarter advertising sales came in below expectations. Its Google search engine and YouTube video streaming service face increased competition for advertising budgets from other online platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Amazon.com.\nDealmaking in the broader technology sector is picking up. In January, design software company Synopsys agreed to buy smaller rival Ansys for about $35 billion. Hewlett Packard Enterprise struck a deal in January to buy networking gear maker Juniper Networks for $14 billion.\nTechnology accounted for the largest share of merger and acquisitions during the first quarter, jumping more than 42% year-on-year to about $154 billion, according to Dealogic.\n(Reporting by Anirban Sen and Milana Vinn in New York; Additional reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Nick Zieminski and Richard Chang)\n"

        "Title": "Could Alphabet Stock Help You Retire a Millionaire?",
        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet\u00a0(NASDAQ: GOOG)\u00a0(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has undoubtedly helped many of its early investors retire as millionaires.\nThe stock IPO'd at $85 in 2004, opened at $100, and closed its first day of trading at $100.34, so an ordinary investor could have easily bought the stock around $100 a share at the time of its debut. The company would later enact two stock splits, a nearly 2-to-1 split in March 2014 and a 20-to-1 split in July 2022. So if you bought what was then Google stock at $100 the first day it traded, you would have a split-adjusted cost basis of around $2.50 and a $20,000 investment would be worth close to $1.2 million today.\nAlphabet may not generate the same eye-popping returns it did in its first 20 years as a public company, but it still can be a core holding that can help you retire a millionaire.\nNot surprisingly, Alphabet is best known for its Google search engine. Google has become synonymous with search, leading to an estimated 90% global market share. Google is a cash cow for the company, with the search engine generating $175 billion in revenue in 2023, an increase of nearly 8% from 2022.\nThe solid revenue increase came despite 2023 being a relatively slow year for advertising growth as many advertisers were cautious with their ad budgets given uncertainties over the economy. However, search revenue often tends to be less economically sensitive compared to other types of advertising. The reason is that this type of advertising is performance-based and thus has a more measurable impact on sales.\nHowever, search isn't Alphabet's fastest-growing segment -- that title belongs to its cloud business, which grew its 2023 revenue by 26% to $33.1 billion. Google Cloud is a business with a lot of fixed costs in terms of data centers and engineering, so scale matters. The segment just turned profitable in 2023, but it is now set to grow its profitability at a quicker pace than revenue given the operating leverage in the business.\nAlphabet's other big business is YouTube, which generated $31.5 billion in revenue in 2023, up 8%. Like Google, it also gets much of its revenue from advertising. However, the company's YouTube Premium and Music services just surpassed 100 million subscribers. Both services offer ad-free content and contributed about $15 billion of YouTube's revenue.\nOne of the strengths of the YouTube video platform is that it does not have the upfront content costs of other video services, instead opting for a revenue-sharing model with content creators. This has helped the company avoid many of the profitability issues that have plagued other streaming services. The company is also looking to compete with TikTok through YouTube Short videos by incentivizing creators to use the platform. Monetization of YouTube Shorts is still early, but represents a large potential opportunity given the platform's over 2 billion monthly users.\nGiven its dominant position in search and strong cloud and YouTube businesses, Alphabet is trading at an inexpensive valuation despite trading near an all-time high. It trades at a forward P/E of about 22.5 times and an enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of just 12.5 times. The latter metric takes into consideration the company's large net cash position of $97.7 billion and removes any non-cash items. This alone makes the stock a buy.\nHowever, the big reason to own Alphabet over the long term, and why it could help you retire a millionaire, is its underrated position in artificial intelligence (AI). The company is currently seeing the most beneficial impact from AI in its cloud service business, where it has credited AI for helping it win and expand deals last quarter.\nHowever, there is some fear among investors that AI could disrupt Google's search dominance. So far there has been little indication of this happening. Traditional linked-based search results will likely continue to be the best way to serve users actively looking to buy a product or service. This represents only about 20% of searches done on Google, and it's the only time the company serves up ads. AI, meanwhile, could help the company profit from the 80% of searches for which it does not provide ads. For example, AI could provide Alphabet the opportunity to profit from questions answered using AI, either through brand advertising or a subscription service.\nThe landscape is evolving with AI, but companies will undoubtedly find new ways to profit from its uses and capabilities.

        "Text": "The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past year or so has given investors much to consider. Yet it's important to remember that, in most cases, AI is just one part of a much larger puzzle, with each piece contributing something to the overall picture.\nKeybanc analyst Justin Patterson raised his price target to $175 on Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) stock while reaffirming his overweight (buy) rating. Despite notching gains of 49% during the past 12 months, this suggests potential upside of roughly 14% over the coming year compared to Friday's closing price.\nThe analyst doesn't see much that will change Alphabet's positive investing thesis when the company reports its first-quarter results after market close on Thursday. That said, he believes there are plenty of potential catalysts that could propel the stock higher in the weeks and months to come.\nAlphabet has been working to achieve \"durable cost savings\" this year as it tries to reduce its spending. The company has already conducted several rounds of layoffs as part of its restructuring.\nEarlier this year, Meta Platforms joined the fraternity of technology companies paying a dividend, and some investors are watching carefully to see if Alphabet will follow suit. If the Google parent were to announce a payout, that could boost the stock price, as income investors rush to buy shares ahead of the first payout.\nOne issue that has been weighing on Alphabet stock is the uncertainty surrounding CFO Ruth Porat. Last year, Porat announced she would step down to take on the role of president and chief investment officer, though she plans to remain as CFO until a replacement is found. Wall Street dislikes uncertainty, so finding someone to fill the role would be a positive catalyst.\nFinally, at 27 times earnings, the stock is comparable to the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500, with greater upside potential.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this company have returned +13% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.6% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 13.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share, indicating a change of +27.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.77 points to a change of +16.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.75 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $65.95 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.6%. The $286.48 billion and $318.3 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.7% and +11.1%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAlphabet reported revenues of $72.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.14%. The EPS surprise was +2.5%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Following Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL\u00a0blowout first quarter results last week, and the announcement of its first-ever dividend, now appears to be a promising time to invest in the Magnificent Seven titan.\nTo that point, Alphabet\u2019s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and is the Bull of the Day as earnings estimate revisions have soared for the cloud and search engine provider.\u00a0\nStrong Performance Overview: Alphabet\u2019s strong Q1 results were attributed to Google Search, Cloud, and stronger advertising growth on YouTube. Alphabet also emphasized that it is well-positioned for the next wave of artificial intelligence through its platform Gemini which is a generative AI multimodal with understanding across audio, video, and text code.\nThis has now led to a +17% year-to-date surge in Alphabet\u2019s stock which has impressively topped the S&P 500\u2019s +8% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +4%. Furthermore, GOOGL has noticeably outperformed the broader indexes over the last year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSoaring EPS Estimates\nEarnings estimates for Alphabet\u2019s fiscal 2024 and FY25 have soared in the last week after the tech giant reported Q1 earnings of $1.89 per share which increased 61% year over year and crushed the Zacks Consensus of $1.49 a share by 27%.\nLargely attributing to Alphabet\u2019s strong buy rating is that FY24 earnings estimate revisions have risen 10% since the company\u2019s exhilarating Q1 report from estimates of $6.79 a share to $7.49 per share. Plus, FY25 EPS estimates are up 10% in that last week as well, rising from projections of $7.78 a share to $8.61 per share.\nAlphabet\u2019s annual earnings are now projected to rise 29% this year with another 15% EPS growth expected in FY25.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMagnificent Seven Value\nAdding value to shareholders and peaking their optimism, Alphabet announced a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share with the first payout set for June 17 to shareholders on record as of June 10. Notably, five of the Magnificent Seven stocks now offer dividends with Alphabet joining Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA, and Meta Platforms META\u00a0in this regard. \u00a0\nHowever, what also stands out about Alphabet is that outside of Meta Platforms, it is the most reasonably valued of the Mag Seven in terms of P/E valuation at 24.3X forward earnings and close to the S&P 500\u2019s 21.5X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nAlphabet continues to rightfully retain its title as a \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stock that has significantly boosted the market\u2019s returns in recent years and is one the most appealing technology-driven companies to invest in at the moment.\u00a0\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect the company to report earnings of $1.51 per share, on $78.7 billion in revenue.\nA year earlier, Alphabet earned $1.17 per share on revenue of $69.8 billion.\nBoris Streubel/Getty Images\nLast year, Google Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat announced that she would be stepping down from Alphabet's top finance chief role to eventually assume a dual role of chief investment officer and president.\nShe became Google's CFO in 2015 and oversaw the transition into the company\u2019s current Alphabet structure.\nRelated: Tesla crash continues as Musk doubles down on 'blindingly obvious' strategy\nMore recently,\u00a0Porat told the company\u2019s finance teams that their groups would see restructuring, including relocations and layoffs, CNBC reported last week.\n\u201cThe tech sector is in the midst of a tremendous platform shift with Al,\u201d Porat wrote in the memo, obtained by CNBC, sent to finance employees.\n\u201cAs a company, this means we have the opportunity to make more helpful products for billions of users and provide faster solutions to our customers, but it also means we collectively have to make tough decisions, including how and where we work to align with our highest priority areas,\u201d she said.\nThe restructuring will affect finance teams domestically and abroad, including in Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\nKeyBanc analysts noted Porat's career move when they raised their price target on Alphabet to $175 from $165 while keeping an overweight rating on shares.\nAlphabet has near-term catalysts forming from multiple events: operating expense discipline, the Waymo expansion, a potential dividend, and a new CFO, the firm said.\nIn contrast, the analysts noted that Facebook parent Meta Platforms\u00a0 (META) \u00a0\"having a wide revenue guidance range around unrest in the Middle East could alarm investors, particularly if the first quarter\u2019s outperformance moderates.\"\nMeta is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on April 24 and KeyBanc cut its price target on the social media titan to $555 from $575 while maintaining a buy rating.\nThe firm said that Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai's April 18 blog post entitled \"Building for our AI future\", signaled that the company is more focused on product velocity, and is taking actions to restructure divisions.\n\"We believe this is congruent with our view of layoffs persisting through 2Q and speaks to further operating income upside,\" Keybanc said.\nMore AI Stocks:\nAnalyst unveils eye-popping Palantir stock price target after Oracle deal\nVeteran analyst delivers blunt warning about Nvidia's stock\nAnalysts revamp Microsoft stock price target amid OpenAI reports\nThe analysts said Meta Platforms, an AI rival to Alphabet, continues to show progress with AI, from the expansion of Meta Assistant to the release of Llama 3, the latest iteration in Meta\u2019s series of large language models.\nDuring the company\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings call in January, Pichai told analysts that Alphabet has \u201cled the way in using AI to improve many of our products from search to ads to most of our consumer and enterprise products, helping billions of people already.\u201d\n\"We closed the year by launching the Gemini era, a new industry-leading series of models that will fuel the next generation of advances,\" he said. \"Gemini is the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind, bringing together our two world-class research teams.\"\nKeyBanc analysts believe Alphabet's capital expenditures could reach $42 billion this year and $46 billion in 2025 as it continues to invest in AI technical infrastructure.\nRegarding dividends, the analysts noted that Meta surprised investors by implementing a dividend policy during its fourth-quarter earnings call.\n\"Our sense is investors would like to see Alphabet follow Meta's lead as it represents a good use of cash and does not carry the headaches of M&A,\" KeyBanck said. \"While we believe the likelihood of a dividend has gone up, we believe it's hard to predict whether Alphabet will pursue this before or after a new CEO is chosen.\"\nOn April 17, Truist Securities analysts boosted their price target for Alphabet to $170 from $158 per share, while holding on to their buy rating.\nTruist said the adjustment reflected a positive outlook based on sustained user engagement and advertising revenue growth, particularly in Search and Social platforms.\nThe firm anticipates that Alphabet's first-quarter results will surpass consensus estimates, citing cost management as a key factor in driving year-over-year margin improvement.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you evaluated the performance of Alphabet's (GOOGL) international operations for the quarter ending March 2024? Given the extensive global presence of this internet search leader, analyzing the patterns in international revenues is crucial for understanding its financial strength and potential for growth.\nIn the modern, closely-knit global economic landscape, the capacity of a business to access foreign markets is often a key determinant of its financial well-being and growth path. Investors now place great importance on grasping the extent of a company's dependence on international markets, as it sheds light on the firm's earnings stability, its skill in leveraging various economic cycles and its broad growth potential.\nBeing present in international markets serves as a counterbalance to domestic economic challenges while offering chances to engage with more rapidly evolving economies. However, this kind of diversification introduces challenges like currency fluctuations, geopolitical uncertainties and varying market trends.\nUpon examining GOOGL's recent quarterly performance, we noticed several interesting patterns in the revenue generated from its international segments, which are commonly analyzed and observed by Wall Street experts.\nFor the quarter, the company's total revenue amounted to $67.59 billion, experiencing an increase of 16.4% year over year. Next, we'll explore the breakdown of GOOGL's international revenue to understand the importance of its overseas business operations.\nUnveiling Trends in GOOGL's International Revenues\nDuring the quarter, APAC contributed $13.29 billion in revenue, making up 19.7% of the total revenue. When compared to the consensus estimate of $13.46 billion, this meant a surprise of -1.3%. Looking back, APAC contributed $13.98 billion, or 19.3%, in the previous quarter, and $11.68 billion, or 20.1%, in the same quarter of the previous year.\nOf the total revenue, $23.79 billion came from EMEA during the last fiscal quarter, accounting for 35.2%. This represented a surprise of +1.65% as analysts had expected the region to contribute $23.4 billion to the total revenue. In comparison, the region contributed $25.01 billion, or 34.6%, and $21.08 billion, or 36.3%, to total revenue in the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.\nOther Americas accounted for 6.9% of the company's total revenue during the quarter, translating to $4.65 billion. Revenues from this region represented a surprise of +3.99%, with Wall Street analysts collectively expecting $4.47 billion. When compared to the preceding quarter and the same quarter in the previous year, Other Americas contributed $5.18 billion (7.2%) and $4.08 billion (7%) to the total revenue, respectively.\nInternational Market Revenue Projections\nFor the current fiscal quarter, it is anticipated by Wall Street analysts that Alphabet will report a total revenue of $70.32 billion, which reflects an increase of 13.3% from the same quarter in the previous year. The revenue contributions are expected to be 19.1% from APAC ($13.41 billion), 32.8% from EMEA ($23.08 billion) and 11.4% from Other Americas ($8.02 billion).\nAnalysts expect the company to report a total annual revenue of $294.33 billion for the full year, marking an increase of 14.8% compared to last year. The expected revenue contributions from APAC, EMEA and Other Americas are projected to be 19.3% ($56.69 billion), 33.3% ($97.92 billion) and 8.9% ($26.15 billion) of the total revenue, in that order.\nWrapping Up\nRelying on international markets for revenues, Alphabet faces both prospects and perils. Thus, tracking the company's international revenue trends is essential for accurately projecting its future trajectory.\nWith the increasing intricacies of global interdependence and geopolitical strife, Wall Street analysts meticulously observe these patterns, especially for companies with an international footprint, to tweak their forecasts of earnings. Importantly, several additional factors, such as a company's domestic market status, also impact these earnings forecasts.\nAt Zacks, we place significant importance on a company's evolving earnings outlook. This is based on empirical evidence demonstrating its strong influence on a stock's short -term price movements. Invariably, there exists a positive relationship -- an upward revision in earnings estimates is typically mirrored by a rise in the stock price.\nOur proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, with its externally validated exceptional track record, harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions to serve as a dependable measure for anticipating the short-term price trends of stocks.\nCurrently, Alphabet holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), signifying its potential to match the overall market's performance in the forthcoming period.

        "Title": "Alphabet, Microsoft earnings show hefty AI bets are driving growth",
        "Author": "  Aditya Soni ",
        "Text": "By Aditya Soni\n(Reuters) -Alphabet and Microsoft ignited a rally in technology stocks on Friday with earnings that showed big AI investments were driving growth, allaying doubts that their costly bets would take time to pay off after a soft forecast from Meta Platforms.\nAlphabet surged 10% and closed with a stock market value above $2 trillion for the first time, according to LSEG data, after the company sweetened the pot for investors with its maiden dividend and a $70 billion stock buyback.\nThe world's fourth most valuable firm flirted with the milestone on an intraday basis over three years ago, according to LSEG Datastream.\nMicrosoft gained nearly 2% and added about $54 billion to its market value.\nAfter pouring billions of dollars into the infrastructure needed to support AI applications, both Alphabet and Microsoft reported that their quarterly revenue growth was outpacing expectations as more users turn to services including the Copilot AI assistant and the Gemini chatbot.\nAI services accounted for 7 percentage points of the 31% jump in revenue at Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing platform between January and March, finance chief Amy Hood said.\nShe added near-term AI demand was a bit higher than the company's capacity, which held back growth in the quarter and highlighted the need for spending to expand its infrastructure.\nAt Google, cloud revenue jumped about 28% with strong growth in Google Workspace, where the Alphabet unit offers a slew of AI features powered by its large language model Gemini.\nThe results contrasted with a warning of higher spending and softer-than-expected growth from social media giant Meta, whose stock tumbled 10% on Thursday.\n\"This quarter illustrated how demand remains high for generative AI from Microsoft customers, and we continue to believe that Microsoft sits as a leader in this GenAI environment,\" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said.\n\"Meta is indicating the results of further increased investment may be years away while Microsoft and Google are showing them right now.\"\nThe results also sparked a rise of 3.4% in Amazon.com, which will report earnings on Tuesday.\n\"The three hyperscalers (major cloud companies) we've heard from thus far all highlighted a similar message on AI capital expenditure - this is an arms race, the AI opportunity is enormous, and spending will continue to be aggressive/ahead of market expectations,\" Bernstein analyst Michael Chiang said.\nMicrosoft's capital expenditures grew by $300 million from the previous quarter to $11.5 billion, while Alphabet's capital expenditures were $12 billion, a 91% jump from a year prior.\nAt least 28 analysts raised their price targets on Alphabet, pushing the median view to $190, compared with its last close of $156. Microsoft saw at least 25 price-target increases from analysts, with the median view on the stock now at $475.\nMicrosoft has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30.40, compared with Alphabet's 21.63.\nSome analysts believe the more premium valuation was justified. \"Google Cloud showed improvement but less than the growth of Azure. Azure's enterprise focus and their differentiated capabilities played a part and we (and the market) await Amazon Web Services results,\" Bernstein analysts said.\n(Reporting by Gokul Pisharody and Siddarth S in Bengaluru and Samuel Indyk in London; Additional reporting by Yuvraj Malik; Editing by Amanda Cooper, Savio D'Souza and Anil D'Silva)\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL is leaving no stone unturned to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the global digital wallet market on the back of new Google Wallet features. Per The Business Research Company report, the digital wallet market is expected to hit $47.7 billion in 2024 and reach $97.54 billion by 2033, witnessing a CAGR of 19.6% between 2024 and 2033.In this regard, the company recently unveiled a new \u201cAutomatically add linked passes\u201d feature to Google Wallet.This new feature is an addition to the \"Passes\" sub-section in Google Wallet settings on Android. It allows providers to automatically add event tickets, promotions and offers to existing passes.Further, the Auto Linked Passes feature also allows providers to send additional passes to users with existing passes in their Google Wallet and pre-link passes to primary passes.Alphabet is expected to gain solid traction across Android users on the back of its latest move.\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\nApart from the Auto Linked Passes feature, Google recently added a new \u201cVerification settings\u201d feature in Google Wallet for Android, enabling users to choose whether to verify their identity when using payment methods and passes.This new feature leads to a \"Transit payments\" option that enables user identity verification before paying with a credit or debit card.Alphabet also announced Google Wallet updates to support open-loop payment systems, providing a dedicated page for recent activity and ride history, showing saved fare caps, connected payment methods and network-specific offerings.Additionally, the company announced an update to its Wallet app for Wear OS, enabling users to access their loyalty cards.With the addition of the latest update, Google Wallet on Wear OS now supports all loyalty cards stored on phones or Google Accounts, appearing after payment methods. The users can tap on a QR or barcode to view details, scroll down for more information and use shortcuts like \u201cOpen on phone\u201d or \u201cDelete pass\u201d on their smartwatches.All the above-mentioned endeavors will further bolster its Android offerings. This, in turn, will boost its Google Services segment, which remains the key growth catalyst for the company. Its shares have gained 43.3% in the past year, compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 43.1%.The strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid its overall financial performance in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $290.4 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.2%.\nGrowing Google Wallet efforts will aid Alphabet to compete well with the likes of Microsoft MSFT and Apple AAPL, which are also making strong efforts to boost their presence in the booming digital wallet space.Microsoft\u2019s addition of a cryptocurrency wallet to its Edge Wallet remains noteworthy. This feature provides real-time updates on cryptocurrency value fluctuations and logging transactions for effective monitoring.Further, the Microsoft Wallet app securely saves card numbers with expiry dates and CVV codes, ensuring the protection of payment information for shopping or payment gateways.Apple, on the other hand, is enjoying the growing momentum of Apple Wallet with the addition of new features.Notably, Apple Pay orders can now be attached to receipts as PDF or image files, allowing customers to track payment in the Wallet app and to confirmation emails.\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is AMETEK AME, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

        "Title": "If You Invested $10,000 in Alphabet 10 Years Ago, This Is How Much You Would Have Today",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's no denying Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) potent position in tech. The company's $1.9 trillion market cap makes it the fourth most-valuable company in the world, illustrating the brand power of platforms like YouTube, Android, and Chrome, and the many services under Google. Time and time again, the stock has proved itself to be a valuable long-term holding.\nThe company's share price has soared 489% over the last decade, meaning a cash investment of $10,000 in 2014 would be worth nearly $59,000 today, considerably outperforming the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.\nBut is it still worth investing in Alphabet, or is it too late? Let's take a closer look at the business to determine if its stock is still a buy.\nAlphabet hit the jackpot when it launched its search engine Google in 1998, becoming a gateway to the internet for billions of users. And the company has done well to retain its market dominance, with an 82% share among search engines.\nThe success of Google has allowed Alphabet to branch out to other markets, including smartphone operating systems, online video sharing, cloud computing, productivity software, and more. But its smartest move has been leveraging the massive user base it has built with these services to become a digital advertising powerhouse.\nThe company is now home to nine platforms that each have more than 1 billion users, giving it nearly endless opportunities to sell ads.\nData from Statista shows the digital advertising market is projected to reach more than $740 billion this year, with spending expected to rise to $871 billion by 2027. And Alphabet holds a leading 26% market share in this sector, so it's prepared to continue serving this ad market and profit from its growth.\nSince 2019, annual revenue has risen 90%, while operating income increased by 135%. In that time, its free cash flow has climbed 151% to $69 billion. The chart below compares that last figure to those of some of its biggest rivals.\nThis impressive growth can largely be attributed to the success of Alphabet's digital ad business. And it could also suggest that the company is better equipped than its competitors to keep expanding and invest in budding technology like artificial intelligence (AI).\nAccording to Grand View Research, the AI market reached a valuation of close to $200 billion last year and is expanding at a pace to reach nearly $2 trillion by 2030. So it's a promising sign that Alphabet is focusing on monetizing this technology.\nThe company launched its most advanced AI model, Gemini, earlier this year. And it reportedly plans to consolidate its Deep Mind and its Research teams to further strengthen its AI capabilities.\nReuters said that Alphabet will move its Responsible AI teams, which focus on safe AI development, from Research to DeepMind to be closer to where AI models are built and scaled up.\nThere are multiple practical uses for the technology that could bolster its earnings in the coming years. For example, improving its AI capabilities could further secure the company's hold on the search engine market by creating a Google Search experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nAI could also enhance Google Cloud, make its ads more effective for marketers, and improve users' experience on YouTube with better video recommendations. If done right, Alphabet could elevate its entire business with AI, and boost its stock price over the long term.\nThis chart suggests Alphabet's stock is one of the best investments on the basis of value when compared to those three peers in big tech. It has the lowest forward price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash-flow, indicating its shares are a relative bargain.\nAlthough the stock has skyrocketed over the last decade, its potent position in tech and the emergence of AI suggest that it's not done yet. Alphabet is a screaming buy right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 29, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META and Tesla TSLA.\nWe have Apple and Amazon on deck to report Q1 results this week, and we will need to wait a few more weeks before we see Nvidia\u2019s numbers. But we have already seen Q1 results from the other four members of the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 group: Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Tesla.\nIt is hard to find any weakness in the Microsoft and Alphabet reports, and the market\u2019s reaction to these two reports shows that investors agree with that assessment. The Alphabet report appears to reassure investors that it has a credible AI strategy in place and may not be that far behind Microsoft in this critical race.\nThe market reaction to the Tesla and Meta reports needs to be contextualized.\nMeta shares were very strong performers prior to this report, and any way you look at the company\u2019s Q1 results, they are impressive. Meta\u2019s Q1 earnings were up +80.5% from the year-earlier period on +27.3% higher revenues. Investors\u2019 beef with the Meta report is the company\u2019s guidance for capital expenditures, which is going up significantly to strengthen the company\u2019s AI capabilities.\nI think the reaction is overdone, but it likely reminds investors of the pain created by the company\u2019s earlier metaverse plans. Perhaps there is a basis for those worries, given the metaverse history. But as we are seeing with Microsoft and Alphabet, leadership in AI requires a lot of spending. If market participants are okay with Microsoft and Alphabet spending hands-over-fist on AI, then they should also be okay with Meta.\nTesla shares have been the worst performing of the group, with many starting to speak out that perhaps it didn\u2019t deserve to be part of this group. The stock price weakness reflects the steadily deteriorating earnings outlook, with a combination of softening demand and heightened competitive pressures forcing Elon Musk to cut prices.\nGiven this stock\u2019s price action and estimates revision trajectory coming into the quarterly release, investors were conditioned to expect the worst from Tesla, but the actual results were simply bad (instead of \u2018very bad\u2019). They missed on the top- and bottom lines and didn\u2019t provide any favorable or reassuring commentary about the outlook. But investors were relieved that the numbers weren\u2019t as ugly as they had started fearing.\nTesla shares are still laggards relative to other Mag 7 stocks.\nUsing estimates for Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia, which will release their March-quarter results on April 30th, May 2nd, and May 22nd, respectively, and actual results for the other four members of the group, total Q1 earnings for the group are expected to be up +43.7% from the same period last year on +13.2% higher revenues.\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 29.1% of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 20.6% of the index\u2019s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 21.6% of all S&P 500 earnings.\nGiven the group's enormous earnings power and growth profile, it is hard to argue with its market leadership.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +27.1% from the same period last year on +8.7% higher revenues.\nWe remain in the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with more than 950 companies reporting results, including 177 S&P 500 members.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL division Google agrees to expunge billions of browsing data in order to settle a consumer privacy lawsuit.The class-action lawsuit, which was filed in 2020, claims that the company collected data secretly from the use of Chrome web browser in a private \u201cincognito\u201d mode by several people across the world.Google was alleged for tracking data on users\u2019 friends, favorite foods, hobbies, shopping habits, and even personal and intimate things.Notably, the terms of the settlement were filed in the Oakland, CA, federal court. Although plaintiffs asked for $5 billion in damages, Google is paying no damages.Instead, Google will update disclosures about what it collects in \"private\" browsing. Further, it will allow Incognito users to block third-party cookies for five years.Moreover, the deletion of user data remains a big concession on GOOGL\u2019s end as the data helped the company in enticing various advertisers by helping them to focus on their target customers.\n\u00a0\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\nThe steps taken by Google to settle the underlined lawsuit are crucial for Alphabet.Updating disclosure, along with deletion of data, will make the search giant more transparent, which, in turn, will likely boost the traffic on its search engine platform.Reportedly, a GOOGL spokesperson mentioned that destroying old technical data remains positive for the company, which claims that it never associated data with users in the Incognito mode or used it for personalization.\nAlthough data privacy lawsuits do not bode well for data-driven Alphabet, its strong initiatives toward bolstering its search engine, enhancing search results, and ensuring high security of data to its app and product users should not be ignored. Moreover, its growing endeavors to combat privacy breaches are laudable.To this end, the company restricts third-party cookies in its Chrome web browser to ensure users\u2019 privacy. This stops advertisers from connecting their browser cookies to non-operating websites, which reflects Google\u2019s user-oriented focus.The company\u2019s growing efforts to remove bad ads from its search platform are noteworthy. In this regard, the introduction of a tool called Ads Transparency Center, which is designed to enable users to know about the ads they see on Search, YouTube and Display, is noteworthy.The tool acts like a searchable hub of all ads served by verified advertisers. Moreover, it shows the ads served in the past 30 days from the company\u2019s list of verified advertisers. The information it provides about any ad includes the advertiser of the ad, the regions where the ad was shown, the last date the ad ran and the format of the ad.All the above-mentioned measures are likely to aid Alphabet\u2019s search business, which, in turn, will benefit the performance of its Google Services segment, which is one of its key growth drivers and major contributors to the total revenues. GOOGL has gained 11.3% year to date, outperforming the industry\u2019s rally of 10.5%.\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Applied Materials AMAT, BlackLine BL and AMETEK AME, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

        "Author": "  Jeran Wittenstein, Ryan Vlastelica and Subrat Patnaik ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. is bringing in so much cash that hopes are rising it will take a page out of the Meta Platforms Inc. playbook and start paying a dividend.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUS Economy Slows and Inflation Jumps, Damping Soft-Landing Hopes\nMalaysia in Talks With Tycoons on Casino to Revive $100 Billion Forest City\nBiden\u2019s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll Shows\nZuckerberg Asks for Patience as Meta\u2019s AI Push Spooks Market\nHow to Get a Meeting With the UAE\u2019s $1.5 Trillion Man\nThe search giant has been plowing excess cash into share buybacks for years and many investors expect another $70 billion to be earmarked when Alphabet reports earnings on April 25. But analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Truist Securities are among those that see a small dividend as a way to move the needle further for the stock, similar to Meta\u2019s February move that helped fuel a 20% jump in shares.\n\u201cA dividend would be well received,\u201d said Andrew Zamfotis, portfolio manager at Ami Asset Management Corp. \u201cWhile investors are still looking for growth from these companies, today there is also value in cost discipline and the decision to initiate a dividend suggests that management will be prudent and attempt to allocate capital in a way that balances growth and capital return.\u201d\nDividends have traditionally been seen as the province of more mature and slower-growing companies but the policy has been gaining popularity among tech firms. In addition to Meta, Salesforce Inc. and Booking Holdings Inc. have also initiated dividends in recent months. Among the six biggest US technology companies by market value, Alphabet and Amazon.com Inc. are the only ones that don\u2019t have a quarterly payout.\nAlphabet shares are up 10% this year, outperforming Microsoft Corp., as well as the Nasdaq 100. Rising optimism about its generative AI strategy has supported the stock of late, though it fell to a three-month low in March in the wake of a disappointing earnings report and fears that artificial intelligence tools could challenge its dominance in search advertising.\nWith Alphabet\u2019s revenue expected to rise 14% this year and cost cutting efforts supporting profitability, the company\u2019s free cash flow is projected to hit a record $83 billion in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Google parent also had more than $110 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2023.\n\u201cWe think Alphabet is likely to follow Meta\u2019s lead by introducing dividends this year,\u201d said Tejas Dessai, research analyst at Global X ETFs. \u201cGiven the favorable advertising market and recent cost-saving measures, now seems opportune for such a move, which has generally been positively received by investors.\u201d\nOf course, Alphabet faces other demands for its cash, such as adding AI computing capacity. The company had a record $32 billion in capital expenditures last year and that spending is expected to jump another 27% in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. However, the feeling on Wall Street is that Alphabet has plenty of cash for infrastructure spending as well as bigger capital returns.\nRather than seeing dividend initiations as a sign that the companies have fewer investment opportunities, market professionals are now viewing it as a sign of strength.\n\u201cFor corporations, sitting on cash in this environment is still suboptimal\u201d said Jenny Harrington, chief executive officer at Gilman Hill Asset Management. \u201cEven if they\u2019re getting 5% on cash, the credit they get for returning cash to shareholders through dividends, or the bump they get from buybacks, mean that those are better capital allocation decisions.\u201d\nTech Chart of the Day\nNvidia Corp shares plummeted 10% on Friday, their biggest one-day drop since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, and the stock closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since November. The slump erased nearly $212 billion off its market capitalization. The move came amid widespread tech selling, with AI companies seeing some of the most pronounced weakness. Shares edged higher on Monday, rising 2.8%.\nTop Tech Stories\nAfter years of working to assure the US government that its popular social media app isn\u2019t a threat to national security, TikTok\u2019s loss in that fight now seems almost inevitable.\nAustralia is gearing up for a showdown with Elon Musk and US social media giants over allegations they failed to move fast enough to police graphic content and misinformation during two violent attacks in Sydney over the past 10 days.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. options traders are contending with a rising wave of bearishness following the chipmaker\u2019s cautious guidance and concerns about whether the artificial-intelligence trade is unwinding.\nApple has long relied on China and the iPhone for growth. As those revenue sources continue to falter, the company must explore new regions and products to get back on track.\nUS Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Huawei Technologies Co.\u2019s latest phone shows that China remains behind on cutting-edge chip technology.\nEarnings Due Monday\nPremarket\nVerizon\nPostmarket\nCadence Design\nCalix\n(Updates to add stock move in Tech Chart of the Day section.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nUS White-Collar Job Growth Stalls, Even in Pandemic Boomtowns\nCaught Between the US and China, a Powerful AI Upstart Chooses Sides\nA Hedge Fund Billionaire\u2019s Cash Helped Fund a \u2018Predatory\u2019 Lender\nBig Junk Food\u2019s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner\nStudio Behind Dune Eyes Growth, Even Without a Paramount Merger\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

On the top line, Q1 sales of $67.59 billion expanded 16% from $58.06 billion a year ago and came in 2% above estimates.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe strong results were attributed to Google Search, Cloud, and stronger advertising growth on YouTube. Alphabet also emphasized that it is well-positioned for the next wave of artificial intelligence through its platform Gemini which is a generative AI multimodal with understanding across audio, video, and text code.\nNotably, Google Cloud revenue beat estimates by 3% and grew 28% year over year to $9.57 billion with Alphabet still thought to hold the third spot in the domestic cloud computing market behind Amazon\u2019s AMZN\u00a0AWS and Microsoft\u2019s MSFT\u00a0Azure.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMarket Cap & Dividend\nAlphabet\u2019s quarterly dividend will be $0.20 per share with the first payout set for June 17 to shareholders on record as of June 10.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "According to market speculations, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL is reportedly considering a bold move into the realm of online marketing software by exploring the acquisition of HubSpot Inc. HUBS, a company valued at $35 billion. The potential deal comes at a time of heightened regulatory scrutiny in the tech sector under the Biden administration.With a substantial cash reserve of $110.9 billion as of December 2023, Alphabet is probably considering HubSpot as an opportunity to strategically deploy its resources and expand its market presence. Although discussions have taken place with investment bankers at Morgan Stanley, Alphabet has yet to formally submit an offer to HubSpot.HubSpot, headquartered in Cambridge, MA, specializes in providing sales and marketing software to small and midsize businesses, leveraging digital channels such as blogs, search engines and social media. Its diversified offerings include customer relationship management (CRM) and payment services, making it an attractive asset for Alphabet.From Alphabet's perspective, acquiring HubSpot would not only bolster its presence in the burgeoning CRM software market but also provide a significant boost to its cloud computing business, intensifying competition with industry giants like Microsoft and Amazon. Additionally, Alphabet could potentially argue that this acquisition will enhance competition in the marketing and sales software sector, countering the dominance of players like Salesforce and Microsoft.For HubSpot, an acquisition by Alphabet could offer access to greater resources and technological capabilities, enabling it to further innovate and expand its market reach. While neither company has confirmed the discussions, market speculations are driving investor interest, underscoring the potential significance of this deal for both companies in navigating the evolving landscape of the tech industry.Shares of HubSpot surged 100.8% in 2023, driven by improved market demand across its portfolio on the back of a flexible business model and solid cash flow. With healthy fundamentals, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock appears primed for a similar performance in 2024 as well and is likely to be a lucrative acquisition target for Alphabet.

        "Title": "Better AI Buy: Microsoft vs. Alphabet Stock",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman and Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After the launch of ChatGPT, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) emerged as top rivals, and that battle has persisted. Microsoft has aligned itself with ChatGPT parent OpenAI, while Alphabet has sought to challenge its leadership with products like Bard and later Gemini. So which artificial intelligence (AI) stock is the better buy?\nJeremy Bowman (Microsoft): The question of whether to build or buy is a common one in technology, and in generative AI, Microsoft and Alphabet have largely gone in different directions in this regard.\nMicrosoft has tied its fortunes to OpenAI, the ChatGPT parent, through a reported $13 billion investment, and that has enabled Microsoft to essentially use OpenAI's technology as its own. As a result, the tech giant has been able to implement OpenAI's technology in products like its Azure cloud infrastructure services, GitHub code repository, Office productivity suite, and Bing search engine.\nThose moves are already having an impact as Microsoft said that AI added 6 percentage points to Azure's growth in the most recent quarter.\nMicrosoft's diversification also acts as a competitive advantage here. Unlike Alphabet, which makes a majority of its revenue from search advertising, Microsoft has a wide array of products that span enterprise software, video games, cloud computing, social media, and more, and that gives it more opportunities to leverage the power of AI.\nMicrosoft has also been more aggressive in AI than Alphabet has. CEO Satya Nadella has apparently been planning for this moment for years, as Microsoft first invested in back in 2019.\nAlphabet has also been investing in AI for several years, but the company has been more hesitant to release new products, and when it has it hasn't always gone well. The initial presentation for Bard was sloppy and widely panned, and Gemini has been criticized for historical inaccuracies.\nMicrosoft shows no intention of slowing down in AI; it just hired Deepmind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, who also co-founded the recently shuttered Inflection AI. Microsoft stock may be expensive, but it deserves to trade at a premium. It will be hard to catch the AI leader.\nAnders Bylund (Alphabet): I have nothing but respect for Microsoft, but Redmond's finest can't measure up to Alphabet's ultimate long-term planning.\nAlphabet's visionary approach and unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of innovation make it a compelling choice for investors seeking long-term growth. The company's core business -- online search and advertising under the Google banner -- dominates the search engine market. However, Alphabet's ambitions extend far beyond search, with the company consistently investing in cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to reshape entire industries.\nOne such area is artificial intelligence, where Alphabet's research and development efforts have produced groundbreaking advancements. From natural language processing to computer vision, Alphabet's AI technologies are being applied in diverse fields, from healthcare research to self-driving vehicles.\nMoreover, Alphabet's commitment to moonshot projects through its X division showcases its willingness to take calculated risks in pursuit of revolutionary innovations. Projects like Intrinsic, Alphabet's industrial robotics project, and Loon, which aims to provide internet access to remote areas via high-altitude balloons, exemplify the company's audacious vision and long-term thinking.\nLong story short, Alphabet is ready to roll with the punches as the tech market evolves. Furthermore, the stock is much more affordable than Microsoft, whose stock has soared on the wings of its deep OpenAI partnership. You can pick up Alphabet shares at the reasonable price of 6 times sales or 27 times free cash flow today.

        "Title": "Unlocking Intrinsic Value: Analysis of Alphabet Inc",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MA.\nAs of 2024-04-15, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $185.66. It's currently trading at a price of $157.77. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 15.02%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$5.94\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.57%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 21.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n102.56\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n106.93\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n185.66\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $166.94. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 5.49%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Alphabet's Stock Was Up 10% in March. Are Investors too Late?",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The stock market had a fairly bland month in March, with the broad S&P 500 index increasing about 2.3%. But, some companies, like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), had a much better March, with the stock rising 10%.\nWith that kind of rally in mind, many might wonder if they're too late on the stock and should look elsewhere. While it would be nice to hop in a time machine to correct your investing mistakes, it's not possible. Still, I think there are enough positive signs for Alphabet that you can still confidently buy, even if the stock rose 10% in March.\nEntering March, Alphabet lagged behind many of its big tech peers. The stock traded for a valuation less than that of the S&P 500, which was suspect considering the business's quality.\nMuch of the dismay around Alphabet's stock had to deal with its various generative artificial intelligence (AI) rollout blunders. Now that the investing public has moved on from those mistakes and realized that Alphabet's primary business is doing well, it's finally getting the respect it deserves.\nAdvertising accounts for 76% of Alphabet's revenue. This revenue comes from high-quality properties like the Google search engine and YouTube -- two dominant brands in their respective niches. Because of how much of a staple these two are, its revenue streams are highly consistent. Ad revenue was up 11% in the fourth quarter, and management also commented on its confidence to deliver healthy growth through 2024 during its conference call. This sets Alphabet's base case fairly high, as many of its other divisions are experiencing strong growth.\nIts Google Cloud cloud computing division may be less than 10% of its total revenue stream, but it has a bright future. It grew 26% in Q4 and is vital in developing AI technologies, as many generative AI start-ups are Google Cloud customers.\nThe subscription business has also had a strong showing, as its revenue was up 23%, driven by YouTube subscriptions.\nWith advertising doing well and the growth divisions succeeding, it's no wonder Alphabet bounced back from its low valuation to start the month. But why is it still a buy?\nAs mentioned above, Alphabet was cheaper than the S&P 500. While it no longer holds that designation, it's only slightly more expensive now from a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) standpoint.\nThe S&P 500 trades at 21.6 times forward earnings, which is hardly valued at a premium, something that can't be said about many of its big tech peers. With Microsoft, Apple, and Meta Platforms trading at 36, 26, and 24 times forward earnings, respectively, it's still cheaper than its peers.\nValuing this cohort using forward earnings is a much better metric than using trailing earnings, as each is undergoing significant change due to AI influence.\nAlphabet's first-quarter results will likely be available in late April (based on last year's release date), and investors will look to that to confirm their suspicions on why Alphabet deserves to be trading at higher levels. Some key focus points will be its advertising revenue growth and its operating margin. For ad revenue, if it can match or exceed Q4's 11% growth rate, it will be considered a success.\nOperating margin is a key indicator of Alphabet's financial discipline, which came into question last year. It went through multiple layoffs and expense reductions to improve its positioning. As long as Alphabet maintains its current margin level, investors should be happy.\nWith Alphabet's stock trading at reasonable levels, plus a chance for a great quarterly report on the horizon, I'm confident that investors can buy Alphabet stock now without fear of overpaying.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sheila Dang ",
        "Text": "By Sheila Dang\n(Reuters) - Investors appear to be losing patience with Big Tech's prodigious artificial intelligence investments this week after Meta Platforms signaled deeper spending and a long road to profitability.\nThe concession from Meta in its quarterly report late on Wednesday cast a cloud over Microsoft and Alphabet, which will both report quarterly earnings on Thursday.\nMeta's stock sank 15% in extended trade after it forecast higher AI spending next year, while Microsoft was down 2%, Alphabet fell 3% and Nvidia dropped 1.4% in reaction.\nWall Street's heavyweight tech-related companies have been locked in a fierce battle to advance generative AI, which can create text, videos and photos from prompts and is seen as the next frontier in tech.\nDuring Meta's earnings conference call, analysts peppered CEO Mark Zuckerberg with questions about how the company was pacing its AI investments. One analyst asked whether Meta was spending more because it saw an even bigger opportunity from AI.\n\"I think we've gotten more ambitious and optimistic on AI,\" Zuckerberg responded, pointing to Meta's recent launches of new AI models. \"So all of that basically encourages me to make sure that we're investing to stay at the leading edge of this.\"\nAlphabet and Microsoft both said earlier this year when they reported fourth-quarter results that they expected rising AI costs. The investor reaction on Wednesday indicated deepening concerns.\nIn a research note on Monday about Alphabet, analysts from New Street Research said the potential for materially higher capital expenditures was a worry ahead of results on Thursday.\nThe research firm said it now expects Alphabet's full-year capital expenditures to be $45.9 billion, up from its previous estimate of $42.7 billion.\nGoogle has been working to catch up in the generative AI race and released Gemini, a model that can understand and create different types of information including text, audio and video.\nCreating content with generative AI is energy-intensive, and Zuckerberg cited the cost as a reason for Meta's higher expenses.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has positioned itself to be a winner in AI due to its partnership with OpenAI, which kicked off the generative AI craze last year with ChatGPT, said analysts from Jefferies in a note on March 31.\nMicrosoft has integrated chatbots into its suite of Office products and is planning to invest more in data centers.\nIndustry-wide, shareholders are now focused on looking for revenue, including pricing models and whether customers can find use cases that justify the cost of generative AI, Jefferies wrote.\n\"Last year was spent dreaming of gen AI's potential,\" the analysts wrote. \"This year will be about moving forward with concrete steps.\"\n(Reporting by Sheila Dang in Austin; additional reporting by Yuvraj Malik; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 23.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 32.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 30%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Alphabet is 16.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -19.4%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.5%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Alphabet. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 13.1% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Alphabet a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Alphabet is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 23, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META.\nWe have entered the heart of the 2024 Q1 earnings cycle with a notably stacked earnings schedule on deck for this week. The period has primarily been positive so far, with the big banks' results not causing any spooks.\nAnd concerning this week's busy docket, two 'Mag 7' members \u2013 Alphabet and Meta Platforms \u2013 are scheduled to unveil quarterly results.\nAlphabet will report after the market close on April 25th, whereas Meta will report on April 24th after the market close. Shares of each have been considerably strong in 2024, outperforming the S&P 500 handily.\nAdvertising revenue is a significant chunk of each company's business and will undoubtedly be a focal point in the releases. But how does everything stack up heading into their quarterly releases? Let's take a closer look at what's expected.\nMeta Platforms\nThe outlook for Meta's upcoming release has turned visibly bright, with the $4.32 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 20% since the end of January and suggesting 63% year-over-year growth. Favorable cost-cutting measures have aided the company's profitability picture in a big way.\nConcerning Advertising revenue, the Zacks Consensus Estimate presently stands at $35.6 billion, suggesting a sizable 27% growth rate from the year-ago period. The tech titan has regularly exceeded our expectations for this metric as of late, with the most recent beat totaling $827 million.\nDespite their strong run, shares aren't valuation stretched, with the current forward 12-month earnings multiple of 22.8X nearly in line with the 21.6X five-year median and well beneath highs of 31.5X in 2020. In addition, the current PEG ratio of 1.2X reflects that investors aren't overpaying for the forecasted growth.\nShares have had a tough showing over the last month, losing roughly 5% alongside the S&P 500's 4% decline. Further weakness post-earnings could be a great purchase point for investors if the company's guidance is solid, which will keep analysts' revisions positive.\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nAlphabet\nAnalysts haven't shown as much positivity for Alphabet's upcoming release compared to META, with the $1.49 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up a modest 2% since the end of January. The company's forecasted growth remains strong, expected to post 28% earnings growth on nearly 14% higher sales.\nThe Zacks Consensus estimate for Advertising revenue stands at $60.1 billion, 10% higher than the year-ago mark of $54.5 billion. The company fell short of the consensus estimate in its latest release by $105 million, snapping a previous streak of positive surprises on the metric.\nLike META, shares aren't overly stretched concerning valuation, with the current 21.8X forward 12-month earnings multiple nearly in line with the five-year median and well beneath highs of 32.6X in 2021. The PEG ratio works out to 1.4X, again in line with the five-year median and beneath five-year highs of 1.9X.\nShares have displayed relative strength over the last month, gaining 4% in value compared to the S&P 500's 4% decline. Favorable commentary from the release concerning AI developments and advertising trends can help keep the stock's momentum positive, though it is critical to follow analysts' revisions post-earnings.\nEarnings season kicks into a much higher gear this week, with a wide variety of companies scheduled to report quarterly results.\nBoth Alphabet and Meta have continued their momentum in 2024, outperforming handily. Analysts have been positive for both companies' quarterly releases, though positive revisions are much more pronounced within META.\nPost-earnings weakness could be prevalent given the recent strong runs, though both companies' fundamentals continue to make them an attractive long-term play.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Oracle Corporation (ORCL) and Chevron Corporation (CVX). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Alphabet shares have modestly lagged the Zacks Tech sector over the year-to-date period (+9.6% vs. +12.2%), but have performed roughly in-line with the S&P 500 index (+9.6% vs. +10%) over this time period. The company\u2019s robust cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results.Moreover, Google\u2019s mobile search is gaining solid momentum. Additionally, strong focus on bolstering generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the near term. Alphabet\u2019s deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind.The company\u2019s strong efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. Also, its expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well. However, sluggish Network advertisement business is a negative. Increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns.(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)Shares of Oracle have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+19.5% vs. +11.4%). The company\u2019s third-quarter fiscal 2023 results benefited from the steady adoption of strategic cloud applications, autonomous database and OCI, as well as a recovery in cloud revenue growth.Oracle\u2019s Gen 2 Cloud is driving artificial intelligence (AI) clientele because of better performance at a lower cost due to high bandwidth and low-latency RDMA networks. ORCL\u2019s continued investment in cloud infrastructure positions it well for sustained growth in the dynamic software industry. Its share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy.However, the uncertain economy and competition in the cloud computing market weighed on demand for its cloud offerings. Stiff competition in the cloud market is slowing down the growth of its expansion efforts in the competitive market.(You can read the full research report on Oracle here >>>)Chevron shares have underperformed the Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-2.6% vs. +4.5%). The company is grappling with lower prices in the upstream segment and declining refining margins in the downstream unit.Another concern is the sub-100% reserve replacement ratio, indicating challenges in replenishing produced energy. Considering all these factors, investors are advised to wait for a better entry point.Nevertheless, Chevron is positioned as one of the top global integrated oil firms, set for sustainable production growth, particularly due to its dominant position in the lucrative Permian Basin. Further, the recent acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to significantly strengthen Chevron's presence in oil-rich Guyana.(You can read the full research report on Chevron here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Chubb Limited (CB), Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 22, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Tesla TSLA, Meta Platforms META, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\nMany in the market are looking to this week's quarterly results from the four members of 'the Magnificent 7' to help reverse the stock market's ongoing weakness.\nThe immediate catalyst for the stock market pullback appears to be tied to the timing of Fed easing as a result of the evolving inflation picture rather than any deterioration in the overall earnings picture. If anything, the overall earnings picture has actually been improving ever so slightly in recent weeks, as we have been noting in our earnings commentary.\nThe hope appears to be that robust results from the Mag 7 companies reporting this week \u2013 Tesla on Tuesday, April 23rd, Meta Platforms on Wednesday, April 24th, Microsoft and Alphabet on Thursday, April 25th \u2013 will help restore confidence in the market's fundamental underpinnings and offset some of the Fed-centric worries.\nAs the above chart shows, Meta is in a league of its own, while Microsoft and Alphabet are roughly tracking each other.\nThis pecking order, with Meta at the top and Tesla at the bottom, remains unchanged when we begin tracking from October 27, 2023.\nThis divergence in performance reflects each stock's earnings outlook, with Meta enjoying the best and Tesla the worst.\nThe current Q1 Zacks Consensus EPS for Meta of $4.32 has increased +20% since late January 2024. On the other hand, Tesla's Q1 EPS estimate of $0.46 has been cut by more than -41% over the same period.\nTesla's woes are well known, ranging from a distracted leader to fundamental supply-demand forces for its core product. Meta is benefiting from an improving digital ad market and effective cost controls.\nQ1 estimates for Microsoft and Alphabet have barely moved higher, with both largely seen as leading the AI effort. It is unlikely that we will see any tangible developments from either of these two companies on their respective AI strategies, but we will nevertheless get more clarity about the coming periods.\nThe group is expected to bring in +33% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +12.7% higher revenues.\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. The group jumped back into the 'regular/normal' growth model last year, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.4% from the same period last year on +8.3% higher revenues.\nAs was the case with the 'Mag 7', the Tech sector as a whole dealt with the pulled-forward revenues during 2021 but is expected to remain firmly in growth mode.\nThis week, we enter the heart of the Q1 earnings season, with more than 500 companies reporting results, including 155 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned mega-cap Tech players, we literally have a representative cross-section of the market on deck to report results this week.\nThrough Friday, April 19th, we have seen Q1 results from 71 S&P 500 index members. Total Q1 earnings for these 71 index members are up +9.4% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, with 77.5% beating EPS estimates and 63.4% beating revenue estimates.\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +3.8% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.8% on +1.7% revenue growth.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Expectations are Moving Higher \nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "Title": "Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft earnings will be all about AI and whether one of them deserves to be on the \u2018wall of worry\u2019",
        "Author": "  Rachyl Jones ",
        "Text": "Since the blockbuster debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in November 2022, the topic of AI has dominated the earnings calls of many tech companies. Executives from Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have mentioned the acronym nearly 200 times in each earnings cycle since, including during the first earnings week this year in January and February.\nAnalysts expect AI to be the central theme yet again during earnings calls for the first three months of this year, with Meta reporting on Wednesday, followed by Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet on Thursday. But the talk from executives has shifted from \u201cwhat AI can do?\u201d to \u201cwhat AI is doing?,\u201d and all three of this week\u2019s Big Tech companies will have a different answer.\nFor Microsoft, cloud computing platform Azure is the star of its AI portfolio, according to analysts from Goldman Sachs and Citi. Launched more than a decade ago, Azure now offers a suite of AI tools to businesses including a service that builds custom generative AI apps from existing models. Azure is \u201cone of the best-positioned AI players\u201d in the market and the \u201cmain lever\u201d for Microsoft to make money on generative AI right now, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a Sunday note to investors. That confidence partly comes from Microsoft not having to drastically change how it makes money to drive additional revenue from AI, they wrote.\nIn contrast, most of Google\u2019s revenue comes from search and related services, which AI from other companies could eventually replace. Google could cannibalize its search business by building a rival AI one, but that would leave it in a precarious position.\nAzure\u2019s business grew 30% year-over-year for the quarter ending December 31, with six points of that growth coming directly from the demand by its customers for AI-related products, CFO Amy Hood said during the company\u2019s earnings call. Expect an additional one to two percentage points of growth from AI services for the first three months of 2024, Citi analysts said in an April 18 report. Microsoft also has other budding AI businesses that the analysts say will contribute meaningfully to revenue next year\u2014namely, the company\u2019s virtual assistant, Copilot.\nAnalysts are generally less confident in Google\u2019s business than in Microsoft\u2019s, with Goldman analysts calling its parent\u2019s stock a \u201cwall of worry.\u201d In addition to questioning the growth of\u00a0 Google\u2019s search business in an AI future, investors worry about the company\u2019s operating margins and the impact of potential regulation. Investors will also have \u201ca heightened degree of concern\u201d about how much Google is spending on AI over the coming earnings seasons, Goldman\u2019s analysts wrote.\nStill, Google is a leader in the AI cloud world, which includes many of the services it offers to other businesses, Goldman analysts said in an April 15 report. At Google\u2019s Cloud Next event earlier this month, the company announced expanded access to large language model Gemini and an AI-powered coding assistant.\nWhile Meta offers an AI assistant and large language model similar to Microsoft\u2019s and Google\u2019s\u2014including its new Llama 3 model introduced last week, which is free for research and commercial use\u2014that\u2019s not what analysts have their eyes on. In notes from Goldman, Citi, and Bank of America, analysts put much more emphasis on how Meta is using AI to improve its social media algorithms.\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, makes most of its money from advertising. The more time users spend scrolling through their feeds, the more ads they see, and the more revenue Meta generates. In recent months, the company has been working on rebuilding its model for recommending videos to Facebook users, with the help of AI. If effective, the tweak could keep users on Meta\u2019s platforms for longer. When tested on Facebook Reels last year, the new AI-powered technology contributed to \u201can 8% to 10% gain in Reels watch time,\u201d Facebook head Tom Alison said at a tech conference last month.\nIt is still early for these tools, Bank of America analysts said in an April 19 note, but that means investors could enjoy some \u201cpositive product surprises\u201d and revenue growth this year. And with a potential U.S. ban on TikTok, a major competitor, Meta's business is looking well positioned at the moment, they said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp and Alphabet Inc saw the biggest jump in their market capitalisation in March, driven by artificial intelligence (AI) enthusiasm and anticipation for new products and expansion plans.\nNvidia's market cap soared to $2.25 trillion at March-end, up 14% from February, while Alphabet's rose 9% to $1.8 trillion.\nNvidia's shares saw an upswing last month as the company announced its latest flagship AI processor is slated for release later this year, while Alphabet's shares got a lift from reports of Apple's interest in integrating Google's Gemini AI engine into the iPhone.\nThe AI-driven market optimism also lifted Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). TSMC's market cap jumped about 12% to $632.5 billion.\nConversely, Tesla Inc faced the largest market cap drop, falling about 13% to $559.8 billion amid demand concerns, rising competition, and scrutiny over CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package.\nApple Inc experienced a decline, with its market cap dropping 5.1% to $2.65 trillion, amid slowing iPhone sales and a recent $2 billion fine from European regulators for antitrust violations.\nOverall, major tech firms have experienced significant market gains this year. So far in 2024, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and TSMC's market caps have risen 81.8%, 42%, and 26%, respectively.\n\"For investors with excessive exposure to large-cap tech names and looking to diversify beyond the sector, we see opportunities in US small-caps and select European small- and mid-cap stocks,\" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\"We think their performance should approach that of their large-cap peers amid a supportive macro backdrop, and we see value in adding them in portfolios.\"\n(Reporting By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra in Bengaluru; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne)\n"

        "Title": "Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet All Just Shared Magnificent News for Nvidia Investors",
        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If you didn't think the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) could get any stronger, think again.\nFour of the biggest tech companies in the world all reported very strong demand for AI applications, and that's great news for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker designs the leading GPUs for training the large language models powering new generative AI applications. It could see a big increase in business based on recent management commentary from Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\nHere's what they had to say and what it all means for Nvidia and its investors.\nTesla plans to unveil its robotaxi in August. The Cybercab relies on Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) capabilities, which use artificial intelligence to make real-time driving decisions.\nTo train that AI, Tesla has rapidly expanded its AI training infrastructure. CEO Elon Musk says the company doubled its training compute power sequentially in the first quarter. What's more, he expects Tesla's cluster of 35,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs to expand to about 85,000 by the year's end, just for training its AI.\nThat's a huge investment coming Nvidia's way. It's also a major endorsement for Nvidia from Musk, who had previously considered other chipmakers' GPUs.\nMeta has been spending heavily to build out data centers to train its artificial intelligence, but now, it sees a good reason to spend even more.\nAlongside its first-quarter earnings release, Meta shared plans to increase its capital expenditures from its original range of $30 billion to $37 billion to somewhere between $35 billion and $40 billion when all is said and done in 2024. And the company expects to spend even more than that in 2025.\nThat's because CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees an opportunity for Meta to \"build leading AI models and be the leading AI company in the world.\"\nMeta has made excellent progress in just a few years developing its LLaMA large language model. It recently released version 3 of the model, rolling out its Meta AI chatbot alongside it. Zuckerberg thinks there are a lot of business opportunities for Meta if it can build an AI model used by hundreds of millions of people around the world.\nBut to get there, it has to spend heavily, and a lot of that spending will go toward Nvidia's chips, at least for the time being. Meta's also building its own custom silicon to train its AI.\nMeta's not the only company that's planning to increase its spending on AI infrastructure. Microsoft also expects a big step up in spending thanks to the growing demand for AI.\n\"Currently, near-term AI demand is a bit higher than our available capacity,\" CFO Amy Hood told analysts during Microsoft's fiscal third-quarter earnings call.\nMicrosoft set itself up as the leading public cloud service provider for AI application developers when it announced a $10 billion investment in OpenAI at the start of 2023. That move has paid off handsomely as the growing demand for AI has led Microsoft to take share from other public cloud competitors. But even as it invests in adding capacity, it seemingly hasn't been able to keep up.\nMicrosoft now plans to increase spending for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and fiscal 2025 in order to meet the growing demand. It's also developing its own AI using OpenAI's GPT model, which powers its Copilot software.\nAgain, a lot of the step up in spending will go toward buying more Nvidia chips for its cloud customers' needs. Microsoft, however, does design its own chips as well.\nThere were many market-pleasing surprises in Alphabet's first-quarter earnings report, but one should stand out to Nvidia's investors.\nAlphabet poured $12 billion into capital expenditures last quarter. That's nearly double what it spent during the year-ago period.\nAlphabet's investments will primarily go toward adding capacity to Google Cloud and building and training more advanced AI models. Alphabet is also integrating AI into search -- it recently rolled out AI-powered answers at the top of certain search queries.\nIt's worth noting Alphabet uses its own chip designs to train its Gemini model, but it will still commit some spending to Nvidia as its cloud customers demand those chips.\nWe're currently in the midst of an AI arms race. As Microsoft pointed out, the demand for AI compute is bigger than the supply.\nThat's been an incredible boon for Nvidia, which can't produce chips fast enough to supply everyone who wants them. As a result, its pricing power has gone through the roof. Its gross margin climbed from 56.9% in fiscal 2023 to 72.7% in fiscal 2024. The comments from its fellow Magnificent Seven companies suggest demand continues to outpace supply, which bodes well for Nvidia going forward.\nEven after an incredible run over the last couple of years, Nvidia could still benefit from the increased spending from big tech over the next two years. However, a lot of that spending is going toward developing and deploying those companies' own chip designs. Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta all design their own AI training and inference chips. Apple is reportedly working on its own AI data center chips as well.\nAs these big companies shift more of their AI workload to their own chip designs, it'll take a huge bite out of Nvidia's demand. And despite strong demand trends from smaller enterprises without in-house designs, it's hard to overcome that challenge.\nTo be sure, the next few years will likely be very good for Nvidia, but its position at the top of the AI food chain is rather precarious. With shares trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 35 as of this writing, investors are expecting very high sustained earnings growth for years to come. I'm not sold that Nvidia has the competitive moat to make that happen, even if the near-term demand appears extremely promising.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Why Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Crashed on Thursday",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The biggest driver of headlines across the technology sector over the past year or so has been the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's biggest companies see a vast opportunity resulting from AI and are investing accordingly to stake their claim in the AI revolution. What some investors weren't prepared for, however, is the level of spending necessary to reap the windfall that AI is expected to unleash over the next few years.\nWith that as a backdrop, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) slumped 3.4%, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was off 2.5%, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) fell 2.2%, as of 1:05 p.m. ET on Thursday.\nTo be clear, there was very little company-specific news driving these so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower today (more on that in a bit). This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to the quarterly results reported by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and what it means for other big players in the AI space.\nMeta Platforms released its first-quarter report after the market closed on Wednesday, and while the results were better than expected, there was one revelation that caught investors off guard.\nThe company reported revenue of $36.4 billion, up 27% year over year. Expenses advanced at a more modest pace, growing just 6%. This benefited operating margins, which surged to 38%, up from 25% in the year-ago quarter. This also helped expand Meta's profits, as earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71 soared 114%.\nThe results easily surpassed expectations, as analysts' consensus estimates forecast revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32. However, it was an update to the company's full-year spending plans that sent the stock reeling.\nLike its Magnificent Seven counterparts, Meta has been at the forefront of generative AI, eager to earn its part of the trillions of dollars the technology is expected to generate over the coming decade or so. However, \"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch,\" as the saying goes, and these systems are costly to develop. Not only is there the cost of the AI models themselves to consider, but the data center infrastructure necessary to maintain them.\nMeta has already created its large language model Meta AI (Llama) AI system, which is recognized as one of the top AI systems in the world -- but this is just the beginning. As CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted, \"We're investing and scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\nAs a result, Meta increased its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous expectations of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, \"We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.\" Meta also expects capital spending to be even higher in 2025 as it works to capture the AI opportunity.\nSo what does this have to do with Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet? The common thread that weaves these tech stalwarts together is their AI aspirations, and each of the three has also been spending heavily in order to reap the rewards of AI. Fair-weather investors took Meta's AI announcement as an indication that big tech's AI-induced spending spree will negatively impact results -- but we don't yet have evidence to suggest that's the case.\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are scheduled to report their quarterly results after market close today, and Amazon is up next week, so some investors were selling preemptively in the event these stocks might sell off as well. Investors with a long-term outlook, however, will recognize that this is just the beginning of a multiyear profit opportunity, and volatility is the cost of admission.\nCompany-specific news for our trio of stocks was decidedly mixed:\nUBS analyst Stephen Ju maintained a buy rating on Amazon stock, but raised his price target to $215, which suggests 22% upside compared to Wednesday's closing price. The analyst sees potential for improvement in a broad cross-section of Amazon's business interests this year. This follows two price target increases by other analysts yesterday.\nChinese hackers accessed U.S. government emails last year, something Microsoft could have prevented, according to a report by the Cyber Safety Review Board. The company has lost face and is working to rebuild trust in its systems, according to numerous reports.\nThe potential for a TikTok ban, which was signed into law today by President Biden, could benefit Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet, according to a report in The Washington Post.\nInvestors would do well to step back and look at the big picture when it comes to AI. Analysts at Goldman Sachs\u00a0Research suggest that as AI makes its way into business systems and the rest of society, it could generate as much as $7 trillion over the next 10 years. That's quite a windfall for the companies positioned to participate, which include Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms.\nWhen viewed in the context of this significant opportunity, their valuations are compelling. Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are selling for 33 times, 23 times, and 22 times forward earnings, respectively, while Amazon is trading for roughly 2 times forward sales. Furthermore, all four stocks have easily outpaced the performance of the S&P 500 over the past five years.\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all industry leaders on the cutting edge of AI. Investors should ignore the short-term volatility and buy the dip.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has\u00a0more than tripled\u00a0the market.*\nThey just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now\u2026 and Microsoft made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\nSee the 10 stocks\n*Stock Advisor returns as of April 22, 2024\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "Text": "The speed with which artificial intelligence (AI) caught on last year took many investors by surprise, and it sparked a changing of the guard among the ranks of the world's most valuable companies. Apple was finally dethroned by Microsoft, which now tops the list as the only company that currently has a market cap of more than $3 trillion. Nvidia, fueled by its industry-leading AI processors, has tripled over the past year to take the No. 3 spot, behind Apple with $2.6 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms are all major players in the AI revolution and also members of this auspicious fraternity.\nWith a market cap of just $53 billion (as of this writing), it might seem like hyperbole to suggest that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, could make a run at the $1 trillion club. However, the accelerating demand for AI-centric servers and the company's decades of expertise suggest that Supermicro is a dark horse candidate in the race.\nWhile Supermicro has been creating customized server solutions for more than 30 years, the company was working in relative obscurity until the accelerating adoption of AI kicked off. It turns out that Supermicro has amassed quite a pedigree out of the glare of the spotlight.\nSupermicro has built its reputation by providing highly customizable, energy-efficient, liquid-cooled rack-scale servers designed to handle the rigors of AI and hyperscale data centers. The company has developed strong working relationships and works hand-in-hand with all the top AI chipmakers to ensure its rack-scale servers are top performers while also providing energy efficiency and the lowest total cost of ownership in the industry. It boasts partnerships with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others.\nThis is a winning strategy that has its AI-centric servers flying off the shelves. For its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), Supermicro's revenue surged 103% year over year to $3.7 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $5.10 jumped 85%. Management is forecasting its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year guidance to $14.5 billion, which would represent growth of 104%.\nManagement reports that Supermicro grew five times faster than the industry average over the preceding 12 months, suggesting the company is stealing market share from its rivals. Analysts at Northland agree, suggesting the company has increased its market share to 11%, leaving \"plenty of room for future share gains.\"\nSupermicro is in an enviable position among AI server makers. The company is small enough to be nimble and has a long history of providing customized server solutions to enterprises. Furthermore, the strong and enduring relationships Supermicro has forged with chipmakers give it the inside track and an abundant supply of the processors used for AI. Despite those advantages and the clear opportunity, a lot will have to go right for Supermicro to join the ranks of the trillionaires.\nAccording to Wall Street, Supermicro is poised to generate revenue of $14.7 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 3.6. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $275 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. To be clear, the company is currently ramping up production to support annual sales of $25 billion, so revenue of that magnitude is still a ways off.\nIf the company were able to keep up its triple-digit, year-over-year growth, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap threshold by 2031. That said, it's unlikely the company will keep up its current rate of parabolic growth. If we cut its revenue growth rate assumption to 50%, Supermicro could potentially reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2035.\nThere's reason to believe strong demand for AI-centric servers will continue. BofA analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya suggests the data center market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% over the next three years, and Supermicro's revenue could grow even faster.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang is equally bullish, suggesting that the installed base of data centers will double to $2 trillion over the coming four to five years.\nIf Supermicro captures even a small part of that vast opportunity, the company will soon join the $1 trillion club.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 11, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Nvidia NVDA, Super Micro Computer SMCI, and Arm Holdings ARM.\nOn Wall Street, innovation leads to earnings growth, and earnings growth which eventually leads to higher equity prices. In late 2022, OpenAI, which counts tech behemoth Microsoft as its largest investor, sparked the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution with the release of its \"chatbot\" ChatGPT. ChatGPT, which leverages a large language model (LLM), allows users to get answers to almost any question in the world instantly.\nThough artificial intelligence has been around for decades, ChatGPT was the first proof of concept, becoming the fastest consumer app to reach the milestone of 100 million users and sparking other tech companies like Alphabet to rush in and enter the AI fray.\nUndoubtedly, investors have enjoyed a bull market over the past year, as evidenced by rising equities and a breakout to new highs, strong earnings, and broad-based participation. Like most bull markets, the stocks with the most robust growth are the ones that lead. In this market, artificial intelligence-related stocks are clearly the industry leading the way. In a recent podcast, Elon Musk said, \"AI is the fastest advancing technology I've seen of any kind, and I've seen a lot of technology.\" Though I am far from a technologist, I have been around Wall Street for multiple decades, and I, too, have not witnessed this type of earnings growth.\nAfter a tremendous move, AI-related names such as Nvidia,Super Micro Computer, Arm Holdings are finally retreating as inflation worries spook U.S. investors after a hotter-than-expected CPI reading.\nWhether you caught or missed the move in AI-related stocks, now is the time to revisit them. Below are three important reasons why, including:\nAs I have said before, institutional investors tend to defend the intermediate-term 10-week moving average in bull markets, and the area historically provides a fantastic reward-to-risk ratio for investors. For example, shares of NVDA, which trended from $500 in January to nearly $1,000 per share, are retreating uniformly to their 10-week moving average.\nAs the race to AI dominance intensifies, Wall Street sees earnings growth in several AI-related names gaining momentum. For instance, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest that Super Micro Computer will grow quarterly earnings by triple digits over the next two quarters, which is not too shabby for a $50 billion company.\nA lack of selling after a monstrous gain is a simple yet effective signal that bulls are not rushing to part with shares. ARM shares exploded 62% after reporting monstrous earnings in February. Since then, shares have digested those gains and have held the earnings gains entirely \u2013 a sign that bulls are in control.\nAmateur investors often hope for a pullback but never pull the trigger when it occurs. That said, a pullback in AI stocks may offer a juicy reward-to-risk zone to take advantage of.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Billionaire David Tepper Sold Nvidia and Alphabet Shares Hand Over Fist Last Quarter. Here Are the \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks He Bought Instead.",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Billionaire David Tepper made quite a name for himself on Wall Street. He helms Appaloosa Management -- the hedge fund he founded back in 1993. He has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation\" and also consistently outperforms his peers.\nHe correctly predicted the collapse of the housing market and the resulting financial crisis that led to the Great Recession in 2008. He also loaded up on bank stocks at the depths of the downturn, a strategy that eventually turned a significant profit for Appaloosa investors. With a resume like that, it's no wonder that many investors follow his moves with keen interest.\nIt raised some eyebrows when Tepper significantly reduced his stakes in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) in the fourth quarter while opting to increase his stakes in two other members of the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nIn the fourth quarter, Tepper made some big changes to the upper echelons of Appaloosa's portfolio, cutting his stake in Nvidia by 23%. He obviously still sees upside in the stock, as the hedge fund still owns 790,000 shares worth an estimated $678 million). And Nvidia is still Appaloosa's fourth-largest holding at nearly 7% of the portfolio.\nThe sale was likely a calculated move on Tepper's part. After all, Nvidia gained 239% last year and was selling for 65 times earnings and 27 times sales, so its valuation was steep.\nTepper also slashed his stake in Alphabet stock by 16%, though it remains the fund's seventh-largest holding. Appaloosa now owns 2.3 million shares worth about $388 million.\nIn this case, though, there's no obvious catalyst explaining his decision to sell. The stock was still reasonably priced at year's end, trading for 24 times earnings. He may have had concerns about the timing of the rebound in the digital ad market -- which is responsible for the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue -- or questions about how AI will ultimately impact Google's near monopoly in search.\nIn moves that aren't too surprising, Tepper added to his existing stakes in two of Appaloosa's top three holdings, as he's apparently still bullish on their prospects.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) cemented its place as the hedge fund's No. 2 holding as Tepper increased his stake by 4%. This brought the total count to 1.7 million shares currently worth roughly $710 million, or 11.3% of Appaloosa's holdings. Microsoft arguably kick-started the AI revolution when it invested in Chat-GPT creator OpenAI and integrated generative AI capabilities across a broad cross-section of its workplace productivity tools.\nThe biggest opportunity, however, is likely Copilot, its AI-powered digital assistant. Microsoft debuted a number of job-specific versions of Copilot that help automate otherwise time-consuming tasks. The company gained cloud market share, the result of strong demand for its AI tools.\nMicrosoft stock was selling for a slight premium of 34 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, but given its quick move into the AI marketplace and the potential for profits, that valuation is more than reasonable.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was the second of Tepper's Magnificent Seven purchases. He increased his holdings by 5%, bringing Appaloosa's total stake to 3.95 million shares. At their current value of about $711 million, they account for 11% of the portfolio. As the undisputed cloud infrastructure leader, Amazon has a captive audience for its AI products and services.\nThe company released a bevy of helpful tools on its e-commerce platform to streamline the processes of selling goods and buying advertising. Furthermore, Amazon has a long history of managing its online retail business in part with AI systems, which help it maintain adequate inventory levels, surface relevant recommendations, schedule more efficient delivery routes, and more.\nAnd with the stock trading at less than 3 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, Amazon was a steal.\nSo far, Tepper's results from these moves have been mixed. Nvidia stock gained 80% so far this year, which has kept it in its position as the undisputed champion among the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet stock is up 11%. Over the same period, Amazon and Microsoft have gained 20% and 12%, respectively. This suggests that Tepper would have been better off had he not made any changes at all to his allocations to these stocks.\nThere's a lesson here for investors. If the investing thesis for one of your holdings hasn't changed -- even if the stock sports a nosebleed valuation -- it's sometimes best to stay the course. The AI revolution has just started, and while competition is ramping up, Nvidia's AI processors are still the best in the business. And Alphabet has a long track record of successfully deploying AI algorithms to further its business objectives, and there's no evidence to suggest that this time will be any different.\nInfluential economist John Maynard Keynes reportedly said, \"Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\" Applied to this case, I take that to mean it's best not to make investing decisions based on what the broader market is expected to do, but rather to focus on a company's prospects.\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-04-29, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $185.66. It's currently trading at a price of $171.95. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 7.38%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$5.94\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.63%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 21.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n102.56\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n106.93\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n185.66\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $166.94. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -3%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) minted its first $1 trillion company last year when Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock soared 239%, thanks to unprecedented demand for its AI data center chips. Nvidia continues to create value, and it's now worth $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world behind Apple and Microsoft.\nThe trillion-dollar club is incredibly exclusive, with Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms being the only other members. However, another company might be poised to join the ranks within the next decade.\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is an emerging challenger to Nvidia in the market for AI chips. The company is valued at just $270 billion as of this writing, so investors who buy the stock today could see a gain of 270% if it does eventually join the trillion-dollar club. Here's why I think it will.\nLast year AMD unveiled its MI300 lineup of data center chips designed to process AI workloads. They come in two configurations: The MI300X is a pure GPU that competes with Nvidia's H100, and the MI300A combines GPU and CPU hardware to form an accelerated processing unit (APU).\nConsidering Nvidia can't keep up with demand for its chips, the door is open for competitors like AMD to snatch market share. In the fourth quarter of 2023 (ended Dec. 31, 2023), AMD told investors it was working with tech giants like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta on MI300 GPU deployments for AI. Microsoft has already begun private previews with customers for the MI300X on its Azure cloud computing platform, where developers can access advanced AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4.\nAMD predicts the MI300 series could attract $3.5 billion in sales in 2024. That forecast was revised higher from $2 billion just three months earlier, which speaks to how quickly demand is building. Nvidia did $47.5 billion in data center revenue last fiscal year, driven mostly by its H100, so there is still plenty of room for AMD to grow.\nHowever, AMD's opportunity in AI transcends the data center. It already has a 90% market share in chips for AI-enabled personal computers, led by its Ryzen AI series, which includes CPUs, GPUs, and neural processing units (NPUs). The company says millions of AI PCs have already shipped with those chips, from manufacturers like Dell, Lenovo, Asus, and HP Inc.\nProcessing AI on-device results in a faster user experience, because workloads don't have to travel to and from the data center. That allows computers to host advanced virtual assistants capable of creating text content, images, and videos potentially without any network connection. Ryzen AI chips sent AMD's Client segment revenue soaring 62% year over year during Q4, and investors should watch for more rapid growth in the upcoming first quarter of 2024.\nThe semiconductor industry is cyclical, which means growth is sometimes lumpy from year to year. Consumers don't upgrade expensive products like computers and smartphones annually, which leads to an occasional lull in revenue growth for companies like AMD.\nFor example, AMD's revenue soared 44% in 2022 to $23.6 billion, but it came in at $22.7 billion in 2023, which was a 4% year-over-year decline. High inflation and rising interest rates didn't help, because they piled additional pressure on consumer spending.\nCommercial spending on the data center presents the same challenge. Tech giants like Microsoft normally don't upgrade their hardware every year; however, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes AI will change that in the near term. He says $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure will be upgraded within four years to meet demand for accelerated computing and AI, which could drive a significant growth cycle for his company and the likes of AMD.\nWall Street analysts are forecasting $25.8 billion in 2024 revenue for AMD, which will represent growth of 14%. They also predict $32.5 billion in 2025 revenue, which would be an accelerated growth rate of 26%. However, considering AMD recently lifted its own forecast for MI300 sales by such a wide margin, combined with its soaring sales in AI-enabled computer chips, it's possible the company blows Wall Street's numbers out of the water.\nAfter all, Nvidia routinely beats expectations in the data center, and AMD's MI300 sales are only just starting to ramp up.\nAMD is currently valued at $270 billion, and based on its $22.7 billion in 2023 revenue, its stock trades at a price to sales (P/S) ratio of 11.9. If that P/S ratio remains constant, AMD will have to generate $84 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation.\nThe company could get there within a decade if it grows revenue by a relatively modest 14% each year between now and 2034. AMD appears likely to meet the threshold comfortably in the near term based on the Street's forecasts for 2024 and 2025.\nPlus, despite the lumpiness in its yearly results, AMD's revenue has grown at a compound annual rate of 15.6% over the last 10 years -- and that's without AI, which could be the company's largest opportunity ever.\nMultiple expansion is also a possibility. If AMD's revenue grows much faster than analysts expect, investors could be willing to pay a higher P/S ratio for the stock. Nvidia stock, for example, trades at a P/S ratio of 35.8 -- triple where AMD stock is trading. That would accelerate the company's path to a $1 trillion valuation.\nAMD is a very likely candidate to join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the trillion-dollar club, and investors who buy the stock today could earn a significant gain when it gets there.\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

It's probably one of the most difficult AI projects actually to work on and so autonomy is something that's incredibly exciting for us, but we'll see where it takes us.\"\nDon't Miss:\nInvest alongside exec\u2019s from Uber, Facebook and Apple in this wellness app Transforming a $5.6 TRILLION dollar industry.\nThis Uber-for-moving startup is quietly taking the world by storm, here\u2019s how anyone can invest for a limited time.\nThe tech giant officially halted the project in February and last week reportedly laid off 600 employees from its self-driving car project, signaling the end of its efforts in this area.\nDespite investing billions of dollars over 12 years, the company faced difficulties entering the automotive space, while competitors have made significant progress.\nAlphabet\u2019s Waymo has been a leader in self-driving technology.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s exciting is the progress for the amount we\u2019ve had \u2014 when I look at the next six months, 12 months, 18 months, it looks like there\u2019s going to be a lot more progress there.

The company has partnered with Uber Technologies Inc. to offer autonomous rides and food delivery in Phoenix.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk announced on X that the company's robotaxis are set to be unveiled in August. Musk first mentioned a fully autonomous car in 2019, when he said, \"By the middle of next year, we'll have over a million Tesla cars on the road with full self-driving hardware.\"\nWhile Tesla did not achieve that goal, it offers an advanced driver assistance system with Autopilot and a premium full self-driving option.\nRead About Startup Investing:\nRetail invested +$2 million in this tech-forward startup taking on a $272 billion industry.\nAnyone can invest in this Harvard-founded AI startup solving paywalls and growing 5x yearly by partnering with Forbes, Daily News and more.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Elon Musk Challenges Alphabet With Tesla's Robo Taxis As Apple Exits The Self-Driving Car Race After Wasting Billions originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "Including dividends, the Nasdaq Composite Index has produced a total return of 103% (as of April 19) in the past five years. This means your capital would have effectively doubled, which is a fantastic gain.\nBut you should know that Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), one of world's dominant internet firms, has significantly exceeded that benchmark's gain. If you had invested $1,000 in this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock five years ago, you'd have more than $2,500 today. That's a stellar 151% return.\nLet's look closer at Alphabet.\nThis stock has done so well for investors primarily because of how the underlying business has consistently grown sales and income. Between 2018 and 2023, the company's revenue and diluted earnings per share increased at compound annual rates of 17.6% and 21.6%, respectively. It's no wonder shareholders were rewarded.\nThis points to how investing doesn't have to be complicated at all. Great returns can be achieved by buying and holding the best businesses out there. It's also important to be able to hold on to your winners.\nPast performance never guarantees future results, but I do believe Alphabet will continue to perform well for its investors. Even after that remarkable five-year gain, shares trade at a very reasonable forward P/E ratio of 22.8. That's a cheaper multiple than every other \"Magnificent Seven\" stock.\nJust because a company generated $307 billion in sales last year and carries a massive market cap of $1.9 trillion doesn't mean its gains will be limited. In this instance, it's very easy to be optimistic.\nAlphabet benefits from the growth of the digital advertising, streaming entertainment, and cloud computing markets. They all have huge expansion runways in the decades ahead, making the stock a worthy investment candidate right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 12, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, Coinbase COIN, MicroStrategy MSTR and Alphabet's GOOGL.\nBitcoin is having another classic year of outperformance versus other asset classes. However, the bull market is far from over. Below are five catalysts that will drive the world's largest cryptocurrency past $100k, including:\nInstitutional adoption, the moment Bitcoin enthusiasts have waited for, is here. The Bitcoin ETF launch, which occurred earlier this year, was the most successful in history. ETFs such as the iShares Bitcoin Trust have attracted billions in inflows and have gained more than 70% since debuting. That said, the ETF debut has not only helped ETF operators and Bitcoin itself, but it has also led to massive earnings in the exchange custodian for these ETFs, Coinbase.\nMeanwhile, MicroStrategy has soared nearly 1,000% (not a typo) in five years after adopting the \"Bitcoin standard.\" Finally, El Salvador is benefitting from purchasing millions in Bitcoin, Fidelity (one of the world's largest asset managers) owns Bitcoin, and a European Bitcoin ETF is likely to be launched soon. Bitcoin adoption is here and is insatiable. The only question left to ask is, \"Who will be next?\"\nWhile demand is likely to soar, supply will be constrained in 2024 due to the next \"Bitcoin Halving\" in April. A Bitcoin halving is an event that occurs approximately every four years, reducing the reward miners receive for validating and adding new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain by half. One of the virtues of Bitcoin is its built-in \"anti-inflationary\" monetary policy.\nThe reduction in the rate at which new Bitcoins are created leads to a gradual decrease in the overall supply of newly minted Bitcoins. Though the number of halvings in Bitcoin's history is only three, and history is no guarantor, the stats suggest that bulls should stay the course for at least the next year. Bitcoin has delivered at least triple-digit one year after the halving, including +7,715% in 2012/13, +283% in 2016/17, and +423% in 2020/21!\nEquity investors often leverage historical seasonality trends to gain in edge in the market. Like with equities, investors can look to history to identify historical trends. For Bitcoin, the presidential election years (like the one we are in now) have been incredibly bullish. In the past three election years, Bitcoin returns were as follows: 2012 +272.4%, 2016 +161.1%, and 2020 +302.8%. \nInvestors often overcomplicate technical analysis, utilizing fancy indicators and ultimately suffering from \"paralysis by analysis.\" However, with Bitcoin, simplicity has paid dividends and has allowed investors to block out the day-to-day volatility and noise. Bitcoin is breaking out to fresh all-time highs for the first time in years. Each time these multi-year breakouts have occurred, Bitcoin has produced meteoric returns.\nOver the past year, Bitcoin is up some 131.72%, sparked the most successful ETF debut in Wall Street history, and broke out to new all-time highs. Nevertheless, Alphabet's \"Google Trends,\" which measures the number of searches for a particular keyword, paints a much different picture than most investors would expect. First, artificial intelligence (AI) searches far supersede Bitcoin searches. Second, Bitcoin searches are about 75% lower than they were when the world's first cryptocurrency peaked back in 2017. In other words, despite the bullish price action, there are few signs of \"overexuberance.\"\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.
