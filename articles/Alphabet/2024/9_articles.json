However, the analyst noted limited upside to both Street estimates and valuation multiples in the next 12-18 months.\nGoogle\u2019s core Search revenue growth has accelerated over the last five quarters to exceed +15% in constant currency in the second quarter. As per the analyst, while growth should decelerate from here, Search should steadily benefit from query volume growth and monetization gains over the next few years.\nHe said that share loss to competition, directly and indirectly, appears minimal so far. Early feedback on generative AI User experience\u00a0(UX) appears positive and enables Google to mitigate use-case erosion.\nAccording to fundamentals, the core search business has several levers to grow, plus double digits in fiscals 2024 and 2025, Mathivanan writes.\nHowever, recent regulatory setbacks bring plenty of medium-long-term uncertainties while search UX\u00a0transforms with expensive AI deployments.\nAdditionally, fiscal 2023 EPS growth will likely face headwinds from accelerating infrastructure costs and headcount additions.\nGoogle stock is currently trading at 19x fiscal 2025 EPS, a discount to mega-cap peers, which he noted as unlikely to change while near-term regulatory and AI-related uncertainties linger. Mathivanan projects third-quarter revenue of $85.5 billion and EPS of $1.86.\nWedbush: On September 9, the second antitrust trial against Google in 2024 will commence in the U.S. District Court, Devitt noted.\nThe U.S. DOJ complaint primarily focuses on Google\u2019s ad tech stack, specifically Google Ad Manager. Devitt flagged the DOJ\u2019s complaint proposing the divestiture of the Google Ad Manager Suite but does not identify other areas of the ad tech stack as specific targets for divestiture.\nThe analyst noted that Google Ad Manager represented only 4.1% of revenue and 1.5% of the operating profit of the consolidated Alphabet business in 2020.\nWhile the analyst acknowledged near-term headline risk associated with the pending trial, he noted the overall risk to the industry is limited based on the company\u2019s recent financial disclosures related to its ad tech products.\nPrice Action: GOOGL stock is up 0.20% at $156.77 at the last check on Thursday.\nImage via Shutterstock\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nFeb 2022\nMKM Partners\nMaintains\nBuy\nFeb 2022\nMizuho\nMaintains\nBuy\nFeb 2022\nPiper Sandler\nMaintains\nOverweight\nView More Analyst Ratings for GOOGL\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nALPHABET (GOOGL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Alphabet Remains Core Tech Bet But Regulatory Risks and AI Uncertainties Loom: Analysts originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Author": "  Wright's Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has recently seen its shares trade off from $193 to $158, representing a more than an 18% drop, as investors have arguably been discounting both competitive and regulatory pressures the company is currently facing.\nWe think this recent decline is largely exaggerated and that the stock is starting to get cheap again, both fundamentally and relative to industry peers. In addition, we also think investors may be discounting and overlooking the Google parent's moat relative to other big tech players, which are trading at significantly higher valuations. Finally, we look at the risks to our thesis and what investors should be aware of when looking at the stock.\nOne thing we think is often overlooked when analyzing Alphabet is the qualitative aspect of how much moat the company actually has. While it is easy to judge Apple's iPhone moat and ecosystem, Google has done a pretty good job of being a stronghold for consumers in multiple domains, with some services seen as very essential.\nIn fact, we believe consumers would find it difficult to see a world without Alphabet's ecosystem, which ranges from Gmail, Android, Google Cloud, Google Drive, Google Meet, YouTube, Google Maps and Google News, to name a few. In addition, after all these years, we think the company has created a very strong brand loyalty among its users, most of whom choose Google Chrome as their default web browser even when presented with another choice.\nEarlier this year, in March, new rules went into effect in the European Union, allowing users to choose which default browser to use, but this did not seem to have a substantial impact on Google's market share, which is another sign of its strong brand loyalty. We believe that even if Google is ordered to stop making payments to other companies, such as $20 billion to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for using Google Search as the default Web browser, it probably would not hurt Alphabet as much as it would hurt the other companies in question.\nIn general, just the data advantage Alphabet currently has over competitors, as well as the perceived accuracy advantage they seemingly have with Google Search, seems to be a dealbreaker for many users. Regardless, Google Search remains Alphabet's bread and butter, with the segment accounting for more than 57% of total revenue.\nAnother reason we think the company's moat is undervalued is the fact some of Google's business units, such as YouTube, could be worth more than publicly traded top-tier competitors. For example, YouTube ads alone pulled in $7.67 billion in ad revenue in the second quarter, compared with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which earned $9.56 billion in revenue last quarter. YouTube, on the other hand, has 2.7 billion active users versus Netflix, which has 277.65 million active subscribers.\nMoreover, we think YouTube is just at the beginning of monetizing its user base with YouTube Premium. In general, it would be quite conservative to give YouTube a rating similar to Netflix's, even though the number of minutes watched annually on YouTube is significantly higher than Netflix. Netflix, on the other hand, is currently trading with a market cap of $292 billion. And while many pointed out that YouTube's revenue this quarter fell short of expectations by $8.67 billion, or 13.02% year over year, revenue from Google Subscriptions, which includes the strong growth of YouTube Premium, rose 14.37% year over year to $9.31 billion.\nGoogle Cloud is also gaining momentum, with operating income up $395 million to $1.17 billion, while margins increased from 9.40% last quarter to 11.30% this quarter.\nOne of the most attractive features of Alphabet among big tech players, more specifically the Magnificent Seven, is the fact it is the cheapest of them all at certain valuations. On an enterprise value/Ebit basis, for example, the stock trades at only a ratio of 18.37, compared to other Magnificent Seven companies that typically trade at a multiple of at least 20 to 35 times.\nOverall, also looking at forward-looking estimates, Alphabet is trading at a mere 15.82 times 2026 forward price-earnings, against an expected $10.01 earnings per share. Moreover, the company has a massive $100.73 billion buffer of cash on its balance sheet. However, we noticed quite a difference between the figures in the income statement and free cash flow.\nFor example, if we look at operating income on a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow usually follows operating income pretty closely. In this case, we looked at free cash flow net of stock-based compensation. As you can see, as of the third quarter of 2023, adjusted free cash flow is significantly lower than normal compared to operating income. This difference is mainly due to higher investments due to spending on hardware for AI infrastructure, as well as changes in accounting from 2023, extending the life of their servers and hardware from four to five years to six years. With respect to the significant investments in AI infrastructure, it also remains to be seen whether this will translate into future flows of free cash flow.\nAnother key benefit for Alphabet investors is the fact it has used almost all of its free cash flow and sometimes some of its cash reserves to return capital to investors in the form of share repurchases. On a trailing 12-month basis, the company has repurchased $63.36 billion worth of shares while generating $60.79 billion in free cash flow. Outside of innovation in AI models, Alphabet is still going strong with initiatives such as Waymo, expanding its autonomous car fleet and recently partnering with Uber (NYSE:UBER) to integrate with existing Uber customers.\nHowever, there are risks to our bullish thesis as there are some macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds to keep in mind. First, in terms of legislative risks, Google is under scrutiny from several angles, both in the EU and in the United States, mainly regarding antitrust issues. In the United States, a judge recently ruled that Google Search is a monopoly, with the current lawsuit, with the plaintiff's request to have the company at least sell Google Ad Manager, ongoing, according to a report.\nIn the EU, the company just lost its appeal against a $2.42 billion fine over its comparison shopping service. Alphabet is also fighting two other fines around Google's practices with Android and the Google AdSense platform. The way we see these issues is that most of these rulings are likely to take several years to resolve, especially if it appeals. Moreover, by the time there is a ruling, Google may have enough competition from AI, for example with OpenAI's SearchGPT over ads. The company should also be able to easily pay these fines with the huge amounts of free cash flow it generates, as highlighted earlier.\nThe biggest problems we believe Alphabet may face in the short to medium term are at the macroeconomic level. First, the yield curve, more specifically the spread between the two-year and 10-year yields, is back in positive territory after being deeply inverted for about two years, which is a strong indicator that a recession is likely near. The Sahm Rule, which indicates the change in unemployment, also recently crossed the 0.50 threshold and currently stands at 0.57. At 0.57, a recession is usually imminent. Previous times when this value reached 0.57, there was always a recession.\nWhile many investors will view the recent announcement of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve positively, we want to remind people that interest rate cuts are reactive and not preventive. Usually, when interest rates are cut, unemployment has already risen dramatically and the United States is already in recession, with stock indexes down significantly. In addition, we would also be wary of insider trading in recent years with Alphabet, given that there have been almost no insider purchases and quite a few insider sales by management and directors.\nIn conclusion, we think Alphabet is getting cheap on both a fundamental, historical and relative basis, with the stock likely trading at a discount to other big tech companies due to what we see as overblown competitive and regulatory pressures. We also think investors are discounting or overlooking Google's moat in several areas.\nIn reality, Alphabet is not just another search engine, but a company that has a huge data advantage over its competitors and is able to provide a far superior service, as evidenced by the fact it did not lose material market share in the EU following a decision to let consumers decide which browser to use. The main downside that we think investors should consider at this time is on the macroeconomic front, where we think a recession is very near and could negatively impact Alphabet in the short to medium term. Finally, we would also pay attention to the widening gap between free cash flow and operating income in upcoming earnings reports.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Bullish on Alphabet, as Cloud Computing Is the New Growth Engine for the Stock",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) stock has recovered quite nicely from the deep selloff it endured near the end of 2022, as its advertising channels continue to consistently deliver big numbers. While Alphabet still heavily depends on ad sales, the company\u2019s new growth engine is Google Cloud. I\u2019m bullish on both parts of the business, but Google Cloud offers more upside potential as the tech giant continues to gain ground on its peers.\nAd revenue carries the bulk of the revenue load at Google, having generated $64.6 billion for the\u00a0second quarter of 2024. That\u2019s an increase of 11.1% year-over-year. Google Search and YouTube ads revenue jumped by 13.8% and 13.0% year-over-year, respectively.\u00a0A bullish investor can take comfort in these numbers.\nGrowth in this segment is\u00a0good\u00a0for Alphabet\u2019s profit margins, as the advertising segment is known for having high margins. Alphabet wrapped up the second quarter with a 27.9% net profit margin. Those margins will likely increase as the company delivers operational efficiencies including from cost cutting. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see the company record a 30% net profit margin in at least one quarter in 2025 as profitability grows.\nAlphabet put itself in the spotlight when it announced its first dividend earlier this year. The yield is roughly 0.50%, and Alphabet will likely strive to make a further impression with a double-digit dividend hike in 2025.\nThe results of Alphabet\u2019s advertising division alone could make GOOGL stock attractive, but Google Cloud offers another reason to be bullish. This part of Alphabet\u2019s business is growing much faster than its advertising segment, and it\u2019s no longer a small offshoot like in previous years. Google Cloud revenue reached $10.4 billion in Q2, representing more than 12% of total revenue for the quarter.\nGoogle Cloud\u2019s impact on future earnings reports will grow, and that\u2019s good news for investors. Cloud revenue jumped by 28.8% year-over-year. That growth rate has been normal for Google Cloud, and its profitability is also improving. Google Cloud\u2019s operating income almost tripled year-over-year, going from $395 million to $1.17 billion. Cloud profit margins have the potential to soar quickly, and the accelerated growth from this part of Alphabet\u2019s business suggests higher profit margins are awaiting patient investors.\nAlphabet has a dominant position in artificial intelligence, a\u00a0critical technology that can accelerate advertising and cloud revenue. The tech giant\u2019s AI capabilities make me bullish. Alphabet is using AI to run better ads that maximize results for its customers. This will incentivize more ad spend as companies continue to invest in the marketing channels that drive the most results. Artificial intelligence has also strengthened Google Cloud\u2019s core offering. Additionally, the intense bandwidth necessary for AI has also prompted more businesses to use Google Cloud.\nArtificial intelligence is still in its early innings. The industry is projected to achieve\u00a0annualized growth of 19.3% from now until 2034, according to Precedence Research. Alphabet is one of the leaders in software for companies looking to capitalize on artificial intelligence, and that should drive accelerating revenue growth from Google Cloud. The tech giant\u2019s AI capabilities make me bullish, as they have sparked accelerated growth across its underlying companies.\nAlphabet, Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), three of the largest companies in town, are all heavily focused on cloud computing. Together, these companies have helped pace the stock market in recent years.\nIn terms of relative valuation, Alphabet trades at a 23.4 P/E ratio, which is a lower valuation than for MSFT stock or AMZN stock. Microsoft carries a 36.5x P/E ratio, while Amazon\u2019s multiple stands at 46.4x. Google\u2019s relative valuation appeal makes it easier to be bullish on the stock. Alphabet has higher profit margins than Amazon and a higher net income growth rate than Microsoft.\nGoogle Cloud\u00a0also\u00a0grew faster than Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Cloud in the second quarter. While Google Cloud revenue increased by 28.8% year-over-year, Amazon Web Services only registered 19% year-over-year revenue growth. Microsoft Cloud fared slightly better with 21% year-over-year revenue growth, but both of those growth rates trail what Alphabet delivered. If Alphabet continues to gain market share in cloud computing, I predict the stock will perform well.\nWall Street analysts currently hold a consensus Strong Buy rating on shares of GOOGL. From the 37 analysts covering the Alphabet stock, 28 offer Buy ratings while 9 have Hold ratings. No Wall Street analysts rate GOOGL stock a Sell. The average price target for GOOGL is $201.44, implying nearly 25% potential upside.\nAlphabet has been a leading stock in recent years and has outperformed the S&P 500. While advertising revenue has historically been the driver of GOOGL, Google Cloud is the next captivating growth opportunity. Alphabet\u2019s cloud platform growth is outpacing ad revenue growth and gaining ground on AWS and Microsoft Cloud. I\u2019m bullish on GOOGL stock, especially with an undemanding 23.4 P/E ratio.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has announced a $3.3bn investment to establish two new data centre campuses in South Carolina, the US.\nThe move aims to expand the tech giant\u2019s digital services infrastructure, mainly supporting products such as Google Search, Cloud, and Maps.\nThe investment is expected to generate hundreds of new jobs across Dorchester and Berkeley counties.\nThe new Dorchester County campuses will be located in the Pine Hill Business Campus in Ridgeville and Winding Woods Commerce Park in St. George.\nWith a $2bn investment, these facilities are projected to create 200 new operational jobs.\nThey are designed to meet the increasing demand for the company's cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\nIn addition to the new sites, Google will invest an additional $1.3bn to expand its existing data centre campus in Berkeley County.\nThe expansion of the Mount Holly Commerce Park in Moncks Corner will bolster job growth and enhance the company's existing operations, which began in 2007 as Google's first venture in South Carolina.\nGoogle global Cloud Supply Chain and Operations vice president Monique Picou said: \u201cToday marks a significant milestone in Google\u2019s collaboration with South Carolina. Our continued investment is a testament to the state\u2019s exceptional workforce and thriving business environment.\n\u201cGoogle data centres are the backbone of digital services that underpin our modern lives, along with tech innovation like AI. We\u2019re grateful for the collaboration with leaders in the state to not only grow our digital infrastructure here but contribute to this thriving community.\u201d\nReuters reported that Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai emphasised the importance of such investments at a time when companies are heavily investing in AI application development infrastructure.\nIn July 2024, Alphabet disclosed a capital expenditure of $13bn for the June quarter and indicated that its quarterly capital expenditure for the remainder of 2024 would be at or above $12bn.\nOther tech giants are also focusing on AI infrastructure. Microsoft recently announced a partnership with BlackRock and Abu Dhabi-backed investment firm MGX to launch a fund exceeding $30bn.\nThis fund is dedicated to investing in AI infrastructure, including the construction of data centres and energy projects.\n\"Alphabet invests $3.3bn in two new data centres in South Carolina\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 21.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n128.67\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n145.15\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n242.28\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $163.10. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -0.52%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has recently seen its shares trade off from $193 to $158, representing a more than an 18% drop, as investors have arguably been discounting both competitive and regulatory pressures the company is currently facing.\nWe think this recent decline is largely exaggerated and that the stock is starting to get cheap again, both fundamentally and relative to industry peers. In addition, we also think investors may be discounting and overlooking the Google parent's moat relative to other big tech players, which are trading at significantly higher valuations. Finally, we look at the risks to our thesis and what investors should be aware of when looking at the stock.\nOne thing we think is often overlooked when analyzing Alphabet is the qualitative aspect of how much moat the company actually has. While it is easy to judge Apple's iPhone moat and ecosystem, Google has done a pretty good job of being a stronghold for consumers in multiple domains, with some services seen as very essential.\nIn fact, we believe consumers would find it difficult to see a world without Alphabet's ecosystem, which ranges from Gmail, Android, Google Cloud, Google Drive, Google Meet, YouTube, Google Maps and Google News, to name a few. In addition, after all these years, we think the company has created a very strong brand loyalty among its users, most of whom choose Google Chrome as their default web browser even when presented with another choice.\nEarlier this year, in March, new rules went into effect in the European Union, allowing users to choose which default browser to use, but this did not seem to have a substantial impact on Google's market share, which is another sign of its strong brand loyalty. We believe that even if Google is ordered to stop making payments to other companies, such as $20 billion to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for using Google Search as the default Web browser, it probably would not hurt Alphabet as much as it would hurt the other companies in question.\nIn general, just the data advantage Alphabet currently has over competitors, as well as the perceived accuracy advantage they seemingly have with Google Search, seems to be a dealbreaker for many users. Regardless, Google Search remains Alphabet's bread and butter, with the segment accounting for more than 57% of total revenue.\nAnother reason we think the company's moat is undervalued is the fact some of Google's business units, such as YouTube, could be worth more than publicly traded top-tier competitors. For example, YouTube ads alone pulled in $7.67 billion in ad revenue in the second quarter, compared with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which earned $9.56 billion in revenue last quarter. YouTube, on the other hand, has 2.7 billion active users versus Netflix, which has 277.65 million active subscribers.\nMoreover, we think YouTube is just at the beginning of monetizing its user base with YouTube Premium. In general, it would be quite conservative to give YouTube a rating similar to Netflix's, even though the number of minutes watched annually on YouTube is significantly higher than Netflix. Netflix, on the other hand, is currently trading with a market cap of $292 billion. And while many pointed out that YouTube's revenue this quarter fell short of expectations by $8.67 billion, or 13.02% year over year, revenue from Google Subscriptions, which includes the strong growth of YouTube Premium, rose 14.37% year over year to $9.31 billion.\nGoogle Cloud is also gaining momentum, with operating income up $395 million to $1.17 billion, while margins increased from 9.40% last quarter to 11.30% this quarter.\nOne of the most attractive features of Alphabet among big tech players, more specifically the Magnificent Seven, is the fact it is the cheapest of them all at certain valuations. On an enterprise value/Ebit basis, for example, the stock trades at only a ratio of 18.37, compared to other Magnificent Seven companies that typically trade at a multiple of at least 20 to 35 times.\nOverall, also looking at forward-looking estimates, Alphabet is trading at a mere 15.82 times 2026 forward price-earnings, against an expected $10.01 earnings per share. Moreover, the company has a massive $100.73 billion buffer of cash on its balance sheet. However, we noticed quite a difference between the figures in the income statement and free cash flow.\nFor example, if we look at operating income on a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow usually follows operating income pretty closely. In this case, we looked at free cash flow net of stock-based compensation. As you can see, as of the third quarter of 2023, adjusted free cash flow is significantly lower than normal compared to operating income. This difference is mainly due to higher investments due to spending on hardware for AI infrastructure, as well as changes in accounting from 2023, extending the life of their servers and hardware from four to five years to six years. With respect to the significant investments in AI infrastructure, it also remains to be seen whether this will translate into future flows of free cash flow.\nAnother key benefit for Alphabet investors is the fact it has used almost all of its free cash flow and sometimes some of its cash reserves to return capital to investors in the form of share repurchases. On a trailing 12-month basis, the company has repurchased $63.36 billion worth of shares while generating $60.79 billion in free cash flow. Outside of innovation in AI models, Alphabet is still going strong with initiatives such as Waymo, expanding its autonomous car fleet and recently partnering with Uber (NYSE:UBER) to integrate with existing Uber customers.\nHowever, there are risks to our bullish thesis as there are some macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds to keep in mind. First, in terms of legislative risks, Google is under scrutiny from several angles, both in the EU and in the United States, mainly regarding antitrust issues. In the United States, a judge recently ruled that Google Search is a monopoly, with the current lawsuit, with the plaintiff's request to have the company at least sell Google Ad Manager, ongoing, according to a report.\nIn the EU, the company just lost its appeal against a $2.42 billion fine over its comparison shopping service. Alphabet is also fighting two other fines around Google's practices with Android and the Google AdSense platform. The way we see these issues is that most of these rulings are likely to take several years to resolve, especially if it appeals. Moreover, by the time there is a ruling, Google may have enough competition from AI, for example with OpenAI's SearchGPT over ads. The company should also be able to easily pay these fines with the huge amounts of free cash flow it generates, as highlighted earlier.\nThe biggest problems we believe Alphabet may face in the short to medium term are at the macroeconomic level. First, the yield curve, more specifically the spread between the two-year and 10-year yields, is back in positive territory after being deeply inverted for about two years, which is a strong indicator that a recession is likely near. The Sahm Rule, which indicates the change in unemployment, also recently crossed the 0.50 threshold and currently stands at 0.57. At 0.57, a recession is usually imminent. Previous times when this value reached 0.57, there was always a recession.\nWhile many investors will view the recent announcement of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve positively, we want to remind people that interest rate cuts are reactive and not preventive. Usually, when interest rates are cut, unemployment has already risen dramatically and the United States is already in recession, with stock indexes down significantly. In addition, we would also be wary of insider trading in recent years with Alphabet, given that there have been almost no insider purchases and quite a few insider sales by management and directors.\nIn conclusion, we think Alphabet is getting cheap on both a fundamental, historical and relative basis, with the stock likely trading at a discount to other big tech companies due to what we see as overblown competitive and regulatory pressures. We also think investors are discounting or overlooking Google's moat in several areas.\nIn reality, Alphabet is not just another search engine, but a company that has a huge data advantage over its competitors and is able to provide a far superior service, as evidenced by the fact it did not lose material market share in the EU following a decision to let consumers decide which browser to use. The main downside that we think investors should consider at this time is on the macroeconomic front, where we think a recession is very near and could negatively impact Alphabet in the short to medium term. Finally, we would also pay attention to the widening gap between free cash flow and operating income in upcoming earnings reports.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of the 13 Most Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy According To Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other most undervalued blue chip stocks to buy according to analysts.\nThe Fed went through with a 50 basis point cut and as things have started to get clear, investors must give their portfolio another look. On September 20, Matt Stucky, Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management\u2019s chief equities portfolio manager, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss why and how investors must revisit their portfolios.\nHe suggested that now is the perfect time for investors to sit down and reassess their investments with the help of advisors. Stucky highlights that there is currently $6.3 trillion sitting in money market funds in the asset class, which may not be as attractive after the 50 basis point cut went through. He urged investors to consider a rather diversified portfolio and suggested that sitting on cash alone is risky.\nHe reiterated that while investors do not need to alter their long-term strategic goals, the ones with idle cash must try to allocate or deploy that money in other investment classes. According to Stucky, garnering a solid yield or return on investment does not come without risk and investors must understand that with the current Fed decision on board, it is impossible to get that kind of yield from cash alone.\nOn September 19, Dennis Lockhart, Former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, appeared in an interview on\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0to discuss the aftermath of the rate cut. According to Lockhart, the rate cut was perfectly balanced and rather optimistic in nature.\nHe believes that the Fed\u2019s decision was not reactionary to anything going on in the market or the economy. The Fed is particularly confident about the inflation rate, the labor market, and the soft landing of the economy.\nLockhart suggested that the Fed will reroute and remain flexible based on how the economy is performing from meeting to meeting. According to him, the Fed will aim to maintain flexibility and the 50 basis point cut was more like a compensation to what should have happened in July.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 13 most undervalued blue chip stocks to buy according to analysts we examined multiple similar rankings, our own rankings, and ETFs to come up with the best blue chip stocks. We then chose stocks with a forward P/E ratio that was less than the S&P 500\u2019s (22.68, as of September 22). Finally, we ranked the shortlisted stocks in ascending order of the analyst upside potential, as of September 22, 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nForward P/E, as of September 22: 21.4\nAnalyst Upside Potential, as of September 22: 25%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the most undervalued blue chip stocks to buy according to analysts. The company owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo.\nThe company is relentlessly working to improve the Gemini experience and is also actively involved in developing AI hardware, having launched its NVIDIA chip rival in May. Moreover, the latest version of Gemini has accelerated performance across text, audio, video, and code.\nWhile Google\u2019s tensor processing units (TPU) only account for almost 20% of the market, its advancements promise higher market shares. In addition to that, its six-generation chips are 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of processors.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) logged revenue worth $85 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, driven by the growing momentum in cloud and search. Additionally, over 60% of generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud. One can infer that the\u00a0technology giant is well-positioned to exploit the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment.\nAnalysts are bullish on GOOGL and their 12-month median price target of $205 points to a 25% upside from current levels. Overall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Of those,\u00a0Fisher Asset Management\u00a0was the highest stakeholder with a position of $8.86 billion.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 1st on our list of most undervalued blue chip stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Forever Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other forever stocks to buy now.\nInvestment opportunities are increasingly cropping up as volatility in the equity markets edge higher in response to changes in the investment environment. Investors have had to tweak their portfolios as global central banks tweak their monetary policies in response to slowing inflationary pressure.\nUncertainty over the upcoming US election is another headwind that is fuelling volatility in the markets. Geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, have also weighed significantly, forcing some investors to resort to defensive investment plays.\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy According To Warren Buffett and 10 Best Debt-Free Penny Stocks to Buy Now.\nNevertheless, the array of disappointing economic data led by weakness in the labor market has raised serious doubts about whether the US economy is overheating amid the high interest rates. With the economy creating partly 142,000 jobs and the unemployment rate at 4.25% in August, serious doubts were cast about the resilience of the US economy.\nInvestors need help understanding the state of the US economy, which had decelerated from the rapid expansion it experienced right after the pandemic when companies rushed to reopen and recruit new employees.\nReducing inflation has provided some relief for families struggling with rising costs. However, the job market has also slowed down, with fewer people being hired, wages increasing at a slower pace, and the duration of unemployment increasing as it becomes harder to secure employment.\nA survey carried out by CNBC indicates that the probability of the US economy experiencing a soft landing stands at 53% as the US Federal Reserve starts its interest rate cut cycle. According to Michael Englund of Action Economics, the US economy is growing much faster than expected, even as it stares at economic risks on the horizon.\nHowever, there is also a probability that the economy will plunge into recession at 36%, owing to the negative effects of the high interest rates. According to Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG US, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Power's legacy highly depends on him engineering a soft landing after keeping interest rates high for too long.\nSoucre: pexels\nAnalysts and economists share mixed opinions on whether the economy needs 25 or 50 basis points to start with to cure the effects of the high interest rate environment. The argument for beginning with a smaller cut is based on the assumption that the economy is fundamentally sound, as current and former FED officials argue.\nThey argue that starting with a 50-basis-point reduction could signal a deeper concern over the economy. It could prompt investors to expect quicker rate reductions, which could spark market booms that complicate efforts to combat inflation.\nOn the other hand, a bigger reduction might cause investors to believe wrongly that the Fed intends to lower rates by the same amount at its meetings in November and December. This could create an expectation that the Fed would move swiftly towards a neutral interest rate target, which is meant to neither stimulate nor decelerate economic growth, according to James Bullard, who served as the president of the St. Louis Fed from 2008 to 2023.\nAmid the monetary policy uncertainty and economic growth slowdown concerns, the US equity market has remained resilient and supported by solid financial results. The S&P 500 rallying by double percentage points affirms growing investor sentiment.\nThe artificial intelligence frenzy has been one of the main catalysts driving sentiments in the equity markets. Some stocks with exposure to AI have rallied by more than 50%. On the other hand, the FED cutting interest rates is expected to provide the much-needed fuel to sustain the upward momentum in the equity markets.\nThe best forever stocks to buy now are companies depicting solid revenue and earnings growth with low debt levels poised to generate long-term shareholder value. Additionally, they boast a competitive edge in their respective industries by investing billions of dollars in research and development. In addition, the companies are increasingly spearheading industrial trends and technological advancements such as artificial intelligence.\nOur Methodology\nThe best forever stocks offer stability and growth, making them ideal for long-term investors. We analyzed the iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF, focusing on high-quality US stocks with strong competitive advantages. We ranked the top 10 based on market cap and hedge fund holdings.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes as of Q2: 165\nMarket Cap as of September 18, 2024: $1.97 Trillion\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a tech giant that operates through Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. It provides products and services, including ads, Android, Chrome, Search, and YouTube.\nAlphabet is one of the best forever stocks to buy now as its cloud business is in a phase of robust growth, given that the cloud market is nascent. The enhancement of cloud solutions with AI is increasingly strengthening their competitive edge. Cloud revenues in the second quarter rose to $10.3 billion from $8 billion a year ago.\nThe company dominates the search world and has been integrating artificial intelligence features to enhance user experience. Likewise, the search business remains the company\u2019s core, generating billions of dollars in advertising revenues.\nDuring the second quarter, total revenues were up 14% to $84.74 billion as YouTube earned $8.7 billion from advertising alone, marking a 13% increase compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, Google Cloud experienced a significant rise in earnings, growing by 29% to surpass $10 billion in the same timeframe, illustrating the company\u2019s rapid expansion.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, which may provide a degree of financial stability. In the second quarter, it generated $23.6 billion in net income and $18.37 million as of last year\u2019s same quarter.\nBacked by a solid balance sheet with significant free cash flow, Alphabet has already started returning value to shareholders through dividend payments. The company has already confirmed a $0.20 dividend with a yield of 0.50%. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) looks incredibly cheap while trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 18.\nA total of 165 hedge funds were long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the second quarter.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe also added to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI. During the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.\u201d\nOverall GOOG\u00a0ranks 5th\u00a0on our list of the best undervalued cyclical stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Better AI Stock: Microsoft vs. Alphabet",
        "Author": "  Chris Neiger, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) race is still in its early stages, though it might not feel like it, and there's still plenty of time for tech companies to overtake each other. For investors looking for opportunities in the space, it may be appealing to pick a small AI start-up that might grow by leaps and bounds, but larger companies have deeper pockets, making their AI investments (and shifting strategies) much more likely to succeed.\nWhich ones will prove to be the best AI stocks in the coming years? Let's take a look at what Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are doing to shore up their AI dominance, and consider which one is more likely to be the better artificial intelligence stock in the coming years.\nLet's start with the most obviously smart AI move Microsoft has made: It invested an estimated $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. That gave Microsoft early access to some of the most advanced AI models available, and it wisely started embedding them into nearly all of its software products.\nChatGPT is the underlying AI tech in Microsoft's Copilot tools, which are now in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. The software bundle they comprise, Microsoft 365, is used by 1.3 million companies in the U.S. alone. For tens of millions of workers, Microsoft's software is now synonymous with the advanced AI tools they use every day.\nThis integration is already paying off for Microsoft, and the best example may come from the company's GitHub developer platform, in which 40% of its recent revenue growth came from Copilot, according to management. Microsoft's leadership said on the fourth-quarter earnings call that AI is driving GitHub's growth and has boosted its annual revenue run rate to $2 billion.\nOf course, Microsoft isn't just a software company these days. Its Azure unit is the second-largest cloud computing infrastructure provider in the world, with 25% of the market. Microsoft has integrated new AI tools into Azure, and management said on the Q2 earnings call that Azure now has 60,000 AI customers -- a 60% increase from the prior-year period.\nMicrosoft will probably make another noteworthy AI investment soon. OpenAI is about to have another funding round, and Microsoft is reportedly going to participate. Keeping OpenAI close is a wise bet right now. Microsoft is already benefiting from the companies' close working relationship, and there's no reason to believe it won't continue to reap the rewards in the near future.\nAlphabet has long been a major player in artificial intelligence, mostly with behind-the-scenes tech. For example, AI is a fundamental part of the systems that provide its Google Search results and YouTube recommendations, which feed relevant content to users and help power its ad business.\nBut on the generative AI front, Alphabet had to play catch-up over the past two years, releasing its own AI model called Gemini to compete with ChatGPT, and integrating more AI-powered responses into its search results.\nSo far, Gemini appears to be a success. On Alphabet's second-quarter earnings call, management said that all six of its Workspace products, which have more than 2 billion users, are now using Gemini. Gemini is sold as an add-on feature to the company's suite of products.\nBut one of the biggest AI opportunities for Alphabet may be in cloud computing. Google Cloud is the third-largest cloud infrastructure provider (behind Amazon Web Services and Azure), and its artificial intelligence integrations are already paying off. Google Cloud sales increased 29% in the second quarter to $10.3 billion, and part of that growth came from \"increasing contribution from AI,\" according to Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat.\nAnd, just like Microsoft, Alphabet has made investments in AI start-ups. Most notable was its $2 billion investment in OpenAI rival Anthropic, which makes the popular AI chatbot Claude. The investment should help Alphabet keep abreast of the newest AI capabilities coming from start-ups.\nWhile both of these companies could be good long-term AI plays, I think Microsoft has an edge over Alphabet for two reasons.\nFirst, Microsoft has a 49% ownership stake in OpenAI, which is arguably the leading generative AI software company right now. The decision to hitch its wagon to OpenAI's tech already looks like a smart one, and Microsoft could continue to benefit as OpenAI releases more advanced models and new services down the road.\nSecond, while Alphabet will benefit from selling AI services for Google Cloud, Microsoft is a larger cloud company and will probably see more benefit from AI-related demand. Goldman Sachs estimates cloud revenue from all tech companies could climb to $2 trillion by 2030, and much of the growth will be fueled by AI. With Microsoft already holding a quarter of the cloud market, it's well positioned to benefit.\nMicrosoft trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 32, which is more expensive than Alphabet's forward P/E of 17.6. \u200b\u200bWhile I'd usually prefer to pick the stock that's technically less expensive, I think Microsoft has enough of a jump on its rivals in the AI space that it could outperform them in the software and cloud computing arenas for years to come.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Alphabet: Uncovering Hidden Value Amid Market Declines",
        "Author": "  Wright's Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has recently seen its shares trade off from $193 to $158, representing a more than an 18% drop, as investors have arguably been discounting both competitive and regulatory pressures the company is currently facing.\nWe think this recent decline is largely exaggerated and that the stock is starting to get cheap again, both fundamentally and relative to industry peers. In addition, we also think investors may be discounting and overlooking the Google parent's moat relative to other big tech players, which are trading at significantly higher valuations. Finally, we look at the risks to our thesis and what investors should be aware of when looking at the stock.\nOne thing we think is often overlooked when analyzing Alphabet is the qualitative aspect of how much moat the company actually has. While it is easy to judge Apple's iPhone moat and ecosystem, Google has done a pretty good job of being a stronghold for consumers in multiple domains, with some services seen as very essential.\nIn fact, we believe consumers would find it difficult to see a world without Alphabet's ecosystem, which ranges from Gmail, Android, Google Cloud, Google Drive, Google Meet, YouTube, Google Maps and Google News, to name a few. In addition, after all these years, we think the company has created a very strong brand loyalty among its users, most of whom choose Google Chrome as their default web browser even when presented with another choice.\nEarlier this year, in March, new rules went into effect in the European Union, allowing users to choose which default browser to use, but this did not seem to have a substantial impact on Google's market share, which is another sign of its strong brand loyalty. We believe that even if Google is ordered to stop making payments to other companies, such as $20 billion to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for using Google Search as the default Web browser, it probably would not hurt Alphabet as much as it would hurt the other companies in question.\nIn general, just the data advantage Alphabet currently has over competitors, as well as the perceived accuracy advantage they seemingly have with Google Search, seems to be a dealbreaker for many users. Regardless, Google Search remains Alphabet's bread and butter, with the segment accounting for more than 57% of total revenue.\nAnother reason we think the company's moat is undervalued is the fact some of Google's business units, such as YouTube, could be worth more than publicly traded top-tier competitors. For example, YouTube ads alone pulled in $7.67 billion in ad revenue in the second quarter, compared with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which earned $9.56 billion in revenue last quarter. YouTube, on the other hand, has 2.7 billion active users versus Netflix, which has 277.65 million active subscribers.\nMoreover, we think YouTube is just at the beginning of monetizing its user base with YouTube Premium. In general, it would be quite conservative to give YouTube a rating similar to Netflix's, even though the number of minutes watched annually on YouTube is significantly higher than Netflix. Netflix, on the other hand, is currently trading with a market cap of $292 billion. And while many pointed out that YouTube's revenue this quarter fell short of expectations by $8.67 billion, or 13.02% year over year, revenue from Google Subscriptions, which includes the strong growth of YouTube Premium, rose 14.37% year over year to $9.31 billion.\nGoogle Cloud is also gaining momentum, with operating income up $395 million to $1.17 billion, while margins increased from 9.40% last quarter to 11.30% this quarter.\nOne of the most attractive features of Alphabet among big tech players, more specifically the Magnificent Seven, is the fact it is the cheapest of them all at certain valuations. On an enterprise value/Ebit basis, for example, the stock trades at only a ratio of 18.37, compared to other Magnificent Seven companies that typically trade at a multiple of at least 20 to 35 times.\nOverall, also looking at forward-looking estimates, Alphabet is trading at a mere 15.82 times 2026 forward price-earnings, against an expected $10.01 earnings per share. Moreover, the company has a massive $100.73 billion buffer of cash on its balance sheet. However, we noticed quite a difference between the figures in the income statement and free cash flow.\nFor example, if we look at operating income on a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow usually follows operating income pretty closely. In this case, we looked at free cash flow net of stock-based compensation. As you can see, as of the third quarter of 2023, adjusted free cash flow is significantly lower than normal compared to operating income. This difference is mainly due to higher investments due to spending on hardware for AI infrastructure, as well as changes in accounting from 2023, extending the life of their servers and hardware from four to five years to six years. With respect to the significant investments in AI infrastructure, it also remains to be seen whether this will translate into future flows of free cash flow.\nAnother key benefit for Alphabet investors is the fact it has used almost all of its free cash flow and sometimes some of its cash reserves to return capital to investors in the form of share repurchases. On a trailing 12-month basis, the company has repurchased $63.36 billion worth of shares while generating $60.79 billion in free cash flow. Outside of innovation in AI models, Alphabet is still going strong with initiatives such as Waymo, expanding its autonomous car fleet and recently partnering with Uber (NYSE:UBER) to integrate with existing Uber customers.\nHowever, there are risks to our bullish thesis as there are some macroeconomic and regulatory headwinds to keep in mind. First, in terms of legislative risks, Google is under scrutiny from several angles, both in the EU and in the United States, mainly regarding antitrust issues. In the United States, a judge recently ruled that Google Search is a monopoly, with the current lawsuit, with the plaintiff's request to have the company at least sell Google Ad Manager, ongoing, according to a report.\nIn the EU, the company just lost its appeal against a $2.42 billion fine over its comparison shopping service. Alphabet is also fighting two other fines around Google's practices with Android and the Google AdSense platform. The way we see these issues is that most of these rulings are likely to take several years to resolve, especially if it appeals. Moreover, by the time there is a ruling, Google may have enough competition from AI, for example with OpenAI's SearchGPT over ads. The company should also be able to easily pay these fines with the huge amounts of free cash flow it generates, as highlighted earlier.\nThe biggest problems we believe Alphabet may face in the short to medium term are at the macroeconomic level. First, the yield curve, more specifically the spread between the two-year and 10-year yields, is back in positive territory after being deeply inverted for about two years, which is a strong indicator that a recession is likely near. The Sahm Rule, which indicates the change in unemployment, also recently crossed the 0.50 threshold and currently stands at 0.57. At 0.57, a recession is usually imminent. Previous times when this value reached 0.57, there was always a recession.\nWhile many investors will view the recent announcement of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve positively, we want to remind people that interest rate cuts are reactive and not preventive. Usually, when interest rates are cut, unemployment has already risen dramatically and the United States is already in recession, with stock indexes down significantly. In addition, we would also be wary of insider trading in recent years with Alphabet, given that there have been almost no insider purchases and quite a few insider sales by management and directors.\nIn conclusion, we think Alphabet is getting cheap on both a fundamental, historical and relative basis, with the stock likely trading at a discount to other big tech companies due to what we see as overblown competitive and regulatory pressures. We also think investors are discounting or overlooking Google's moat in several areas.\nIn reality, Alphabet is not just another search engine, but a company that has a huge data advantage over its competitors and is able to provide a far superior service, as evidenced by the fact it did not lose material market share in the EU following a decision to let consumers decide which browser to use. The main downside that we think investors should consider at this time is on the macroeconomic front, where we think a recession is very near and could negatively impact Alphabet in the short to medium term. Finally, we would also pay attention to the widening gap between free cash flow and operating income in upcoming earnings reports.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Right Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks.\nThis year has been a healthy year for the American stock market, fueled by a strong performance from technology stocks. Several indices capped their best week of the year in early September as stocks rose ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting where the central bank was expected to cut interest rates. NASDAQ has led the charge and registered a 20% growth during the first half.\nWhile the index lists over 3,100 companies from various sectors, the rally has been led by its top seven holdings which account for 52% of the index. All of them being tech stocks. There is a mix of optimism and skepticism among investors on whether NASDAQ will be able to continue its good run over the second half of the year. Historical data over the past decade shows that in most instances, NASDAQ has finished stronger during the back half of the year. There have only been two years between 2014 and 2023 during which NASDAQ\u2019s year-end returns were lower than first-half returns.\nHowever, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, told CNBC earlier this month that investors need to be cautious, as stocks could fall 10% during the next eight weeks amid interest rate cuts and the nervousness around the upcoming presidential elections. The co-founder of the research firm also suggested that if the dip is too strong, it should be viewed as a buying opportunity for investors. Lee has largely been on the money and nailed most stock calls this year.\nOther analysts also anticipate market volatility ahead of the presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider noted that stock activity lags between June and August while traders are on vacation. This results in strong market performance aided by thinner trade volumes. The activity jumps up significantly in September when they return to their desks, which often leads to stock price volatility. According to her, a two percent shift in share price in either direction has become the norm in September. However, during election years, the volatility is at its peak in mid-October instead of September, and the market returns to normalcy after the results are announced.\nLPL Financial's Adam Turnquist also expects seasonal shakiness in the months ahead, but pointed out, like Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes.\nBuying the September or October lows has been a very good trade. October, things start to improve, and then you have this November, December, year-end rally, typically very high average returns and high positivity rates for those months.\nBoth Turnquist and Young Thomas agreed that existing portfolios should not be readjusted because of seasonal volatility because it is short-term and hard to forecast.\nWith that said, let\u2019s head over to see some of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy right now, given the current trends and future projections.\nWe scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 to look for stocks listed on NASDAQ and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an American technology giant headquartered in Mountain View, California. It owns a wide range of products and platforms, such as Google Search, Google Maps, Google Cloud, Gmail, Chrome, YouTube, and more. It is one of the world\u2019s largest tech companies by revenue.\nAccording to Insider Monkey's database, 165 hedge funds had stakes in the company as of Q2 2024, making it one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. During the second quarter of the year, the company reported EPS of $1.89, beating expectations of $1.85 per share. Consolidated revenues totaled $84.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Net income was recorded at $23.6 billion. These robust results were led by a strong performance from Google Search and Google Cloud.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s Cloud business crossed the $10 billion quarterly revenue mark for the first time and posted $1 billion in operating profit \u2013 which was also a first. Revenues within Google Services reached $73.9 billion, up from $66.2 billion during the same quarter in 2023. The 'Google Search & Other' segment revenue totaled $48.5 billion, while YouTube and Google Network generated $8.7 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, in revenues during the quarter. These results reflect the fast pace of growth in the company and have helped garner investor confidence. The London Company Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) \u2013 GOOG was a top performer this quarter as it reported strong Search revenue, tighter cost controls, and momentum in Cloud. Both direct and brand Search ads were better than expected and the strength in YouTube monetization continues. Expense controls have translated to 700bps of margin improvement. Management is removing layers to improve efficiency, which should drive margins higher. GOOG also provided details on paths to monetize Al for advertisers. GOOG initiated a dividend during the quarter to return additional cash to shareholders. It has a solid balance sheet, a significant market share, and generates strong returns.\nThe future outlook for the company looks solid, with consensus among analysts on the stock\u2019s Buy rating. It also has a share price target of $198, representing a 21% upside from its current level. There are also reports of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) negotiating a $23 billion acquisition of Wiz, a cybersecurity firm, that offers AI automation of tasks, threat detection, and vulnerability analysis. If the deal goes through, it will open the doors for the company in the cloud-native security arena by boosting its Mandiant cybersecurity platform.\nHowever, a recent defeat in an anti-trust lawsuit, where the Federal Court judge called Alphabet a \u2018monopoly\u2019 has come as a setback for the company. Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Alphabet stifled competition in the online search market to maintain its monopoly. This has led to some bearish sentiment around the stock, as it has hurt the company\u2019s reputation and can also result in billions of dollars in hefty fines or legal settlements.\nOverall GOOG ranks 6th our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.55%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.52%.\nComing into today, shares of the internet search leader had lost 3.38% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 1.56%, while the S&P 500 gained 3.67%.\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Alphabet in its upcoming release. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.83, reflecting a 18.06% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $72.77 billion, reflecting a 13.61% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.63 per share and revenue of $292.3 billion. These totals would mark changes of +31.55% and +13.95%, respectively, from last year.\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Also, the mean total yearly returns (including dividends) of the S&P 500 between 1996 to mid-June 2022 was ~9% in nominal terms, or ~6.8% in real terms.\nThe investors have seen significant fluctuations. S&P 500 saw a strong decline in 2000, 2001, and 2002, with a ~37% decline in 2008 and a ~22% fall in 1H 2022. That being said, between 1996 and mid-June 2022, S&P 500 returns only declined 5 times annually. While there can be significant fluctuations in the US markets, the macroeconomic indicators can help provide a broader overview of the expected performance of equities.\nThe decision on the rate cut by the US Federal Reserve was indeed a closely watched one. The apex bank decided to go for a larger 50-bps reduction in interest rates, instead of a more traditional 25-bps rate cut. This decision was more consequential than normal for 2 reasons. Firstly, this rate cut marked the initiation of a long-awaited easing cycle. Therefore, the US Federal Reserve shifted its focus away from\u00a0the risks related to inflation\u00a0and towards protecting the labor market and economic expansion.\nSecondly, the rate cut decision itself was much more critical and engaging than normal. History suggests that the US Fed provides greater transparency when it comes to decision-making. This means the financial markets are not surprised by the decision as people know what the US Fed is going to do. However, the recent one was not like this, with markets pricing the 25-bps rate cut decision. The move to cut the key rates by 50 basis points should help the US Fed normalize rates more quickly and be ahead of the emergent\u00a0slowness in the broader labor market. That being said, the US Fed's forecasts (the\u00a0dots) don't reflect this pace continuing beyond September.\nThe recent report by Russell Investments highlighted that the company expects the US Fed to cut rates by 25 basis points at each of the remaining meetings in 2024. Furthermore, this pace should be sustained into 2025. If the trajectory continues, the US Fed will be down to the company\u2019s expectations of the normal or equilibrium rate of interest of between 3%-3.25% by this time of the next year.\nThe implications for the rate cut onto equities hang mainly on the fundamental backdrop\u2014i.e., corporate earnings and whether the US economy is heading for a soft or hard landing. In case of a soft landing, Russell Investments believes that the combination of lower rates and resilient fundamentals should benefit select areas of the market such as real estate and small caps. Regarding\u00a0small caps, in particular, the investment firm expects a ripe environment for skilled active managers to pick quality businesses at more attractive valuations.\nIn the remainder of 2024 and 2025, the US Fed cuts are expected to have a positive effect on the economy and markets. Analysts at Wells Fargo believe that the global economy should also benefit, as major central banks around the world have already announced the cut rates or will be announcing soon.\nMarket experts believe that the Fed rate cut expectations have led to the investors rejigging their portfolios and pivoting towards public companies that are interest-rate sensitive. These include dividend companies, telecommunication giants, utilities, and REITs, among others.\nWall Street also believes that the rate cuts should help well-established and financially stable companies to increase their spending and investments, which are likely to reflect in their stock prices in the remainder of 2024 and early 2025.\nOur methodology\nTo list the 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we conducted an extensive online search and sifted through online rankings and VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF.

The company offers web-based searches, advertisements, maps, software applications, and other related services.\nAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0continues to enjoy wide economic moat as a result of significant intangible assets associated with the overall technological expertise in search algorithms and AI (ML and deep learning), together with access to and accumulation of valuable data for advertisers.\u00a0As a result of these competitive advantages, the company\u2019s network effect has been becoming stronger. With an increasing number of online users and usage, digital ad spending is bound to increase, and Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0will be the primary beneficiary. In 2Q 2024, the company\u2019s advertising revenue, which is a significant part of its business, came in at $64.62 billion as compared to an estimate of $64.53 billion.\nAlso, Android\u2019s huge global market share of smartphones places the company well to continue dominating the mobile search.

The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 1st on our list of the best wide moat stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has fallen significantly from its previous peak in recent months as concerns about new competition in search, overspending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, and the broader health of the economy have pressured the stock lower.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other fast money stocks.\nAs the financial world grapples with shifting economic indicators and political uncertainty, insights from leading experts offer a crucial perspective on what lies ahead. With inflation showing signs of easing and the Federal Reserve signaling a likely rate cut, the focus now shifts to earnings performance and broader economic trends. Adding to this complexity are political developments, such as the possibility of a Republican sweep.\nThe latest June 2024 inflation report revealed a softer-than-expected outcome, causing varied reactions across major stock indices. Initially, futures surged in response, but have since fluctuated. Currently, the Dow is showing gains, the S&P is up slightly, and the NASDAQ is just below the flatline. Inflation dropped by a tenth of a percent month-over-month, contrary to economists' forecasts of a rise.\nChris Harvey, Head of Equity Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, and Mike Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JPMorgan, shared their perspectives on the current financial situation in an episode of CNBC's Fast Money. Chris Harvey is cautious about the concept of market rotation due to ongoing uncertainties about earnings. While he doesn't oppose rotation, he pointed out that investor confidence is still shaky.\n\"That\u2019s right. We\u2019re not against rotation; we\u2019re just waiting for more clarity. Many investors are uncertain about earnings. Until we see a situation where companies don\u2019t go down on bad news, we won\u2019t be fully convinced about the rotation. We want people to believe that numbers will improve and that things will get better. However, right now, bad news is bad news, and that suggests the rotation may not be sustainable.\"\nIn contrast, Mike Feroli discussed the anticipated rate cuts. He believes that the Fed is likely to lower rates soon due to its more aggressive stance. Feroli suggests that the economy is weaker than some might think, which supports the expectation of rate cuts. He noted that we have probably reached the peak for interest rates and that future attention will shift to earnings performance.\nFeroli also explained why he updated his forecast to September. This change is based on recent CPI data showing significant inflation drops over the past year and a rise in unemployment. He expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, with additional cuts likely on a quarterly basis.\n\"Yes, the rate cuts are coming. The Fed has signaled their intention to cut rates more aggressively than they have in the past. We also believe the economy isn\u2019t as strong as some might think, so we expect rates to come down. I think we\u2019ve already hit the peak for rates. Right now, it\u2019s really about earnings.\"\nHowever, if the labor market weakens further, the pace of these cuts could accelerate. Regarding the potential impact of a Donald Trump presidency and a possible Republican sweep, Feroli highlighted the uncertainties. A Republican sweep could lead to more tax cuts, possibly extending or expanding those from 2017, which might boost growth but also increase deficits.\nAdditionally, trade and immigration policies remain unpredictable. While deregulation might mitigate some negative effects, the overall policy environment is still uncertain. Finally, when asked about the implications of a Republican sweep for bond markets, Feroli expressed concern about the deficit trajectory. Extending all tax cuts, particularly in a more Republican-leaning scenario, could exacerbate the deficit problem.\nIn another episode of Fast Money, Chris Mman, Chief Investment Officer at Lafayette College, discussed the potential timing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, emphasizing that September appears to be a strong possibility. He notes, however, that the Fed will be influenced by upcoming economic reports. Mman also highlights concerns over equity valuations and the potential impact of delayed rate cuts on the labor market.\n\"I believe July should have been on the table based on today\u2019s report. However, the Fed usually prefers to signal their plans in advance. My expectation was that they probably wouldn't preemptively set up for September, but given today\u2019s report, it seems quite likely they will. The Fed might use upcoming meetings and communications to guide the market's expectations.\"\nAs political uncertainties, including the Democratic ticket's spotlight, add to the mix, Mman reassures that the Fed is likely to focus on economic data rather than political pressures. He stresses that while inflation remains a critical issue, the Fed's priority will be managing employment trends to avoid a deeper economic downturn.\n\"Even if inflation accelerates temporarily, it\u2019s unlikely to concern the Fed greatly. Currently, the focus has shifted more to employment reports rather than inflation. If employment were to unexpectedly strengthen, it could reduce the Fed\u2019s incentive to cut rates. Ultimately, the goal is to avoid a severe economic slowdown that would force them into aggressive rate cuts.\"\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we review recent episodes of CNBC's Fast Money, where Fast Money traders highlighted stocks with high growth potential. We tracked each stock mentioned and ranked them based on frequency. From this, we identified the top 7 stocks that were mentioned a lot by Fast Money traders and were widely held by hedge funds.

Key discussions revolved around energy-efficient computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and advanced semiconductor technologies, signaling critical transformations in tech and telecommunications. At the conference, companies working in the tech universe outlined their strategic outlooks, emphasizing the role of energy-efficient computing in driving semiconductor growth, with industries like AI, IoT, robotics, and autonomous vehicles fueling multi-trillion-dollar shifts.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOne of the highlights of the conference was the appearance of NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, who appeared alongside Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon to discuss the AI industry in great detail. Quizzed about the recent US export controls on chips to China and the rise in geopolitical tensions potentially harming supplies, Huang outlined that his company was confident that if Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the Taiwan-based leading supplier of advanced AI chips to NVIDIA, was compromised, the chip supply would continue, even though it would not be as good. Huang stressed that NVIDIA possessed enough intellectual property to transfer chip production from one plant to another, if need be.\nNVIDIA has lost more than 15% of market capitalization since it issued third quarter guidance numbers that raised worries about slowing earnings growth. In particular, there were concerns about the concentration of hyperscalers in the NVIDIA business model, with four large customers representing nearly half of the revenue of the firm in relation to the AI boom.

Thomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, spoke at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia and Technology Conference earlier this month, noting how his company had been way ahead of the others in building AI infrastructure over the past decade. Kurian underlined that these investments were now starting to bear fruit. For example, he revealed that 90% of AI unicorns run on cloud services offered by Google for training and inference. 60% of all AI funded start-ups ever use AI infrastructure developed by Google for training or inference.\nKurian, who was at software firm Oracle before joining Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), added that traditional companies were also now building both high-performance and generative AI models on the Google Cloud. Kurian gave the example of carmaker Ford Motor Company, detailing that Ford was using the deep learning technology of Google to build simulations for wind tunnel and for virtual wind tunnel simulation, replacing a traditional approach called computational fluid dynamics.\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th among the buzzing AI stocks to buy according to Goldman Sachs.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fortune 500 Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other Fortune 500 stocks.\nThe aggregate revenue of the Fortune 500 companies in 2023 reached a record $41 trillion, up 0.1% year-over-year. Profits also rose 2% after declining earlier in 2022. The US took the lead from Greater China with the most companies on the Fortune 500 list for the first time since 2018. It has 139 companies as of August this year, an increase of 3 from 2023, while Greater China has 133 companies, down 9 from last year.\nThe financial sector, including banks and insurance companies, led all industries with the most Fortune 500 companies. Collectively tech giants brought in $282 billion in net income, up from $233 billion the previous year. Currently, 13 companies are making their Fortune 500 debut, reflecting the world's fascination with AI and weight-loss drugs.\nWhile the S&P 500 has recovered most of its losses, the rebound is being led by sectors like real estate, utilities, and consumer staples rather than major tech companies. Investors are shifting focus due to concerns over economic growth and expectations of Fed rate cuts.\nStill, it seems like investors think that while investment portfolios should be diversified given the current economic conditions, this sentiment does not imply divesting from tech stocks, which of course contribute greatly to the aggregate Fortune 500 revenue. Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management head of Americas Asset Allocation, emphasized this sentiment and we covered this earlier in our article about the 10 Best Tech Stocks To Buy Right Now Under $10:\n\u201c...investors should view potential dips in tech stocks as good long-term buying opportunities, as 10% corrections are historically good entry points in tech... He thinks that this market volatility is acyclical. The recent sell-off in the tech sector was not primarily due to economic concerns but rather to sector-specific issues. Despite this, tech giants will continue to benefit from the AI CapEx investment story. While there may be short-term challenges, the long-term outlook for these companies remains positive... Draho also cautioned against over-concentrating portfolios in the sector. He suggested diversifying exposure by investing in sector leaders as well as companies likely to benefit from tech disruption as a way to manage potential downside risks in tech stocks.\u201d\nJust last week, Dan Greenhaus, Solus Alternative Asset Management's chief strategist discussed markets, and the rebound's staying power, all while suggesting that predicting the Fed's next move had become more difficult.\nHe discussed the ongoing recession concerns, particularly after negative comments from financial representatives. Despite these worries, he believes the US consumer is performing well, the economy is stable, and corporate profits are exceeding expectations. This context suggests that the recent sell-off in certain AI stocks was followed by a justified rebound, as issues appear limited to recent trends.\nThe S&P 500 is currently facing resistance around the 5,600 level, a key point of concern for investors. Dan Greenhaus noted that the recent inversion of the yield curve raised anxiety but the 2-10-year curve is slightly positive. Despite these worries, credit spreads for investment-grade bonds remain stable, and overall cross-asset indicators suggest a stable market environment.\nRecently, discussions around potential interest rate changes have gained momentum, particularly following insights from Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. He indicated a likely 25 basis point cut by the Federal Reserve, although he also acknowledged the possibility of a 50 basis point reduction. Greenhaus believes the Fed will opt for a 25 basis point cut, marking the start of a series of reductions. This perspective is supported by the normalization of inflation and a slowing economy.\nAccording to Greenhaus, the cyclical components of the stock market appear to be performing well, indicating that the overall economic fundamentals remain robust, and there is no concrete case for any specific rate cut scenario. As Fortune 500 companies continue to generate record revenues and profits as well, investor sentiments should not be shifting drastically. With that being said, we're here with a list of 10 best Fortune 500 stocks to buy now.\nMethodology\nWe first looked at the list of Fortune 500 companies, as of 2024. We then selected 10 stocks from these Fortune 500 companies that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nMarket Capitalization as of September 14: $1941.84 billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, is one of the world's largest technology companies. It encompasses a wide range of businesses, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo, and is known for its innovative products and services, and its focus on AI and other cutting-edge technologies.\nThe company also has a direct presence in the autonomous driving industry through its Waymo business division. More than 700 Waymo cars are present in San Francisco alone, and they have also come under criticism for fires, crashes, and traffic violations. It also offers robotaxi services, and Waymo shared in August that it offers 100,000 robotaxi rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, Arizona.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is projected to achieve a $100 billion revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In Q2, Cloud revenue alone increased by 28.8%. Overall revenue grew by 13.59%, totaling $84.74 billion. Google currently holds approximately 91.06% of the search engine market.\nGoogle plans to spend $50 billion on AI initiatives by the end of 2024. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) leverages strong competitive advantages through its algorithms, AI expertise, and valuable data access. Its capabilities suggest a positive outlook for the future. 216 hedge funds are long GOOGL, with the highest stake at $8,856,226,893 by Fisher Asset Management.\nPatient Capital Management\u00a0stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best Fortune 500 stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) stock has recovered quite nicely from the deep selloff it endured near the end of 2022, as its advertising channels continue to consistently deliver big numbers. While Alphabet still heavily depends on ad sales, the company\u2019s new growth engine is Google Cloud. I\u2019m bullish on both parts of the business, but Google Cloud offers more upside potential as the tech giant continues to gain ground on its peers.\nAd revenue carries the bulk of the revenue load at Google, having generated $64.6 billion for the\u00a0second quarter of 2024. That\u2019s an increase of 11.1% year-over-year. Google Search and YouTube ads revenue jumped by 13.8% and 13.0% year-over-year, respectively.\u00a0A bullish investor can take comfort in these numbers.\nGrowth in this segment is\u00a0good\u00a0for Alphabet\u2019s profit margins, as the advertising segment is known for having high margins. Alphabet wrapped up the second quarter with a 27.9% net profit margin. Those margins will likely increase as the company delivers operational efficiencies including from cost cutting. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see the company record a 30% net profit margin in at least one quarter in 2025 as profitability grows.\nAlphabet put itself in the spotlight when it announced its first dividend earlier this year. The yield is roughly 0.50%, and Alphabet will likely strive to make a further impression with a double-digit dividend hike in 2025.\nThe results of Alphabet\u2019s advertising division alone could make GOOGL stock attractive, but Google Cloud offers another reason to be bullish. This part of Alphabet\u2019s business is growing much faster than its advertising segment, and it\u2019s no longer a small offshoot like in previous years. Google Cloud revenue reached $10.4 billion in Q2, representing more than 12% of total revenue for the quarter.\nGoogle Cloud\u2019s impact on future earnings reports will grow, and that\u2019s good news for investors. Cloud revenue jumped by 28.8% year-over-year. That growth rate has been normal for Google Cloud, and its profitability is also improving. Google Cloud\u2019s operating income almost tripled year-over-year, going from $395 million to $1.17 billion. Cloud profit margins have the potential to soar quickly, and the accelerated growth from this part of Alphabet\u2019s business suggests higher profit margins are awaiting patient investors.\nAlphabet has a dominant position in artificial intelligence, a\u00a0critical technology that can accelerate advertising and cloud revenue. The tech giant\u2019s AI capabilities make me bullish. Alphabet is using AI to run better ads that maximize results for its customers. This will incentivize more ad spend as companies continue to invest in the marketing channels that drive the most results. Artificial intelligence has also strengthened Google Cloud\u2019s core offering. Additionally, the intense bandwidth necessary for AI has also prompted more businesses to use Google Cloud.\nArtificial intelligence is still in its early innings. The industry is projected to achieve\u00a0annualized growth of 19.3% from now until 2034, according to Precedence Research. Alphabet is one of the leaders in software for companies looking to capitalize on artificial intelligence, and that should drive accelerating revenue growth from Google Cloud. The tech giant\u2019s AI capabilities make me bullish, as they have sparked accelerated growth across its underlying companies.\nAlphabet, Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), three of the largest companies in town, are all heavily focused on cloud computing. Together, these companies have helped pace the stock market in recent years.\nIn terms of relative valuation, Alphabet trades at a 23.4 P/E ratio, which is a lower valuation than for MSFT stock or AMZN stock. Microsoft carries a 36.5x P/E ratio, while Amazon\u2019s multiple stands at 46.4x. Google\u2019s relative valuation appeal makes it easier to be bullish on the stock. Alphabet has higher profit margins than Amazon and a higher net income growth rate than Microsoft.\nGoogle Cloud\u00a0also\u00a0grew faster than Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Cloud in the second quarter. While Google Cloud revenue increased by 28.8% year-over-year, Amazon Web Services only registered 19% year-over-year revenue growth. Microsoft Cloud fared slightly better with 21% year-over-year revenue growth, but both of those growth rates trail what Alphabet delivered. If Alphabet continues to gain market share in cloud computing, I predict the stock will perform well.\nWall Street analysts currently hold a consensus Strong Buy rating on shares of GOOGL. From the 37 analysts covering the Alphabet stock, 28 offer Buy ratings while 9 have Hold ratings. No Wall Street analysts rate GOOGL stock a Sell. The average price target for GOOGL is $201.44, implying nearly 25% potential upside.\nAlphabet has been a leading stock in recent years and has outperformed the S&P 500. While advertising revenue has historically been the driver of GOOGL, Google Cloud is the next captivating growth opportunity. Alphabet\u2019s cloud platform growth is outpacing ad revenue growth and gaining ground on AWS and Microsoft Cloud. I\u2019m bullish on GOOGL stock, especially with an undemanding 23.4 P/E ratio.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Big Tech Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other big tech stocks.\nBig tech has long been an immensely popular area to invest in when it comes to US stocks, and for good reason. Tech stocks, particularly those investing in AI and offering AI products, have been generating immense returns in 2024, with the second week of September bearing witness to their immense potential. This week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their best returns for the entire year, and many tech stocks were part of the faction that made this possible. As a result, there's a huge rise in the popularity of AI and tech stocks. This is in stark contrast to market opinions on AI stocks, particularly during the first week of September, when many were very concerned that we are in an AI hypecycle that is bound to wind down soon.\nAltimeter Capital's CEO, Brad Gerstner, recently joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss trends shaping big tech right now. He noted that the pace of\u00a0 AI at present is faster than any other tech development seen before. He also added that many investors are starting to lean back into big tech ahead of the election. This development may be coming about because of the historical trend that suggests that stocks perform better in the months directly following a US election - in which case, it makes sense for investors to be piling into big tech and AI right now since that's a sure shot way to profit in the next few months.\nA recent notable trend that people have begun to see because of the rise of big tech companies and the growing use of AI is a greater demand for power. Many major tech companies are beginning to require more energy, with the AWS-owner going as far as buying a nuclear-powered data center for $650 million recently.\nThe primary driving force for this rising demand is the need to develop AI. Many energy-conscious investors may see this new trend as a red flag for big tech. However, Jensen Huang has noted that while AI takes a ton of energy to train, once developed and trained, it will also help save energy. He particularly noted that AI is going to become so advanced through this development that it will eventually end up offering solutions that can change the way we use energy, making our operations endlessly more energy efficient.\nWith this in mind, big tech seems to be quite an interesting space to follow right now, especially in the days leading up to the US Presidential Elections. As such, we've compiled a list of the best big tech stocks to buy right now.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nFor our list below, we selected big-tech stocks with the highest numbers of hedge funds holding stakes in them during the second quarter and then ranked them based on this metric in ascending order.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another reputable big tech player on the market, more familiarly known as Google. It is based in Mountain View, California.\nGoogle Search and Google Cloud are some of the top-performing segments operated by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), with the former representing about 57% of the company's revenue in the second quarter and the latter garnering analyst attention recently for becoming more profitable. However, many investors are more interested in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) because it owns YouTube, a highly successful video platform.\nIn the second quarter, YouTube generated $8.7 billion in ad revenue alone, up 13% year-over-year. Google Cloud has also seen revenues soar by 29% to over $10 billion in the second quarter - showing the business' fast pace of growth. In light of all this, the biggest challenge Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) seems to be facing is the recent antitrust case it lost against the US government, where the company was called a monopoly.\nMany are concerned that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will be broken up as a result of this ruling. But realistically speaking, this doesn't seem all that easy to accomplish when you're dealing with a tech giant. Regardless of what happens in the aftermath, the individual successes of all of Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) business segments are enough to assure investors of the company's success and further growth in the future.\nWe saw 216 hedge funds long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $35.3 billion.\nBaron Funds mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe also added to\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI. During the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best big tech stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe that AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Some of the most trending ones relate to electronics giant Apple, Microsoft-backed AI startup OpenAI, and software firm Adobe. Apple has doubled down on AI with the release of macOS Sequoia, which integrates AI features designed to enhance device performance and user experience.

This model is expected to advance the capabilities of OpenAI in both consumer-facing tools and enterprise applications. Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos. This positions Adobe at the forefront of generative AI for content creation, with a focus on commercial safety by using licensed datasets.\nLooking ahead, Wall Street analysts project significant revenue and earnings growth for key players in the AI space, particularly in semiconductor companies that power AI applications. NVIDIA, for example, is forecast to achieve an impressive 27% annual revenue growth, outperforming both the semiconductor industry and the broader US market. The total revenue for the chipmaker in 2025 is expected to reach around $123 billion, with earnings projected to grow by over 24%\u200b.

The Irish government has previously conducted such inquiries against social media platform X as well.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has received bullish calls from Wall Street. Stifel analyst Mark Kelley raised the price target on the stock to $199 from $196 and kept a Buy rating, detailing that the company reported revenue and operating income ahead of expectations with continued strength in Search and a slight beat in Google Cloud, though YouTube growth slowed relative to Q1.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Buy According To George Soros. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks among the 10 best growth stocks to buy according to George Soros.\nGeorge Soros, the owner of Soros Fund Management, is known as one of the most controversial investors in the history of investing. The now 94-year-old, \u201cbroke the Bank of England\u201d after he reportedly made $1 billion from shorting the British pound in 1992. As of September 19, Soros has a net worth of $7.2 billion. He managed client money in New York from 1969 to 2011.\nSoros Fund Management was founded in 1970 and manages almost $28 billion in net assets at the moment. The fund is the principal asset manager for Soros\u2019 philanthropic venture, the Open Society Foundations (OSF). So far he has given away more than $32 billion of his fortune to the OSF. Last year, Soros handed over the fund to his eldest son, Alexander Soros, who now aims to take his philanthropic endeavors to another level.\nSoros is known for being ahead of the market. Historically, he has made financial decisions after gauging market feedback and predicting market activities, that have returned or saved him millions, if not billions. This is what he calls the \u201creflexivity\u201d theory. By applying this theory to finance and investments, Soros values assets based on market feedback, predicts market bubbles, and exploits market opportunities. A recent example of this was when Soros pulled out a staggering $73 million from two major technology players right before the tech downturn in mid-July.\nSoros also uses another method, which he calls the Soros\u2019 Method, to forecast events in the financial markets using current data. He then tests his theories on small investments and if the theory seems to be working out, he expands his position or size of his investment. This, however, does not mean that Soros has never failed or encountered risk during his time as an investor. He has made multiple expensive decisions from which he learned lessons and has even quoted them in his books. Here is an excerpt of what he said in his book, Soros on Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve:\n\u201cThe prevailing wisdom is that markets are always right. I take the opposition position. I assume that markets are always wrong. Even if my assumption is occasionally wrong, I use it as a working hypothesis. It does not follow that one should always go against the prevailing trend. On the contrary, most of the time the trend prevails; only occasionally are the errors corrected. It is only on those occasions that one should go against the trend. This line of reasoning leads me to look for the flaw in every investment thesis. \u2026 I am ahead of the curve. I watch out for telltale signs that a trend may be exhausted. Then I disengage from the herd and look for a different investment thesis. Or, if I think the trend has been carried to excess, I may probe going against it. Most of the time we are punished if we go against the trend. Only at an inflection point are we rewarded.\u201d\nOne can say that Soros\u2019 degree in philosophy helped him carve his way into the financial markets. Now that we have studied Soros\u2019 investment philosophy, let\u2019s take a look at the 10 best growth stocks according to George Soros.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best growth stocks according to George Soros, we examined his 13F portfolio and selected his top 10 growth stock picks, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nSoros Fund Management Stake Value: $166.02 Million\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the best growth stocks to buy according to Soros. The company owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Wyamo. The technology giant is well-positioned to exploit the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment.\nGoogle DeepMind, the company\u2019s research lab is relentlessly working to improve the Gemini experience and is also actively involved in developing AI hardware, and launched its NVIDIA chip rival in May. Moreover, the latest version of Gemini has accelerated performance across text, audio, video, and code.\nWhile Google\u2019s tensor processing units (TPU) only account for almost 20% of the market, its advancements promise higher market shares. Moreover, its six-generation chips are 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of processors. The new chip will be made available to Google Cloud users by the end of 2024.\nOverall, the company\u2019s new AI models and algorithms are 100 times more efficient compared to 18 months ago. Additionally, over 60% of generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud.\u00a0Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) expects to log $100 billion in revenue run rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In addition to that, in the second quarter, cloud revenue increased by 28.8% and overall revenue increased by 13.59%.\nAnalysts are bullish on GOOGL and their 12-month median price target of $205 points to a 26% upside from current levels.

The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the best growth stocks to buy according to George Soros.

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): A Bear Case Theory",
        "Author": "  Ricardo Pillai ",
        "Text": "We came across a\u00a0bearish thesis\u00a0on Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) on Kroker Equity Research\u2019s Substack by Kroker Equity Research. In this article we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on GOOGL. Alphabet Inc. share was trading at $154.69 as of Sept 12th.\nPixabay/Public Domain\nAlphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, is a global leader in digital products and platforms. The company operates through three main segments: Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. Google Services includes products such as Search, YouTube, Android, and Gmail, which are integral to Alphabet's dominance in the digital world. Google Cloud has also made significant strides, transitioning from an operating loss in 2021 and 2022 to profitability in 2023, largely driven by revenue growth and reduced depreciation expenses from changes in the estimated useful life of servers and network equipment. With this turnaround, the Cloud segment is now expected to contribute significantly to Alphabet\u2019s financial performance in the future, as outlined by management in the Q1 2024 earnings call.\nFinancially, Alphabet is exceptionally profitable and debt-free, generating substantial free cash flow while continuing to invest heavily in infrastructure, particularly for AI applications. Despite the large capital expenditures, Alphabet's profitability has improved, with its return on invested capital (ROIC) reaching 29% in Q1 2024. The company has also been actively repurchasing shares, with significant buybacks authorized and executed in recent years, although a substantial portion of these repurchases offsets dilution from stock-based compensation.\nAlphabet's growth potential is also supported by YouTube, a standout platform that captures nearly 10% of U.S. screen time. YouTube has expanded significantly, with ad revenues reaching $31.5 billion in 2023 and a growing base of over 100 million Music and Premium subscribers. This growth underscores YouTube's critical role in Alphabet\u2019s strategy and its future profitability prospects.\nAlphabet's heavy investment in AI is another key aspect of its growth strategy. The company is integrating AI capabilities across its products and services, although it currently lags behind competitors like OpenAI and Microsoft. Nonetheless, Alphabet is confident in the long-term opportunities that AI presents. The company's plans to acquire Wiz, a cybersecurity startup, for $23 billion further indicate its commitment to strengthening its cloud business, enhancing its competitive position against larger rivals like AWS and Microsoft Azure.\nWhile Alphabet's financial performance and market leadership suggest a compelling investment case, its valuation remains a point of concern. A discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis suggests the stock may be overvalued at its current price of $177 per share, even under optimistic scenarios. Although Alphabet is an exceptional business with strong growth prospects, potential investors must consider the risk of overpaying, even for a company of this caliber.\nAlphabet Inc. is on our list of the\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 216 hedge fund portfolios held GOOGL at the end of the second quarter which was 222 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Will Weakness in Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock Prove Temporary Given Strong Fundamentals?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had a rough three months with its share price down 12%. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Alphabet's  ROE.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n View our latest analysis for Alphabet \nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:\n29% = US$88b \u00f7 US$301b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.29 in profit.\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nFirst thing first, we like that Alphabet has an impressive ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 7.1% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for Alphabet's moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.\nAs a next step, we compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 11%.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is GOOGL worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether GOOGL is currently mispriced by the market.\nAlphabet has a low three-year median payout ratio of 2.8%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 97% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.\nLooking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 9.7% over the next three years. Regardless, the ROE is not expected to change much for the company despite the higher expected payout ratio.\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Alphabet's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

        "Text": "Taking full advantage of the stock market and investing with confidence are common goals for new and old investors alike.\nMany investors also have a go-to methodology that helps guide their buy and sell decisions. One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum.\nMomentum investors, who live by the saying \"the trend is your friend,\" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.\nAlphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly with more than 94% of the online search volume and market. Over the years, the company has witnessed increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.\nGOOGL sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), holds a Momentum Style Score of B, and has a VGM Score of B. The stock is up 0.4% and up 0.6% over the past one-week and four-week period, respectively, and Alphabet has gained 23% in the last one-year period as well. Additionally, an average of 25,661,262 shares were traded over the last 20 trading sessions.\nMomentum investors don't just pay attention to price changes; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. One analyst revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.01 to $7.63 per share. GOOGL boasts an average earnings surprise of 9.6%.\nWith strong earnings growth, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Momentum and VGM Style Scores, investors should think about adding GOOGL to their portfolios.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the ChatGPT Stock Advice: 10 Recent Stock Recommendations.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other stocks recommended by ChatGPT.\nChatGPT has quickly become an essential tool for both professional and personal use, thanks to its human-like responses. Analysts are also exploring its potential for stock picking, using criteria like low P/E ratios to find undervalued stocks. While some question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, a study from the University of Florida suggests that ChatGPT can predict stock price movements more accurately than some basic analysis models.\nOpenAI recently made a major leap by launching GPT-4o, a new AI model, alongside a desktop version of ChatGPT and an updated user interface. This update brings GPT-4 to all users, including those on the free tier, with enhanced speed and capabilities in text, video, and audio. The \"o\" in GPT-4o stands for \"omni,\" indicating its ability to support 50 languages and be available via APIs, allowing developers to start building applications with the new model right away.\nThe S&P 500 and NASDAQ are on track for their tenth consecutive positive session, driven by the same bullish factors that have propelled the market throughout the year. Inflation continues to trend downward, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. This potential for rate cuts supports the market by fostering conditions that could lead to a soft economic landing.\nEd Clissold, Ned Davis Research chief U.S. strategist, told CNBC that quarterly earnings growth has consistently accelerated over the past few quarters, with Q2 showing strong results and Q3 expected to follow suit. This steady growth suggests no significant changes in the underlying market thesis, keeping investor sentiment positive.\nDespite the recent volatility seen in August, which was partly driven by a spike in market uncertainty and liquidity issues, analysts do not expect this to carry over into September. The possibility of rate cuts by the Fed is providing a solid foundation for the market, though there are some concerns about elevated earnings estimates for Q3 and the upcoming election.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is close to an all-time high, with stocks like Travelers, Boeing, and 3M leading the charge. Analysts predict a broad market advance, with potential for catch-up in sectors that have lagged behind this year. As interest rates are likely to come down, the market rally could broaden beyond just AI and mega-cap growth stocks.\nLooking ahead to next week, key economic data will be in focus, including PCE data on Friday and consumer spending insights on Tuesday. Investors are hoping for \"Goldilocks\" economic data\u2014not too hot, not too cold\u2014that would confirm the Fed's rate cut path without signaling an economic downturn. The market favors moderate economic growth, which would support continued stock market gains.\nIn a world overwhelmed by information, ChatGPT offers a solution for investors. Its natural language processing capabilities allow it to sift through vast amounts of data and provide concise, actionable summaries, helping investors make informed decisions. By reducing information costs and democratizing financial knowledge, ChatGPT is becoming an invaluable tool for individual investors.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article we prompted ChatGPT multiple times to recommend stocks, based on the data as of its knowledge cutoff date. ChatGPT recommended 10 stocks based on \u00a0\u201chistorical trends\u201d and the \u201cmarket landscape\u201d from various sectors which have \u201csubstantial\u201d potential over the next few years. We shortlisted the stocks that were recommended the most and then further selected the ones that were the most widely held by hedge funds. We have sorted these stocks based on the number of hedge fund investors as of Q2 2024.\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nIn a recent legal development, a judge ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by abusing its monopoly in the market, particularly through an exclusive deal with Apple. However, some argue that this ruling is outdated and fails to consider the rapidly evolving landscape of AI in search technology.\nThe possibility of a Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) breakup has sparked discussions about its impact on the company's stock and overall structure. Gene Munster, a tech analyst, believes that if an announcement were made about breaking up Google, the stock could potentially rise by 5% or more, unlocking up to 20% of its value. However, he also estimates the likelihood of such a breakup at around 15%.\nDan Ives, Managing Director of Equity Research at Wedbush Securities suggests that the current antitrust challenges will likely result in business model adjustments rather than full-scale breakups. While these issues are more than just minor inconveniences, they are not expected to significantly disrupt the core operations or profitability of these tech giants. Interestingly, Ives notes that if companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google were to be broken up, the sum of their individual parts might actually be worth more than their current stock prices\u2014a paradox in the ongoing antitrust debate.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) experienced significant growth in Q2 2024, with a 15% year-over-year revenue increase and a 31% rise in diluted EPS. The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) grew nearly 29% YoY, strengthening its position in the cloud market. Despite a recent 14% drop in its stock price, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is valued at 20-25x FY2024 earnings, indicating a potential buying opportunity. Analysts have set a price target of $203.74, projecting a 25.03% upside as of August 16. Although regulatory challenges and AI competition pose risks, Alphabet\u2019s strong data capabilities and innovation provide resilience.\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of ChatGPT's recent stock recommendations. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, heck out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 30, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN and Uber Technologies UBER.\nAlphabet has been making significant strides in artificial intelligence (AI), search engines and autonomous driving technology, which, in turn, is instilling investor optimism in its stock. With a 16.5% year-to-date (YTD) gain, Alphabet has outperformed the Zacks Internet-Services industry\u2019s return of 14.3%.\nHowever, the GOOGL stock has lagged behind the broader technology sector\u2019s rally of 23.4% and the S&P 500 index\u2019s gain of 20% in the same time frame.\nAlphabet has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, making significant investments in generative AI (GenAI) technology. Its growing GenAI capabilities are driving its momentum in the booming cloud computing market and the search engine space by enhancing search results.\nThe company is also riding on its strength in YouTube and its dominant position in the search engine market, which are playing a vital role in shaping the growth trajectory of its advertisement business.\nAlphabet\u2019s expanding footprint in the self-driving vehicle space on the back of Waymo is another major positive.\nHowever, increasing investment expenses, litigation issues associated with data privacy and its AI technology, and market uncertainties are concerning for GOOGL.\nAlso, Alphabet faces significant competition in the booming GenAI market from the likes of Microsoft and Amazon, which are leaving no stone unturned to boost their GenAI-powered offerings.\nAlthough Alphabet enjoys a first-mover advantage in the autonomous driving space, it faces rising competition from the likes of Amazon, Baidu, General Motors and Tesla.\nStiff competition poses a risk to GOOGL\u2019s market position.\nGiven the combination of both risks and rewards, investors should consider the fact that how these AI, search and autonomous driving initiatives poise Alphabet well for growth opportunities in the long run.\nGOOGL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Style Score of C suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\nAlphabet is currently trading at a premium with a forward 12-month Price/Sales of 6.32X compared with the industry\u2019s 5.34X, which suggests that investors should wait for a better entry point.\nAlphabet\u2019s division Google is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLM) with its most powerful AI model called Gemini.\nGemini comes in four sizes, forming a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything, from data centers to devices. Each model of this family is designed for various use cases. With Gemini, Google offers the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to date.\nThe company offers an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool, Gemini Code Assist, which is driving its momentum among various enterprises.\nSolid momentum in Google\u2019s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is another positive. The launch of the latest image generation model, namely Imagen 3, in preview for Vertex AI customers with early access, is a plus.\nGoogle\u2019s introduction of various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure is another positive.\nGoogle offers Gemma 2, which belongs to its family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models called Gemma, to researchers and developers across the globe. It is available in both 9 billion (9B) and 27 billion (27B) parameter sizes.\nIts unveiling of LearnLM, a family of GenAI models designed for conversational tutoring on various subjects, is noteworthy.\nGoogle\u2019s continued efforts toward innovation in AI techniques for the advancement of its search segment, which accounts for a major portion of its total revenues, are driving traffic on its search platform.\nThe integration of GenAI technology into the search engine is benefiting Google Search. LLMs, coupled with multi-search and visual exploration features, are continuously improving the search results.\nThe introduction of Search Generative Experience (\u201cSGE\u201d), which leverages GenAI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, is noteworthy.\nThe company\u2019s strength in the mobile search category on the back of mobile-friendly algorithms, robust product listings and flight search capabilities is a plus.\nComing to the advertisement business, Alphabet\u2019s growing efforts to deliver better performance and profitability to advertisers on the back of foundational research models and LLMs are major positives.\nSGE is aiding the performance of GOOGL\u2019s advertisement business by helping in the creation of relevant, customized and high-quality ads. The strength in the conversational experience of Google Ads and Performance Max is driving the company\u2019s momentum among advertisers. The improving performance of YouTube ads is another positive.\nThis apart, the strengthening user momentum in YouTube Shorts is a tailwind. Google\u2019s growing efforts to bolster relationships with content creators are positive.\nAlphabet is well-poised to penetrate the booming autonomous driving space rapidly on the back of its strong efforts toward reaching out to more customers on the back of its robust driverless technology and expansion efforts.\nWaymo\u2019s strong operations in Phoenix, AZ, are a major positive.\nThe company\u2019s multi-year partnership with Uber Technologies to offer an autonomous driving experience to the latter\u2019s customers in Phoenix, AZ, is noteworthy. This deal is in sync with the company\u2019s deepening focus in Phoenix.\nThe company also rolled out a rider-only service in downtown Phoenix.\nApart from Phoenix, Alphabet made Waymo One available to everyone in San Francisco. This move marks Waymo\u2019s very first such expansion outside of Phoenix.\nWaymo received regulatory approval to expand in Los Angeles. It is also testing its self-driving vehicles on the streets of Bellevue, WA.\nAdditionally, the company is testing self-driving vehicles on the streets of Austin, TX, which was declared the fourth city for Waymo One last year.\nWaymo recently expanded its partnership with Uber to introduce the Waymo One experience in Austin and Atlanta via the Uber app. The service will begin in the early 2025.\nAlphabet\u2019s long-term prospects are expected to benefit from its growing GenAI innovations and product integrations. The company\u2019s strength in search and YouTube, which are driving its advertisement revenues, is a positive. Also, its growing momentum in Waymo is a plus. All these factors are expected to drive its top-line growth in the long run.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $292.3 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 14%.\nThe same for 2024 earnings stands at $7.63 per share, which implies year-over-year growth of 31.6%. The EPS estimate has moved north by a penny over the past 60 days.\nIn this data-driven world, wherein AI has become mainstream for most businesses, Alphabet\u2019s growing GenAI capabilities present a potential catalyst for future growth. Moreover, the company\u2019s dominant position in the search engine market and first-mover advantage in the autonomous driving space are major positives.\nHowever, growing litigation issues related to privacy concerns and AI technology, along with intensifying competition in both AI and autonomous driving fields, do not bode well for the stock.\nAlphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks.\nThe latest developments in the AI industry from a business perspective highlight a growing momentum, driven by significant investments, innovative product launches, and both regulatory and market challenges. One notable development is the rise of Safe Superintelligence, a company founded by previous OpenAI bigwig Ilya Sutskever, which recently secured $1 billion in funding to advance AI systems with a focus on safety. This significant capital raise from major venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital underscores the growing concerns around AI safety, as companies work to ensure that AI technologies are both powerful and aligned with human values. Similarly, the market selloff of Wall Street's favorite GPU maker following a stellar earnings report, resulting in a market value loss of close to $280 billion, reflects investor anxieties over the sustainability of AI growth, compounded by concerns over regulatory scrutiny.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nAnother major business development that investors should keep an eye on is the purchase of\u00a0 AirTrunk by investment firm Blackstone for over $16 billion. AirTrunk, a data center operator, significantly boosts the position of the investment titan in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure market. Data centers are expected to require up to $2 trillion in investment globally over the next five years to meet the demands of AI technologies, and the AirTrunk acquisition signals strong confidence in this growth by top investment managers. Data center expansions are critical as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic roll out enterprise-grade AI services, which demand immense computing power. For example, Anthropic recently launched Claude Enterprise, a robust AI chatbot, that caters to organizations that need advanced features like larger context windows and GitHub integration, aiming to streamline business operations through AI.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. At the recent Google Gemini at Work event, the company outlined a range of artificial intelligence agent use cases. Wall Street analysts, like those led by Scott Devitt at Wedbush, took note of this development. In an investor note, the analysts noted that they had come away from the keynote with increased conviction in the strength of Google's enterprise generative AI offerings and their emerging contribution to Google Cloud growth. They added that Google was actively working with enterprise customers to develop AI agents across a variety of use cases. Wedbush has an Outperform rating on Alphabet and a 12-month price target of $205.\nSome of the companies working with Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in this regard included Snap, Volkswagen, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Best Buy. The investor note highlighted that the six primary uses of AI agents employed by enterprises included customer agents, employee agents, code agents, data agents, security agents and creative agents.

While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks To Invest In According to Billionaires.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other billionaire-approved stocks.\nBillionaires and top hedge fund managers typically dominate the stock market, focusing on leading companies with strong track records and exceptional performance. They usually don\u2019t waste time with underperformers\u2014they target the market's elite.\nBefore diving into the top stock picks among billionaires, reviewing how the market has performed so far this year is essential. On September 18, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, lowering it to 4.75%\u20135.00% from 5.25%\u20135.50%. This move fueled a market rally, pushing stocks to a new intraday record high, and marking the 39th all-time high of 2024\u2014the first since mid-July. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari acknowledged that while the rate cut was unusual historically, shifting the policy focus from controlling high inflation to addressing a weakening labor market was necessary. Here are some comments:\n\u201cRight now, we still have a strong, healthy labor market. But I want to keep it a strong, healthy labor market, and a lot of the recent inflation data is coming in looking very positive that we\u2019re on our way back to 2%. So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to find anybody at the Federal Reserve who declares mission accomplished, but we are paying attention to what risks are most likely to materialize in the near future.\u201d\nMarket expectations point to an equal probability of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cutting rates by either a quarter- or half-percentage point at its November meeting, with a higher chance of the larger reduction in December. Overall, markets are signaling the Fed\u2019s intent to bring rates to a \"neutral\" level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth.\nFor nearly two years, bulls have dominated Wall Street, driven by a resilient U.S. economy and growing enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI). This momentum has propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to multiple record highs in 2024. Despite the surge, not everyone seems hopeful about the market, with some of the most influential billionaire investors, including Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, signaling caution. Buffett, known for his long-term optimism, has been a net seller of stocks for seven straight quarters.\nOn the other hand, billionaire investor Ray Dalio recently raised concerns about the \"enormous amount of debt\" burdening the U.S. economy. He cautions that neither former President Donald Trump nor Vice President Kamala Harris is likely to focus on addressing debt sustainability in the upcoming presidential election, suggesting that the pressure from the $35.3 trillion national debt will persist, regardless of the election outcome.\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we analyzed Insider Monkey's exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. These billionaires are founders or managers of some of the world\u2019s leading hedge funds and companies.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 34\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a tech giant operating through segments including Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. The company offers a wide range of products, including ads, Android, Chrome, Search, and YouTube, and continues to dominate the search market while integrating artificial intelligence to enhance user experiences.\nEvercore ISI recently revised its price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), lowering it from $225 to $200, but maintained its Outperform rating. The revision is linked to concerns about the ongoing Department of Justice antitrust trials and potential remedies that could see Google lose 20% to 50%+ of its U.S. search market share. However, Evercore ISI believes the impact on Alphabet\u2019s earnings per share would be minimal, with a potential market share loss of 60% only affecting EPS by a single-digit percentage, thanks to savings on Traffic Acquisition Costs.\nIn the second quarter, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported a 14% increase in total revenue, reaching $84.74 billion. YouTube generated $8.7 billion in advertising revenue, up 13% year-over-year, while Google Cloud saw a 29% jump in revenue, surpassing $10 billion. With a solid balance sheet and strong free cash flow, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has initiated dividend payments, confirming a $0.20 dividend with a 0.49% yield as of September 23.\nAs of the end of Q2 2024, 34 billionaires tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), with a combined value of $13.4 billion.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the stocks to invest in according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, we believe that there are under-the-radar AI stocks trading at highly discounted valuations that hold greater promise for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio.

        "Title": "Should You Be Adding Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) To Your Watchlist Today?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "It's common for many investors, especially those who are inexperienced, to buy shares in companies with a good story even if these companies are loss-making. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Alphabet grew its EPS by 15% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.\nOne way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Alphabet shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 26% to 31%, and revenue is growing. That's great to see, on both counts.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Alphabet.\nOwing to the size of Alphabet, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$202b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\nWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Alphabet, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$13m.\nAlphabet's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$8.8m in the year leading up to December 2023. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.\nAs previously touched on, Alphabet is a growing business, which is encouraging. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Alphabet, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. While we've looked at the quality of the earnings, we haven't yet done any work to value the stock. So if you like to buy cheap, you may want to check if Alphabet is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Will Alphabet Be Worth More Than Apple by 2025?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) market capitalization briefly eclipsed Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) several times over the past decade. But the last time Alphabet was more valuable than Apple was on Jan. 29, 2019, when Alphabet was worth $744 billion and Apple was worth $729 billion.\nAlphabet is worth $1.97 trillion today while Apple is worth $3.3 trillion. Apple is now the world's most valuable publicly traded company, while Alphabet ranks fourth on that list. Both tech titans have generated big multibagger gains, but could Alphabet perk up again and overtake Apple by 2025?\nAlphabet's Google and Apple own the world's two largest mobile operating systems, but their business models are different. Alphabet generates most of its revenue from Google's advertising ecosystem, which includes its search and display ads, advertising network, and YouTube. It generates less revenue from its cloud, hardware, and subscription segments.\nApple generates about half of its revenue from the iPhone, while more than a quarter comes from the services segment, which houses its App Store and subscription services. The rest comes from its Macs, iPads, and other products.\nFrom fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last September), Apple's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% as its earnings per share (EPS) rose at a CAGR of 16%. It experienced a major growth spurt in fiscal 2021 as it launched its first 5G iPhones, but its revenue slipped in fiscal 2023 when that 5G upgrade cycle ended, the Chinese market cooled off, and the pandemic-induced tailwinds for its Macs and iPads dissipated.\nFrom 2018 to 2023, Alphabet's revenue increased at a CAGR of 18% as its EPS grew at a CAGR of 22%. Its ad sales cooled off during the pandemic, but it offset that pressure by growing its cloud business. Its ad business subsequently recovered, but it slowed down again over the past year amid inflation, high interest rates, and other macro headwinds.\nBoth companies are ramping up their investments in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. Apple is integrating \"Apple Intelligence\" into its services to write and summarize messages, search photos and videos, and create images from text prompts. Alphabet has gradually been expanding its Gemini platform to handle more generative AI tasks.\nApple and Alphabet both returned a lot of cash to their investors as they expanded. Over the past five years, Apple bought back 14% of its shares as Alphabet reduced its outstanding share count by 11%. Apple also continued to raise its dividend annually, while Alphabet initiated its first-ever dividend earlier this year.\nApple is growing at a slower rate than Alphabet, but it generated bigger gains over the past five years for three simple reasons. First, Apple's premium appeal, pricing power, and low exposure to the advertising market insulated it from a lot of the macro headwinds for consumer spending. Google's advertising business was more exposed to those economic challenges.\nSecond, Alphabet faces more long-term threats than Apple. Google is struggling to keep pace with OpenAI and Microsoft in the AI market, and OpenAI's new ChatGPT search engine could challenge its core search engine. Google Cloud also ranks a distant third behind Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure in the cloud infrastructure race.\nLastly, both companies are being scrutinized by regulators, but Alphabet arguably faces more near-term pressure. The U.S. Department of Justice recently ruled that Google had illegally monopolized the online search and advertising markets -- and it could either break up the tech giant or force it to share more of its data with its competitors. Those threats are likely compressing Alphabet's valuations and making it less appealing than Apple.\nAlphabet trades at just 18 times forward earnings, making it the cheapest Magnificent Seven stock. Apple looks a lot pricier at 28 times forward earnings.\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Alphabet's EPS to grow at a CAGR of 20%. If it matches those estimates and maintains the same valuations, its stock could rise about 13% to $180 by 2025. That would boost its market cap to about $2.2 trillion.\nFrom fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026, Wall Street expects Apple's EPS to increase at a CAGR of just 11%. If it meets those expectations and maintains its premium valuation, its stock could rise about 8% to $234 and boost its market cap to $3.6 trillion by 2025. But if it trades at the same forward multiple of 18 as Alphabet, Apple's stock price would actually decline about 30% to $150 and reduce its market cap to $2.3 trillion.\nSo for now, it seems unlikely that Alphabet's market cap can surpass Apple's by 2025. But if Alphabet overcomes its near-term threats, it might just command a higher valuation and generate bigger gains than Apple over the next year. As for Apple, it will need to dazzle its investors with new products and services to support its higher valuation.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 15 AI Stocks That Are On Sale. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks that are on sale.\nBig tech, specifically artificial intelligence, is the sector that many are starting to consider as the best-performing sector of the market in the second quarter of 2024. The concentration of the major players in this space has been in the large-cap companies since your ability to fully develop AI and benefit from its profitability really depends on the scale of your business. Basically, the bigger a company is, the better it will be positioned within the AI-led market this year. Because of this phenomenon, big tech companies, with all the money in the world to invest in AI development, are ensuring that this revolutionary tech drives the overall tech sector to record highs in 2024.\nAccording to Alex Kantrowitz, Founder of Big Technology, these trends can be expected to lift up other sectors in the market that have a strong relationship with AI. One such sector is energy, which, according to Kantrowitz, is going to be seeing a lot more demand from customers that are developing AI and creating and training Large Language Models. While many players in the AI space today are also working on finding ways to use energy for AI development more efficiently, the general consensus seems to be that there\u2019s a need to tap into more existing sources of energy until such methods are found. Because of this, the markets may see demand for nuclear energy rise to unprecedented levels as well.\nAnother sector that might catch the AI draft and be propelled higher is digital advertising. With the rise of AI-powered marketing clouds, many advertisement-focused businesses are beginning to see immense increases in their return on investment. According to David Steinberg, the CEO of Zeta Global, AI is leading to immense growth within the advertising ecosystem, with Steinberg expecting growth in low double-digits this year. He noted that the launch of ChatGPT was the \u201cbig renaissance moment\u201d for AI, which changed our perception of this technology from being a figment of science fiction to something serious enough to be discussed in company board rooms. Because of this, Steinberg believes that every company out there in advertisement and retail is pivoting its business to incorporate high-quality enterprise AI usages in its operations.\nPart of the reason why AI is taking over the market in this manner is the promise it makes \u2013 efficiency coupled with revenue growth. By focusing on AI development and integration, businesses across the globe can increase their efficiency while also generating higher profits for themselves and their shareholders. Considering this, and the fact that AI stocks have been performing exceptionally well in the second quarter, we have compiled a list of some AI stocks on sale that investors may wish to consider for their portfolios this year.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nWe first compiled a list of 40 AI stocks by sifting through ETFs and online rankings, including our own rankings. We then selected the 15 stocks with P/E ratios lower than the S&P 500\u2019s P/E of 24.1 as of September 27 (according to data from WSJ) and with expected EPS growth for this year. The stocks are ranked based on their P/E ratios, from the highest to the lowest. We also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock, as of the second quarter.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\nExpected Earnings Growth: 31.9%\nP/E Ratio: 21.6\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a big tech company offering interactive media and communication services. It is based in Mountain View, California. The company is an active player and pioneer in the AI space is also behind Gemini, a major Large Language Model. Moreover, its Google Cloud Platform is among the top choices for enterprises and developers for building AI and ML applications.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a company with immense financial fortitude since it has managed to generate significant profits since its IPO 20 years ago. The company reported $23.5 billion in net income in the second quarter alone, which translated to a net profit margin of 28%. With this much financial stability, the company\u2019s involvement in the AI space has made many investors consider it among the top AI stocks to buy.\nToday, almost all of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) products and services have AI integrated into them. A few examples of its existing AI-enhanced offerings include Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail, and the Google Cloud. With plans to invest at least $12 billion per quarter on capital expenditures, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is expected to take its AI integration even further to its own and its shareholders\u2019 benefit.\nConsidering these factors, the company\u2019s current valuation and P/E ratio of merely 23.5 points makes Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) quite a steal in the AI market today.\nThere were 165 hedge funds long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $22.01 billion.\nDiamond Hill Capital\u00a0mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second-quarter 2024 investor\u00a0letter:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon, Texas Instruments and\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). Media and technology company Alphabet also continued delivering strong results in its search, YouTube advertising, YouTube subscription and cloud businesses. Shares rose amid an environment that continues favoring mega-cap technology companies.\u201d\nOverall GOOG ranks 14th on our list of AI stocks that are on sale. While GOOG is an exceptional investment, we believe that AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG and which trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other holding company stocks.\nSome may think the Fed meeting on the 18th of September may have put an end to the basis point cut debate, however, while the Fed did initiate a rate cut by half a percentage, two Fed meetings are remaining before the end of 2024. To discuss the likely rate cut path, Chris Versace, Tematica Research CIO, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance on September 24.\nVersace suggests that it is quite impossible to predict the path the Fed is to adopt before 2024 ends and the decision will likely be more reliant on data. The labor market weakened for the second consecutive month and, according to him, the Fed will probably go for another 50 basis point cut, if not more.\nHe urges investors and traders to triangulate all data points to make decisions including economic data, inflation data, and the speed at which the economy is growing. Versace states that the market right now is stretched and that there is more to the bigger picture such as the upcoming elections, earnings growth, and the Fed's decisions.\nOn September 25, Burns McKinney, NFJ Investment Group Managing Director & Senior Portfolio Manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the market outlook. Amid declining consumer confidence and a shrinking job market, volatility, according to him, will remain a constant element.\nHe suggested that signs of job weakness coupled with inflation have impacted consumer confidence negatively, especially after the Fed's decision. McKinney added that there is a disequilibrium in the number of jobs vacant and the number of workers available right now, leading to weakened employment data.\nFrom an investor standpoint, he deems volatility a constant state of the market, given that the country also has an upcoming election in the coming weeks. In addition to that, geopolitical tensions in Europe and the Middle East will likely add to the turmoil. McKinney shares that investors should focus more on dividend-paying stocks to remain secure and resilient through the volatility.\nDespite the turmoil, some stocks may always be promising given their strong footing and dominance in the industry. With that, let's take a look at the 10 best holding company stocks to buy now.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 best holding company stocks to buy now, we examined multiple rankings on the internet and our rankings. We then ranked the top 10 based on the largest number of hedge fund holders at the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the best holding company stocks to buy now. The company owns several subsidiaries including Waymo, Verily, BufferBox, and Google.\nThe company is relentlessly working to improve the Gemini experience and is also actively involved in developing AI hardware, launching its NVIDIA chip rival in May. In addition to that, the company saw significant growth in its computer hardware segment. While Google\u2019s tensor processing units (TPU) only account for almost 20% of the market, its advancements promise higher market shares. Moreover, its six-generation chips are 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of processors. The new chip will be made available to Google Cloud users by the end of 2024.\nOverall, the company\u2019s new AI models and algorithms are 100 times more efficient compared to 18 months ago.\u00a0Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) logged revenue worth $85 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, driven by the growing momentum in cloud and search. Additionally, over 60% of generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud.\nOne can infer that the technology holding company is well-positioned to exploit the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment. Analysts 12-month median price target of $205 points to a 26% upside from current levels. Overall, GOOGL was held by 216 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 and Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder with a position worth $8.86 billion.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\"\nAnalysts are bullish on GOOGL and their 12-month median price target of $205 points to a 26% upside from current levels. Overall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Of those, Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $8.86 billion.\nOverall GOOG ranks 1st on our list of the best holding company stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "No news wasn't really good news for Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) on Tuesday. It's safe to say the mighty tech company doesn't like being reminded of its woes in the regulatory sphere, particularly with its antitrust fight against the federal government's Department of Justice (DOJ). Yet a clutch of analysts at an influential financial services company again put it on Alphabet's radar with a new, not overly positive analysis.\nBefore market open, Morgan Stanley published a client note outlining four potential outcomes of the Alphabet antitrust case, which it lost in early August. None of the quartet envisions the tech giant escaping without at least some damage from the situation.\nIn the first, least severe scenario, Alphabet's foundational search business, Google, would be mandated to remove exclusivity clauses from its distribution screens. It would be required to implement choice screens, allowing users to choose their search engine instead of defaulting to Google. The Morgan Stanley team feels this is the best-case scenario, citing data from Europe, where the choice screen is required, showing that Google nevertheless maintains a more than 97% market share on that continent.\nIn the second and third scenarios, Alphabet would be forced to make more significant changes. These include auction pricing restrictions and more extensive removal of exclusivity clauses. In the bank's view, this could open the door for well-financed competitors like Microsoft's Bing to grab market share in search.\nIn the most severe future scenario for Alphabet's search efforts, according to Morgan Stanley, the DoJ would place restrictions on the company's ability to pay third parties for distribution agreements. What this would likely lead to is hungry competitors out-bidding Google to be the default search option on major operating systems. Depending on the intensity of this competition, this presents a direct and potentially quite serious threat to Google's current dominance.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 161% in five years. It's even up 4.8% in the last week. But this might be partly because the broader market had a good week last week, gaining 2.6%.\nSince it's been a strong week for Alphabet shareholders, let's have a look at trend of the longer term fundamentals.\n Check out our latest analysis for Alphabet \nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Alphabet achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 23% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 21% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\nThe company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).\nWe know that Alphabet has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.\nAlphabet provided a TSR of 25% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. On the bright side, that's still a gain, and it's actually better than the average return of 21% over half a decade This could indicate that the company is winning over new investors, as it pursues its strategy. Before forming an opinion on Alphabet you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics.\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of undervalued small caps that insiders are buying.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

Asked whether he expects a 25bps rate cut or a 50bps cut, Lee said:\n\u201c A 25 or 50 can have both hawkish or dovish implications so I think it\u2019s ultimately whether Fed Chair Powell comes across as this is the start of a cycle they are confident that we are moving back towards neutral and whatever number they make is quite dovish and positive but if it seems like that it\u2019s dragging along the FOMC members and then there is even concerns about hard landing then I think the market can view anything they do as negative,\u201d Lee said.\nHowever, Lee said he believes the outcome would be positive.\nFor this article, we chose the top 10 buzzing AI stocks on the back of the latest earnings and analyst ratings. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPhoto by Firmbee.com on Unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nCommenting on the latest antitrust trial against Alphabet Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0Google dominance, Cramer said that the US government allegations would have made sense in the past but with companies like Trade Desk, the case against Google is weak.\n\u201cBefore Trade Desk, I would have said, meaningful, Now I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s germane to the issue.\u201d\nCramer said that with a lot of competition on different platforms, he is not sure whether Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0qualifies to be a monopolist.\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels. \u00a0With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market.\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet\u2019s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts\u2019 forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) \u00a0is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe also added to\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI. During the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch After Latest Earnings and Analyst Ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss.\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market continues to show tremendous growth, with significant advances across sectors. According to a report by McKinsey on the AI industry, the AI revolution is driving innovation across industries, with investment in AI increasing sevenfold in recent years despite economic downturns in other tech sectors. This surge is primarily fueled by the growing demand for AI applications in data analysis, content generation, and predictive modeling. In particular, generative AI has drawn the most attention, revolutionizing industries like marketing, customer service, and product design\u200b. Moreover, high-performing companies are heavily investing in AI to gain a competitive edge. These firms, often referred to as AI high performers, allocate a significant portion of their digital budgets \u2013 over 20% \u2013 to AI technologies. They prioritize AI not only for cost reductions but also for new revenue streams.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a033 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To\u00a0and\u00a020 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThe market for AI applications is set to expand even further, with several industry reports predicting that by 2030, AI could contribute up to $13 trillion to the global economy. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Moreover, the bank expects established businesses around the world to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years\nProminent businesses have taken note of these developments. Latest reports suggest that investment titan BlackRock, in partnership with tech giants is likely to launch a more than $30 billion fund focused on AI. The fund will invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects. The need for energy is a source of particular interest to the business community as AI models require substantial computational power, leading to higher energy consumption.\nThe sheer scale of computational power required for AI workloads has also forced tech giants to build supercomputer clusters, stringing together expensive chips, cooling systems, networking tools, and other high-tech gear to crunch data. These AI data centers will likely consume a growing amount of energy as the use cases of AI expand. McKinsey estimates that by 2025, 15% to 20% of all data center workloads will be AI-driven, compared to less than 5% in 2020. Furthermore, according to a report from the International Energy Agency, AI data centers could account for as much as 13% of global electricity demand by 2030 if current growth trends continue. Tech giants are thus investing billions of dollars into expanding their AI infrastructure.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

The chargesheet would allow the EU to impose a heavy fine on the tech giant and compel changes to the business model of Google. Product results from rivals occupying a more prominent position on different Google search services are one of many bones of contention. The penalties for inaction could reach up to 10% of global annual revenue.\nDA Davidson recently initiated coverage of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock with a Neutral rating and $170 price target. In a research note, the advisory detailed that as the company faced challenges in its core Search business, its opportunity would migrate to the rest of its portfolio, where its positioning was mixed.

The sector, characterized by rapid growth, significant investment, and intense competition, has witnessed a surge in venture capital (VC) funding over the past few months. In 2023, global VC investment in AI startups exceeded $94 billion. This surge in funding reflects the strong belief that these investors have in the transformative potential of AI across various industries. Merger and acquisition activity in the field is also on the rise, with more than 1,100 such deals in 2023 alone. Larger tech companies are actively acquiring AI startups to bolster their capabilities in the shortest time possible.\nSome sector-specific numbers highlight the AI potential in minute detail. For example, in the healthcare universe, the AI healthcare market is projected to reach $102 billion by 2028, with startups focusing on diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. In finance, AI-driven financial services are expected to reach a market value of $26.67 billion by 2026, with startups focusing on fintech, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading. In the retail world, AI is revolutionizing through personalized shopping experiences and supply chain optimization, with the sector projected to grow at a 34.4% CAGR by 2030.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nHedge fund interest in AI has increased in the past few months, an indication of the long-term growth potential of the industry. During routine interviews with the media, investor conferences, and through their 13F activity, hedge fund managers have detailed their bullish views on AI. For example, Bill Ackman, the chief Pershing Square Capital Management, has said that AI startups represent the next frontier in technology, offering unparalleled opportunities for innovation. He adds that the key is finding those with a clear vision and the ability to execute in a rapidly evolving landscape.\nSimilarly, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates is of the opinion that the impact of AI on industries is undeniable, and the startups driving this change are in a unique position to capitalize on it. Dalio adds, however, that it's crucial to invest in those that are building sustainable, ethical models, as they will be the long-term winners. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corporation believes that AI startups are not just about tech but about transforming entire industries. He notes that the challenge is in navigating the hype and identifying the true innovators who have the potential to disrupt established markets.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nAlphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0shares are trending after the company released new AI capabilities. Google Cloud showcased its AI capabilities at the Google Gemini at Work event on Tuesday, highlighting various applications of AI agents in businesses. Analysts from Wedbush, led by Scott Devitt, noted a growing confidence in Google\u2019s generative AI offerings and their potential to drive growth for Google Cloud.\nAlphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0is collaborating with major players like Snap, Volkswagen, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Best Buy to develop AI agents tailored for different tasks. The main types of AI agents include those for customer support, employee assistance, coding, data management, security, and creative projects.\nAlphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0also shared that over 2 million developers are utilizing its GenAI solutions, with a remarkable 36-fold increase in Gemini API usage on Vertex AI since the start of the year.\nThe key question everyone is asking is whether Alphabet\u00a0Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0will be able to maintain its search dominance amid the onslaught of AI search products.\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels. \u00a0With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. According to StatCounter report, Bing search engine\u2019s market share only increased from 3.03% in August 2023 to 3.91% in August 2024. This shows MSFT has not been able to make any notable dent in Google\u2019s market share.\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet\u2019s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts\u2019 forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) \u00a0is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe also added to\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI. During the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\nTop 5 Upgrades: \nMoffettNathanson upgraded Roku (ROKU) to Neutral from Sell with an $80 price target. The firm has advised clients to sell Roku's stock over much of the past three years due to a strong conviction that consensus was mismodeling the drivers of Platform revenues, compounded by \"incredibly poor financial disclosure,\" but it has softened its view as it looks into the second half of 2024 and 2025.\nDA Davidson upgraded Datadog (DDOG) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $140, up from $115. The firm's proprietary developer data showed a strong positive inflection point for Datadog, which gives the firm confidence in the trajectory of demand.\nWedbush upgraded Dine Brands (DIN) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $47, up from $34. The firm believes the company's current sales challenges are well understood and reflected in the stock's \"depressed valuation.\"\nSusquehanna upgraded Coherent (COHR) to Positive from Neutral with a price target of $120, up from $80. The firm believes new CEO Jim Anderson, and his platform optimization program, will \"ultimately transform the company's long-term financial model,\" potentially providing the company with over 1,000 basis points of net margin expansion.\nGoldman Sachs upgraded Ford (F) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $13, up from $12. There is a margin opportunity driven by the company's more profitable commercial business - Ford Pro, with mid-teens EBIT margins - and growing software and services mix, and the management's cost actions in internal combustion vehicles and EVs can help to offset industry headwinds, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nRaymond James downgraded Disney (DIS) to Market Perform from Outperform. The firm sees demand moderating at the company's amusement parks after a strong post-COVID surge and says the shares are expected to remain range bound as it contends that consumers are still digesting price increases taken in the past roughly four years.\nWells Fargo downgraded General Dynamics (GD) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $317, down from $334, as the firm is cautious on the company and Boeing (BA) into the Q3 results. General Dynamics' 2024 guidance looked tough to hit at mid-year, and since then G700 deliveries appear to be well behind plan, Wells tells investors in a research note.\nCiti downgraded Hologic (HOLX) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $85, down from $95. The firm believes current fiscal 2025 estimates are too high and will likely need to be lowered, driven by normalization of demand.\nCiti downgraded HP Inc. (HPQ) to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged price target of $37. The firm cites a more cautious view of the PC recovery in the second half of 2024 for the downgrade.\nOppenheimer downgraded Global Payments (GPN) to Perform from Outperform following analyst coverage transfer. Despite the recent stock pullback, the firm remains cautious on Global Payments, particularly as the acquiring industry remains \"intensely competitive.\"\nTop 5 Initiations: \nPivotal Research initiated coverage of Meta Platforms (META) with a Buy rating and $780 price target. The firm sees a \"strong\" revenue growth outlook from increased usage, new products, better targeting and higher prices, boosted by cost efficiencies and eventually materially declining Reality Labs losses combined \"with what appears to be an attractive valuation.\"\nPivotal Research initiated coverage of Alphabet (GOOG) with a Buy rating and $215 price target. If \"the status quo holds,\" Alphabet appears to be in a \"very strong competitive position with a deep moat\" around its dominant core search business model and an \"obvious path\" to leverage its global device presence, strong artificial intelligence platform and \"financial might\" to increase financial incentives to handset manufacturers for default AI placement, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nOppenheimer initiated coverage of SharkNinja (SN) with an Outperform rating and $120 price target. The firm notes the company's management team has executed quite well delivering consistent and well above expectation results in recent quarters, even in difficult U.S. consumer durables backdrop.\nPiper Sandler initiated coverage of Labcorp (LH) with a Neutral rating and $235 price target. The firm sees LabCorp as leading the industry in diagnostics services for decades, but with the stock's run over the last six months, Piper thinks the risk/reward is balanced at these levels.\nArgus initiated coverage of Snowflake (SNOW) with a Hold rating. The company is in a building phase as it invests in new product enhancements, particularly around AI/machine learning which are not generating near-term revenue, even though they may begin to payoff sometime in the future, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n"

        "Title": "Why Meta Platforms, Amazon, Alphabet, and Other \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Slumped on Friday",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The biggest driver of the market rally since early last year has been the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's largest companies have been investing heavily to stake their claim in the resulting windfall. However, lurking just behind the scenes are concerns about the state of the broader economy and what it might mean for the short-term direction of the stock market.\nWith that as a backdrop, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) was off 2.8%, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) fell 3.3%, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) tumbled 3.6%, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) slumped 6.8% as of 3:10 p.m. ET.\nTo be clear, there was nothing in the way of company-specific news driving these so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower today. This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to a report that suggested the broader economy was slowing faster than expected.\nThe monthly jobs report, courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that total nonfarm payrolls increased by 142,000 during the month of August, up from 89,000 in July, but well below economists' forecasts of 161,000. The unemployment rate came in as expected at 4.2%.\nAt first glance, this would appear to be good news. A weakening jobs picture suggests the economy is slowing, which makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will begin to cut interest rates next month. Thus far, the Fed has been reluctant to reduce rates until it was certain that it was winning its battle against a red-hot economy that was accompanied by relentless inflation.\nThe headline numbers show growth is slowing, which gives the Fed cover to begin its long-awaited rate cuts. However, the devil is in the details, and other revelations in the report gave investors pause.\nOne of the more troubling factors was the speed at which the labor market has been weakening. The government released revised figures for the months of June and July, showing 86,000 fewer jobs were created over those two months than originally believed.\nThe Fed has been trying to slow rampant inflation without tipping the economy into a recession, thereby engineering a so-called \"soft landing.\" The evidence thus far has suggested the Fed was on track to achieve this lofty goal, but the downward job revisions show the economy is cooling faster than originally believed. That increases the likelihood -- however remote \u2013- that a recession could still occur.\nAs recently as July, the major market indexes were regularly tapping new all-time highs, but some investors see the worsening jobs picture as a warning bell and are taking profits as a cautionary measure.\nSo, what does this have to do with Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla? The common thread that weaves the Magnificent Seven collective together is their potential to exploit AI. Each of these companies has been spending heavily to establish a beachhead in the AI revolution -- and it's easy to understand why.\nEstimates vary wildly, but one of the more conservative takes suggests the market for generative AI could be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\nThis will represent a veritable windfall for businesses at the cutting edge of this technology. However, many smaller companies have been reluctant to invest in new and emerging technology until the economy is stabilized, and today's mixed data did little to provide those assurances.\nYet the future looks bright for our Magnificent Seven companies:\nAmazon and Alphabet are two of the \"Big Three\" cloud infrastructure providers and, as such, are well positioned to provide AI services to their cloud customers, reaping the financial rewards.\nMeta Platforms collected reams of data from the billions of users on its social media platforms to develop its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which the major cloud providers pay to offer on their platforms.\nTesla has been working for years to perfect its Full Self Driving (FSD) technology, which is fueled by AI. The company recently announced that it will launch FSD in Europe and China as early as next year, thanks to the latest developments in AI.\nFinally, there's the matter of valuation to consider, and not all Magnificent Seven stocks are created equal. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are currently selling for 20 times and 24 times forward earnings, extremely attractive multiples, particularly in light of the opportunity. Amazon stock is selling for less than 3 times sales, which is also an appealing price. Tesla stock is expensive no matter how you slice it, at 90 times forward earnings and 7 times sales, so it isn't for every investor.\nThat said, if Tesla is the first to crack the code for self-driving cars, its current valuation may end up being meaningless.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Cheap Internet Stocks To Invest In Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other cheap Internet stocks.\nRecently, China\u2019s stock market has seen a sharp rally, driven by some aggressive measures by the government to revive the economy. China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy and one of the key players in the technology industry. This huge economy has faced a series of challenges for the past few years in the shape of a sharp property market downturn and a lack of consumer confidence.\nThe government measures include interest rate cuts and liquidity injection into the market. On September 24, Reuters reported China\u2019s central bank cut bank reserve requirement by 50 basis points and it also reduced interest rate by 20 basis points to 1.5%. Moreover, the bank also plans to issue 2 trillion yuan in special sovereign bonds.\nThese measures resulted in the CSI 300 index trading higher. The index closed 4.5% higher after the announcement whereas the Hong Kong Index gained 3.6%. This move by the Chinese central bank is said to have a positive effect around the globe. Analysts in the United States are already discussing the news as \u201cChina Boost\u201d. While many analysts are calling this boost to be short-lived, others are confident that this is a positive mood and will benefit the market in the long term.\nDavid Tepper, Appaloosa Management founder and president and Carolina Panthers owner joined CNBC for an interview recently to talk about the global impact of the Chinese stimulus.\nWhile drawing a comparison between the Chinese and the United States stock markets, Tepper pointed out that Chinese stocks have been trading at single-digit multiples with earnings expected to grow in double digits for major stocks at least. On the other hand, the United States S&P average is sitting at more than 20 times.\nTepper believes that China has exceeded expectations with the recent move and while quoting the government officials of China he pointed out that they are willing to do more if needed. He further emphasized that the central bank is encouraging buybacks of stocks and they are even lending money to do that at very cheap rates. This is an internal stimulus that is going to encourage consumption and Tepper believes that the Chinese government is doing everything it can to revive the economy.\nWhile talking about the global impact of this move, Tepper mentioned that the European market is already making cuts, the United States market has seen one cut already with more expected during the year, and with the Chinese making cuts Japan is expected to follow suit. Tepper thinks this is a very good scenario for undervalued stocks in China and around the world in general. As an American investor as well, Chinese stocks look cheap when compared to the market average. Moreover, Tepper thinks that the United States is not a cheap market currently, he thinks it is slightly overvalued. Though it is a tough comparison, if you compare the price-to-earnings ratio of global stock markets, the United States will find itself slightly overvalued.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of 7 cheap internet stocks to invest in now we used the Finviz stock screener and ETFs. Using these sources we aggregated a list of 15 internet stocks. From these stocks we selected stocks that are trading below the Forward Price-to-Earning ratio of 23.98 (the market\u2019s forward P/E as per the Wall Street Journal) and earnings expected to grow during the year. Once we had the list of cheap internet stocks, we then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them in Q2 2024, which we took from Insider Monkey's database of over 900 hedge funds. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nForward P/E Ratio: 21.14\u00a0\nEarnings Growth This Year: 31.90%\u00a0\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the leaders when it comes to internet stocks. At its basics, the company is an international technology hub with operations running in cloud computing, internet search, artificial intelligence, software development, and hardware as well. Its search engine Google has gone on to become a synonym for internet search engine.\nWhile Google continues to maintain it's market-leading position with more than 91% market share, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is continuously developing its AI technology. The company has launched its large language model Gemini to compete in the generative AI race. And has plans to invest more than $50 billion in AI development. The company also runs YouTube, which is a video streaming platform.\nApart from this, its cloud business is also soaring with more than 60% of GenAI startups using its Google Cloud. The cloud revenue of the company grew 28.8% year-over-year during the second quarter of 2024. Overall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was able to grow its revenue by 14% to reach $84.7 billion.\nBy the end of the year, management anticipates the company\u2019s revenue to reach $100 billion. What\u2019s truly impressive is its cheap valuation. GOOGL is trading at a forward P/E of 21 and analysts expect its earnings to grow by 32% during the year, making it one of the cheapest internet stocks to invest in now.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the cheap Internet stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Market experts believe that from 2023 beginning to May 2024 end, only a handful of the biggest and most well-established technology companies drove ~60% of the S&P 500\u2019s 40%+ gain.\nFactSet reported that, for 2Q 2024 (with 93% of S&P 500 companies publishing actual results), ~79% of the S&P 500 companies reported positive EPS surprises. On the other hand, ~60% of S&P 500 companies reported positive revenue surprises. In 2Q 2024, semiconductor companies\u2019 stocks were the critical drivers for the S&P 500 Index. The AI themes supported other sectors, like utilities, seeking support from higher electricity demand for AI data centers.\nWall Street experts believe that estimates for 3Q 2024 have seen a decline and the magnitude of estimate cuts seems to be significantly bigger than compared to the comparable periods of the first 2 quarters of 2024. Market participants opine that total S&P 500 earnings should see an increase of 3.9% from the same period of last year on 4.7% revenue growth. These estimates have come down since the beginning of the period, as the current 3.9% growth had fallen from 6.9% at the beginning of July.\nThe decline in estimates stems from the risks associated with economic downside, slower disinflation, expectations for higher-for-longer rates, and increased geopolitical risks. \u00a0Apart from these risks, the uncertainty around the US Presidential elections remains the most important factor responsible for the decline in estimates.\nWall Street analysts believe that uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election is expected to rise as the November vote draws closer. This can act as an additional headwind in the environment already demonstrating signs of losing momentum.\nReuters reported that populism, polarization, and an expected tight race can result in a surge in the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU). This is a news-headline-based index, which was created by economics professors Steven J. Davis, Scott R. Baker, and Nick Bloom. The rise in EPU takes place when an uncertain outlook about government policy prompts consumers to delay their spending and forces businesses to put a halt on investment and hiring.\nBrandywine Global Investment Management (A Franklin Templeton Company), an investment management firm, believes that this might be happening in the current environment. The firm noted that the University of Michigan's current economic conditions index remains below the expectations index. Notably, this is a rare occurrence, suggesting that consumers are anxious.\nAnalysts at Brandywine Global believe that this year's election cycle, whether warranted or not, continues to impact the US consumer, which in turn, is impacting the corporate sector.\nIn the 2020 follow-up working paper, Davis (the co-founder of the EPU index) and his colleagues revealed that the EPU index tends to increase by ~18% in the month of November during a Presidential election. When elections come close, and there is a winning margin of less than 5%, and polarized, the EPU index can jump by ~28% in election month.\nPolitical uncertainty can be a more powerful factor in asset prices, with investors focusing on the US Presidential elections. A JPMorgan survey revealed that investors continue to see political risk in the US and abroad as the top destabilizing metric for equities.\nAI fever coupled with strong earnings has supported broader equities in 1H 2024, and gains have been concentrated in technology and growth stocks. Analysts opine that some investors are still looking for areas of the market that have underperformed, and they expect that the recent rally in tech might spread into other sectors as well. Most investors welcomed the signs of a slowdown in inflation and moderation in growth. As a result, the US Fed has hinted to cut key interest rates. With uncertainties looming, market experts believe that investors should stick to the big stocks, which have a healthy track record of delivering strong gains.\nOur methodology \nTo select the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now, we used the Yahoo Finance and Finviz stock screeners to filter stocks with biggest market caps from different industries.

        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) closed the most recent trading day at $165.83, moving +1.15% from the previous trading session. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.42%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.04%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.38%.\nShares of the internet search leader have appreciated by 0.35% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.78% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.06%.\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Alphabet in its forthcoming earnings report. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.83, reflecting a 18.06% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $72.77 billion, reflecting a 13.61% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\nRegarding the entire year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates forecast earnings of $7.63 per share and revenue of $292.3 billion, indicating changes of +31.55% and +13.95%, respectively, compared to the previous year.\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet should also be noted by investors. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.02% higher. At present, Alphabet boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Alphabet has a Forward P/E ratio of 21.48 right now. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 29.59.\nIt is also worth noting that GOOGL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.23. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Internet - Services industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.84 as of yesterday's close.\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 141, putting it in the bottom 45% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this internet search leader have returned +0.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 0.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share, indicating a change of +18.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $72.77 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $292.3 billion and $325.85 billion estimates indicate +14% and +11.5% changes, respectively.\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper.\u00a0Since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look. Billionaire\u00a0David Tepper\u00a0stands out amongst American hedge fund managers for his two recent moves: his bet on Chinese stocks despite their volatility and underperformance and his early arrival at the AI party. David Tepper\u2019s passion for investing goes all the way back to his high-school days. He once recalled:\n\u201cI remember my dad had made some small investments in a few companies, so I would track them and see how he was doing.\u201d\nTepper bought his first stock when he was in high school \u2014 100 shares of a $2 stock, \u201cbut then the whole thing went bankrupt,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt was a bad investment, but that didn\u2019t deter me.\u201d\nToday, Tepper is worth about $20 billion. He was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn\u2019t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper\u2019s instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he\u2019d joined in 1985. Tepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the midst of the market crash of 1987. According to\u00a0The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World\u2019s Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:\n\u201cGoing into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short\u2014I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,\u201d he says with a chuckle. \u201cIt was very cool.\u201d Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn\u2019t do as well. \u201cI still got a raise but not as much as I should have.\u201d\nTepper\u2019s fund Appaloosa Management has released its latest holdings data and it\u2019s time to see which AI stocks are in the billionaire\u2019s portfolio. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nBillionaire David Tepper\u2019s Stake: $353,083,500 Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares slipped recently following reports that OpenAI is working on a web search product called SearchGPT. Before that, the stock fell following earnings despite posting strong numbers. Revenue in the second quarter jumped 14% year over year driven by search and Cloud. At a forward P/E of 22, analysts believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0continues to be one of the cheapest AI stocks in the market as its valuation remains depressed amid fears caused by an overreaction. Despite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels. \u00a0With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. Cloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet\u2019s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts\u2019 forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) \u00a0is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) reported robust quarterly financials, demonstrating accelerated revenue growth and improved margins from restructuring efforts. The company\u2019s core advertising business is rebounding after a challenging 2022-2023 period, when advertisers curtailed spending due to economic concerns. While this quarter\u2019s exceptional growth rate may not persist, Alphabet\u2019s performance indicates it is likely to exceed our annual projections. Following Meta\u2019s lead, Alphabet is adopting a more stringent approach to expenses. The company continues to reduce headcount and consolidate teams, aiming to counterbalance the impact of infrastructure investments on profitability. Alphabet\u2019s better-than-expected revenue and earnings underscore both the resilience of its core business and management\u2019s early success in sustainably restructuring the cost base. Notably, AI advancements are already showing promising results, enhancing consumer engagement, and improving advertiser performance. These developments position Alphabet favorably in an increasingly AI-driven digital landscape.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Alphabet, Meta initiated: Wall Street's top analyst calls",
        "Author": "The Fly ",
        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\nTop 5 Upgrades: \nJMP Securities upgraded Oracle (ORCL) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $175 price target. The company reported better than expected fiscal Q1 results, while guidance was better on earnings and in line on revenue, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nBofA upgraded Johnson Controls (JCI) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $80, up from $76. The firm cites a combination of data center exposure, valuation and the forthcoming addition of a new CEO.\nJPMorgan upgraded Delek US (DK) to Neutral from Underweight with a price target of $26, up from $23. The company has generated consolidated EBITDA of $45M on a value-neutral basis by reinvesting high multiple proceeds into lower multiple acquisitions and organic projects, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Equity Residential (EQR) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $83, up from $62. The firm sees the company's coastal exposure as a \"major positive given limited oncoming supply and healthy tenant demand.\"\nJefferies upgraded Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $16, up from $10.60, after the company reported interim data for RLY-2608. Management's thesis on higher selectivity equaling better safety and tolerability seems to have held up based on the data, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nRedburn Atlantic downgraded Costco (COST) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $890, up from $860. The firm says that while Costco's ongoing comp and market share gains should continue to drive \"decent\" earnings growth, the stock's current risk/reward profile is \"skewing less favorably given the even higher than normal expectations\" priced into a starting point of a 50-times price-to-earnings ratio on fiscal 2025 estimates.\nGoldman Sachs downgraded Nutrien (NTR) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $53, down from $69, represents 14% upside from current levels. The company's retail segment could be a source of incremental volatility and risk over the next 12 months from potential increases in bad debt expense and loss reserves relating to NTR Financial, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nBarclays downgraded Methanex (MEOH) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $44, down from $56. The firm believes the OCI ownership will present overhangs on the stock.\nLake Street downgraded Limoneira (LMNR) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $25. Limoneira's operations continue to show solid improvement, its asset monetization strategy \"still has room to run,\" and its avocado expansion strategy is increasingly well considered, but the firm believes Limoneira is \"reasonably valued\" at a $450M market cap.\nBTIG downgraded Bionano Genomics (BNGO) to Neutral from Buy without a price target after the company announced its fourth workforce reduction since early 2023. The downgrade is driven by the ongoing challenging capital markets environment, particularly for small cap companies, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nTop 5 Initiations: \nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Alphabet (GOOGL) with a Neutral rating and $170 price target. As the company faces challenges in its core Search business, its opportunity will migrate to the rest of its portfolio, where its positioning is mixed, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Meta Platforms (META) with a Buy rating and $600 price target. The firm calls Meta a top pick within the mega-cap space, citing its \"combination of emerging leadership in the most important future technology platforms and an attractive relative valuation.\"\nSusquehanna initiated coverage of Dell Technologies (DELL) with a Neutral rating and $120 price target. The firm sees two risk factors that have led to its below-consensus EPS estimates, namely the economics of AI hardware remain uncertain and the strategy for scaling AI services remains unclear.\nBernstein initiated coverage of GE Aerospace (GE) with an Outperform rating and $201 price target. As a focused aerospace company, GE is \"set in a commercial aviation market at a uniquely positive time,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\nCantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of MKS Instruments (MKSI) with an Overweight rating and $140 price target. The firm views MKS as the market leader in wafer fab equipment subsystems and substrate equipment. \n"

        "Title": "Is Alphabet Stock a Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) are up 16% in 2024 (as of Sept. 24). While that's a healthy gain, it underperforms the broader Nasdaq Composite Index.\nBut over a longer period, like the past decade, Alphabet has crushed the overall market. Therefore, with shares off 15% from their peak, there could be a rare opportunity here for investors to add a perennial winner to their portfolios.\nHere's why I think this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock is a buy right now.\nThis business has become a dominant global tech titan. And it's in a favorable position because it benefits from some powerful secular trends. The company is a leader in the digital advertising market, thanks to its incredibly successful Google Search service. According to Statcounter, the search engine has 90% of market share worldwide.\nThere are billions of search queries every day. This attention is monetized by Alphabet. With the digital advertising industry estimated to grow more than 15% per year through the rest of the decade, the company is set to continue gaining.\nAlphabet also owns and operates YouTube, the most popular streaming platform in terms of daily TV viewership in the U.S., according to data provided by Nielsen. As more households decide to ditch their traditional cable subscriptions in favor of the lower cost and greater convenience of streaming, YouTube should draw in more viewers. In turn, this will lead to greater ad revenue for the business.\nThen there's cloud computing. Google Cloud is the third-leading cloud platform in the world, behind only Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Google Cloud posted 29% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2. And even better, it generated $1.2 billion in operating income, good for an 11% margin.\nEven though Alphabet generated almost $85 billion in sales in the second quarter, which is a massive sum, it's easy to be bullish that the solid growth will continue for the foreseeable future based on these secular tailwinds. Wall Street consensus analyst estimates call for top-line gains of 11.7% per year between 2023 and 2026. This double-digit outlook is encouraging, especially considering the size of this company today.\nAnother reason that Alphabet makes for a smart investment candidate is because of its robust financial standing. This is an extremely profitable enterprise. In the past five years, Alphabet's operating margin has averaged a superb 26.6%.\nThat bottom-line performance leads to impressive free cash flow. Management has historically used this to repurchase outstanding shares. And just recently, the company introduced a dividend.\nThere's virtually zero risk of Alphabet running into financial trouble anytime soon. Besides its strong profits, the business has a clean balance sheet. As of June 30, it had $101 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, which is significantly more than the $13 billion of long-term debt the company carries.\nOperating from a position of financial strength gives Alphabet the resources to invest aggressively behind artificial intelligence initiatives. \nAlphabet proves that compelling investment opportunities can be hiding in plain sight. This is a $2 trillion business that hardly goes unnoticed. \nHowever, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21. This represents a substantial 27% discount to the broader Nasdaq-100. I don't believe this valuation is justified, given Alphabet's growth prospects, as well as its strong financial profile. \nInvestors shouldn't overthink this: Buying shares of Alphabet and holding for the next three to five years looks like a smart move.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $743,952!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": "  Ryan Vlastelica and Subrat Patnaik ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. shares have been struggling for the past two months amid mounting regulatory uncertainty. For some bulls, that\u2019s a buying opportunity.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nAOC Proposes $30 Billion Social Housing Authority\nThe Moonshot Plan to Eliminate Deaths on America\u2019s Roads\nCalifornia\u2019s Anti-Speeding Bill Can Be a Traffic Safety Breakthrough\nNew York City\u2019s Transit System Plans $65.4 Billion of Upgrades for Grand Central, Subways\nTo Build a Happier City, Design for Density\nThe Google parent\u2019s stock price has fallen more than 20% from a July peak, and recently closed at a six-month low. While most Big Tech names have partially recovered from a summer rotation out of the sector, Alphabet has continued to fall. In August, a federal judge ruled that Google illegally monopolized the search market, with Bloomberg News later reporting that a bid to break up the company is one option being considered by the Justice Department.\n\u201cAlphabet is the only name in the Magnificent 7 to trade at what we consider a discount, and it is a significant discount,\u201d said Gregg Abella, chief executive officer of Investment Partners Asset Management. \u201cI\u2019m not saying the regulatory issue isn\u2019t a concern, because these cases can go on for a long time and no one knows how to handicap the outcome, but it has presented an opportunity.\u201d\nThe share-price drop has left Alphabet trading at around 18 times forward earnings, cementing its place as the cheapest stock among the Magnificent 7. It also trades at a discount to its long-term average and the overall Nasdaq 100 index, which is trading at 25 times. Shares in the search giant edged higher, rising 0.6% on Tuesday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting to the point now where the valuation is starting to overwhelm the overhang,\u201d said Eric Clark, portfolio manager at Accuvest Global Advisors, who said he bought back some shares in Alphabet last week after trimming his stake about six weeks ago. \u201cI\u2019m feeling much better about getting paid to absorb some of that risk and volatility at the current valuation.\u201d\nThe antitrust issues in the US \u2014 and in Europe, where Alphabet recently lost a court case over a $2.6 billion fine related to shopping services \u2014 have caused some jitters on Wall Street. Morgan Stanley recently cut its Alphabet price target to $190 from $205, saying that antitrust-related uncertainty will put a narrow \u2014 and lower \u2014 band on the multiple.\nEvercore ISI\u2019s Mark Mahaney also cut his price target because of concerns around antitrust trials and potential remedies. Still, Mahaney remains bullish, saying that even in a worst-case scenario where Google is no longer allowed to bid for exclusive search distribution deals in the US, the related reduction in traffic acquisition costs would go a long way to offset this.\n\u201cPut it this way, Google could lose as much as 60% of its exclusive deal search revenue and still suffer only a single digit percentage loss in EPS,\u201d he wrote, reiterating an outperform rating on the shares.\nThe regulatory issue comes as investors increasingly question how much companies like Alphabet are shelling out on AI, and when this spending will begin to pay off. Some investors are also concerned about Google facing more competition from the likes of OpenAI and Microsoft Corp. as they try to draw people away from traditional web search and toward chatbots that can answer users\u2019 questions.\nThese issues may explain why Alphabet is relatively less liked than some megacap peers. Roughly 83% of analysts recommend buying the stock, compared with rates above 90% Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.\nStill, Wall Street firms aren\u2019t slashing their estimates on antitrust risk so far. The consensus for Alphabet\u2019s 2025 revenue has risen by 6.6% over the past three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, a sign of continued optimism about the company\u2019s prospects despite the risk of antitrust remedies.\n\u201cI think the regulatory issue has been priced in,\u201d said Jason Britton, chief investment officer of Reflection Asset Management. \u201cI virtually guarantee it will see more fines, but it has so much cash on its balance sheet that they won\u2019t be material. This is really just a slap on the wrists.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nIntel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger has landed Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS as a customer for the company\u2019s manufacturing business, potentially bringing work to new plants under construction in the US and boosting his efforts to turn around the embattled chipmaker.\nMicrosoft raised its quarterly dividend 10% and unveiled a new $60 billion stock-buyback program, matching the size of a repurchase plan three years ago.\nThe Hong Kong government is preparing to issue its maiden policy statement on the use of AI in finance, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that could catalyze the use of the technology in areas from trading to investment banking and cryptocurrencies.\nLenovo Group Ltd. started building AI servers in India\u2019s south, the latest boon for the rapidly growing country\u2019s push to become a high-tech powerhouse.\nEarnings Due Tuesday\nNo major earnings expected\n(Updates with stock move in paragraph four.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool\nTrump\u2019s Pet-Eating Rant Was an Effective Act of Misdirection\nThe Host of Hot Ones Spills the Secrets of His Success\nIn Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up\nHow a Former IRS Agent Got Locked Up in a Nigerian Prison\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Bob Karr ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Unrivaled Stocks of the Next 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years.\nGrowing a business is not an easy task. Several factors come into the picture when you talk about growth. In 2019, McKinsey reported that ~50% of the companies that enjoyed healthy and stable shareholder returns but didn\u2019t see top-line growth were either acquired or delisted. Growth is getting tougher amidst new market dynamics such as higher consumer expectations, competitive intensity, and digital disruption. Growth can only be rewarded to businesses that spot opportunities at hyper-granular levels and then seize them quickly.\nWarren Buffett, the billionaire CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., mentioned that he tends to rate businesses based on their ability to increase prices. He pays so much attention to the pricing power that he sometimes doesn\u2019t even consider the people who are managing the business. Buffett has had a successful career of stock picking and takeovers.\nThe veteran investor has bought companies in the business of railroads and electricity producers, whose pricing power comes from a dearth of competitive options available to their clients. Buffett has also built stakes in several consumer discretionary companies relying on the appeal of their brands to bring in customers.\nWall Street analysts expect that S&P 500 companies are expected to report steady earnings growth in 2024. They anticipate a ~5.4% earnings growth in 3Q 2024 and over ~15% earnings growth in 4Q 2024. The S&P 500\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio sits at ~22.40x as of August 30. The 10-year average forward price-to-earnings ratio came at ~17.9x, suggesting that the stock valuations might be slightly stretched.\nMoving forward, the US presidential election remains the most significant potential market catalyst for 2H 2024. Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management believes that inflation numbers might surprise to the upside towards the end of 2024 and into 2025. This is because year over year comparables might become more difficult and the effects of increased Chinese shipping rates start reflecting in the inflation data points.\nA \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d backdrop favoured larger and higher-quality companies that are less cyclical and rate-sensitive. Such companies were supported by mania in Artificial Intelligence/Large Language Models (AI/LLM) stocks. JPMorgan believes that, in the US equities, momentum crowding and stock market concentration reached multi-decade extremes.\nMarket volatility in the US remains low, with VIX averaging only ~14 for the year to July 2024. This was mainly because of fundamental and technical factors, such as rising markets, risk complacency, and lower realized correlation, among others.\nIn Europe and other areas, the broader equities were supported by improved economic activity and the expectation of multiple Fed cuts at the start of 2024. However, the growth-policy trade-off might worsen in 2H 2024. JPMorgan believes that \u201cthere is a risk of disappointment.\u201d The large bank expects that the Fed might stay \u2018higher-for-longer,\u2019 US activity momentum might decelerate and there can be a softening of pricing and top-line growth. Collectively, this might hurt earnings delivery in 2H 2024. Therefore, investing in stocks with wide economic moats and companies having significant market share should help offset the losses in the remainder of 2024.\nOur methodology\nTo list 10 unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years, we sifted through wide moat ETFs and checked online rankings. Next, we narrowed our list by filtering out the companies that have held a near-monopoly status for years or decades. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that hold them, as of 2Q 2024\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nNumber of hedge fund holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a holding company and the internet media giant, Google, is its wholly-owned subsidiary.\nThe internet giant enjoys a wide economic moat given its durable competitive advantages, which are derived from its intangible assets, and its network effect. Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) possesses significant intangible assets with its overall technological expertise concerning algorithms and AI (machine learning and deep learning), and access to and accumulation of valuable data for advertisers. Regardless of its actual technological competency, the company\u2019s search engine is regarded as being the most advanced in the industry. As a result of these factors, Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) retains an\u00a0impressive share of just over ~80.0% of the global desktop search market.\nMoving forward, Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s revenues are expected to be primarily supported by continued growth in digital ad spending from Asia-based retailers. Also, YouTube should benefit from strong reach and usage frequency. Its video-only content format is attractive to the brand advertisers.\nAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) should be able to defend its search dominance over the next decade with its own AI technology. The company is focused on investing in AI to drive growth throughout its offerings, such as advertising and Cloud.\nAnalysts at Wolfe Research initiated coverage on the shares of Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) on 16th\u00a0July. They gave an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating, with a price target of $240.00 per share.\nPatient Capital Management, a value investing firm, released its 2Q 2024 investor letter and mentioned Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL).\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first-quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding), and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising, and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well-positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the unrivaled stocks of the next 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) surprised investors earlier in 2024 by announcing its first-ever dividend along with its first-quarter earnings report.\nManagement announced a $0.20 dividend, payable to shareholders of record as of June 10, and with the actual dividend payment occurring on June 17. A few months later, Alphabet announced another quarterly dividend, also of $0.20 per share, payable in mid-September.\nSo far, these are the only two dividends Alphabet has declared. However, it would be a surprise if it didn't declare another quarterly dividend to be paid in December when it releases its next financial report. Assuming the dividend rate stays the same in the next quarter, Alphabet will have paid $0.60 per share in dividends in 2024.\nThere are 12.48 billion shares of Alphabet stock outstanding, which implies that the company will pay a total of $7.5 billion in dividends this year.\nTo be sure, Alphabet just started paying dividends, and we have no idea exactly what the company has planned for the future. However, Alphabet has well over $100 billion in cash on its balance sheet, the current dividend represents a low 0.5% dividend yield, and management has made it clear that it is prioritizing the return of capital to investors.\nFor the time being, stock buybacks (repurchases) seem to be the main mechanism of doing this. At the same time as it announced its first-ever dividend, Alphabet's management also announced a new $70 billion repurchase authorization, which far exceeds its annualized dividend rate.\nHowever, with steadily growing cash flows, and increasingly limited opportunities to use its money to reinvest directly into its business, it wouldn't be a surprise to see Alphabet's dividend grow in the coming years.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "In the latest market close, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) reached $167.15, with a +1.13% movement compared to the previous day. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.42%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.04%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.38%.\nComing into today, shares of the company had gained 0.11% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 1.78%, while the S&P 500 gained 2.06%.\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Alphabet Inc. in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $1.83, reflecting a 18.06% increase from the same quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $72.78 billion, up 13.62% from the year-ago period.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.63 per share and revenue of $292.21 billion. These totals would mark changes of +31.55% and +13.92%, respectively, from last year.\nFurthermore, it would be beneficial for investors to monitor any recent shifts in analyst projections for Alphabet Inc. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.03% increase. Alphabet Inc. is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\nWith respect to valuation, Alphabet Inc. is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 21.65. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 29.59, so one might conclude that Alphabet Inc. is trading at a discount comparatively.\nWe can additionally observe that GOOG currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.22.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nJim Cramer often reflects on how he would reform the American education system if it were up to him. According to him, one major change would be to incorporate personal finance education into high school curriculums. He compares this to mandatory health classes that teach practical skills, like dissection, which he finds less relevant compared to financial literacy.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Cramer emphasizes that understanding money is crucial, and not caring about it doesn't make someone virtuous; rather, it can lead to real-life problems like poor credit affecting personal and financial decisions, such as buying a car or a house. He notes that while conventional wisdom says money can't buy happiness, being financially broke is undeniably challenging.\n\"If everyone in this country lost their minds and decided to turn America into Cramerica, you better believe I would make some changes. So, what would the 18th premiere of Jim Cramer look like? Hey, for those of you who didn\u2019t get that reference, Google is your best friend. But because this is a show about money, let\u2019s stick to the more mainstream elements of the Cramerican regime. For starters, it drives me nuts that we don\u2019t really teach our young people how to handle their money. Would it be so crazy if you had to take a class on personal finance before you could graduate from high school? I mean, like those awkward health classes where they show you how to dissect a frog. I mean, come on!\nReflecting on his own experiences, Cramer recalls living in a car while still managing to save for retirement, which he views as a significant accomplishment. He encourages young people to invest early to achieve financial freedom and avoid dependency on their next paycheck. Through the CNBC Investing Club, he aims to guide young investors in managing their finances effectively.\n\"These things matter in life. They say money can't buy happiness, but I've always found that piece of cliche conventional wisdom to be dubious at best. Because, hey, listen, being broke is a major buzzkill, as I know firsthand from the time I spent living in my '78 Ford Fairmont for six months in California. I wish I had an expert to guide me through all this stuff back then. Although I still put money away for retirement while living in my car, I took it out of my homeowner's budget.\nJim Cramer observes that many people begin saving and investing too late, complicating their financial lives more than necessary as they age. He also notes that younger individuals often feel they have plenty of time, sometimes starting to invest before they\u2019re truly prepared. Cramer believes there are more prudent uses for their money at that stage.\n\"Too many people start saving and investing too late, making their lives a lot more difficult than they need to be as they get older. But I also know many young people feel that they have all the time in the world. Some start investing before they're truly ready when there are, in fact, better things for them to do with their money.\"\nCramer then offers three key lessons for young investors, especially recent college graduates. First, he stresses the importance of saving money, even if it\u2019s not intuitive. He suggests investing in the stock market as a way to save, which can be more engaging than just keeping money in a savings account or CD. Investing helps keep your money from being spent impulsively because accessing it requires selling stocks.\nSecond, Cramer advises young investors to embrace higher risk in their portfolios. In their 20s, they can afford to take risks with speculative stocks or options because they have many years to recover from mistakes. In contrast, older investors should adopt more conservative strategies, focusing on safer investments like bonds and utilities. Cramer criticizes the idea of young investors holding a significant percentage of bonds, emphasizing that they should be more aggressive in their investments.\nLastly, Cramer challenges the notion that student loan debt should prevent young people from investing. He notes that student loan interest rates are generally lower than credit card debt and advises starting investments even while managing student loans. He also suggests that delaying student loan payments could be advantageous due to potential future loan forgiveness programs.\n\"Here\u2019s the bottom line for young people just out of college: investing is a great way to trick yourself into saving money you might otherwise spend. Beyond that, remember when you're young, you can afford to take a lot more risk with your portfolio. It's never too soon to start contributing to your 401k or IRA, especially an IRA.\"\nOur Methodology\nThis article reviews a recent edition of Jim Cramer's Morning Thoughts, where he covered various stocks. We highlight ten prominent companies he mentioned and analyze how hedge funds view these stocks. The article ranks these companies based on their level of hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nMorgan Stanley suggests that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares might be stuck in a trading range due to uncertainty surrounding the antitrust case that recently went against Google's parent company. As a result, the analysts have reduced their price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) from $205 to $190 per share but still maintain a buy-equivalent rating. Jim Cramer notes that despite these challenges, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) remains a stock held by the CNBC Investing Club.\n\"Alphabet shares may be rangebound due to uncertainty around remedies in the antitrust case that went against Google\u2019s parent company last month, according to Morgan Stanley. The analysts lowered their price target on the stock to $190 a share from $205 as a result, but kept their buy-equivalent rating. We own Alphabet for the CNBC Investing Club.\"\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has demonstrated a strong financial performance in its latest earnings report. Revenue reached $84.7 billion, marking a 14% increase from the previous year, driven primarily by notable successes in its Search and Cloud segments. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s operating income soared to $27.4 billion, and net income rose to $23.6 billion, highlighting substantial improvements. The Search business, which generated $73.9 billion in revenue, was particularly strong. YouTube advertising also showed growth, with a 13% increase to $8.66 billion.\nThe Cloud segment excelled, achieving a 28.8% revenue increase to $10.35 billion and surpassing $1 billion in quarterly operating profit for the first time. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s ongoing investment in artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to boost its growth further. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s focus on integrating AI into its Search and Cloud services positions it well for future success as AI adoption expands. Despite some challenges in the Network ads segment, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s robust performance in Search, Cloud, and AI suggests continued growth and profitability.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe also added to\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI.\nOverall GOOG ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned -2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has lost 2.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.6%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $72.79 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.7%. The $292.25 billion and $325.79 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.9% and +11.5%, respectively.\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Maham Fatima ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Major Stocks to Invest In According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other best major stocks to invest in according to analysts.\nThe current economic landscape presents a mix of signals as market participants assess the necessity of additional interest rate cuts. Despite overall economic strength, the Fed has hinted at potential rate reductions due to weaknesses in specific sectors. Currency dynamics are also shifting, with the US dollar weakening against the euro, adding another layer of complexity to the market environment. Amidst this backdrop, major stock indices, including the Dow Jones, continue to hover near record highs.\nAs analysts and market participants navigate these developments, they must consider how these factors may influence investment strategies in the coming months. Recently, discussions have emerged regarding the implications of potential rate cuts and their effects on various sectors of the economy. Some experts argue that further cuts may be necessary to support smaller businesses and consumers who are still adjusting to previous interest rate hikes.\nStephanie Link, Chief Investment Strategist and Portfolio Manager at Hightower thinks that a soft landing for the economy despite market volatility is anticipated, which is a contrasting perspective amidst market volatility and uncertainty. While there are concerns regarding the performance of small-cap stocks and their ability to keep pace with larger assets, she thinks the economy may stabilize without entering a recession. We talked about this in more detail in our article on the\u00a010 Best Young Stocks To Buy Now, here\u2019s an excerpt from it:\n\u201c\u2026.She believes that the Fed is skillfully guiding the economy towards a soft landing, even amidst the expected market fluctuations before the elections.\nJohn Stoltzfus from Oppenheimer Asset Management joined CBNC\u2019s \u2018Squawk on the Street\u2019 on September 25 to discuss the difference the Fed\u2019s recent rate cut makes. It was highlighted that the S&P 500 is experiencing a remarkable moment, having just achieved its 41st record close of the year. Oppenheimer\u2019s Chief Investment Strategist has set a target of 5,900 for the index, attributing this optimistic outlook to the recent rate cuts by the Fed.\nStoltzfus explained that the significance of these cuts lies in their actual implementation after a long period of rate hikes and pauses. He described the rate cut as a down payment from the Fed to both Wall Street and Main Street, signaling that further cuts could be on the horizon if necessary. Since this announcement, the market has shown mixed reactions, with defensive stocks performing well at times while technology stocks have also seen gains.\nWhen discussing consumer discretionary stocks, Stoltzfus expressed that this sector is one of their favorites despite its underperformance earlier in the year. He noted that there has been a noticeable improvement in performance over recent months as investors recognize consumer resilience. However, he emphasized that within consumer discretionary, investors should focus on select companies rather than expecting a broad rally across the sector. Retailers leveraging e-commerce effectively are likely to perform better during the upcoming holiday season.\nThe conversation also touched on concerns regarding discounts in various sectors, particularly electronics. Stoltzfus acknowledged that value has become a key focus for consumers, which has led to increased competition among retailers. This competition allows consumers more options but may also pressure profit margins for some retailers. Nonetheless, he pointed out that many businesses within consumer discretionary, beyond just retail, are likely to maintain healthy margins.\nStoltzfus\u2019 discussion highlighted the positive impact of the Fed\u2019s rate cuts on market sentiment and consumer behavior while recognizing challenges in specific sectors. The outlook remains optimistic as investors navigate through these transitions and prepare for potential opportunities in consumer discretionary stocks and other sectors.\nMethodology\nWe used stock screeners to look for mega cap stocks. We then selected the top 10 stocks with the highest upside potential (more than 15%), that were also the most popular among elite hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their upside potential.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nAverage Upside Potential: 26.68%\nMarket Cap as of September 26: $1989.17 billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a multinational technology conglomerate holding company, best known for its subsidiary, Google, focusing on technology-related products and services, including internet search, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, hardware, and software development, and is known for its innovative products, strong brand recognition, and commitment to advancing technology.\nGoogle maintains a dominant position in the search engine market, with approximately 91.06% market share, and is continually improving Gemini and developing AI hardware.\u00a0 While Google\u2019s TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) only hold about 20% of the market, their advancements promise increased market share. Additionally, Google\u2019s 6th generation chips are 67% more energy efficient than their predecessors.\nThe company is investing heavily in AI, with plans to spend $50 billion by the end of 2024. Its strong competitive advantages, including its algorithms, AI expertise, and valuable data access, position it well for future growth in this segment. Over 60% of GenAI startups and 90% of GenAI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is anticipated to reach $100 billion in combined revenue from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. In Q2, Google Cloud revenue grew 28.8%, contributing to an overall revenue increase of 13.59%.\nIts Waymo division is a major player in the autonomous driving industry, with 700+ cars operating in San Francisco alone. It has faced criticism for incidents like fires, crashes, and traffic violations. Despite these challenges, Waymo offers robotaxi services and has reported providing 100,000 rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix.\nThe company\u2019s strong competitive advantages, including its AI expertise and valuable data, combined with its dominant position in search and mobile, make it a leading beneficiary of the growing AI market. Alphabet\u2019s focus on innovation and cost efficiency positions it for long-term success.\nPatient Capital Management\u00a0stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 3rd on our list of best major stocks to invest in according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Alphabet Vs. Meta Platforms: D.A. Davidson Selects the Superior \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 Stock to Buy",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "It\u2019s no secret that the tech sector has been the main driver of the current bull market. Tech is heavily overrepresented in the market indexes, making up more than one fourth of the S&P 500 and an even larger proportion of the NASDAQ 100 \u2013 and the mega-cap Magnificent 7 stocks have been leading the way.\nThese are the 800-pound gorillas of the tech sector, known for their innovative products and their heavy investments in cutting edge technologies like artificial intelligence. With their deep pockets and deeper expertise, the Magnificent 7 tech stocks are among the leaders of the AI boom, and they\u2019re positioning themselves to leverage the transformations that AI is sure to bring, transformations that could be far greater than any past technological breakthrough\nBut some of these giants might represent a better opportunity for investors than others. With this in mind, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria is taking the measure of two Mag 7 shares, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) \u2013 and coming down to a recommendation on which one is the superior Mag 7 stock to buy right now. Here are the details.\nAlphabet\nFirst up, Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube and the dominant company in the fields of internet search and digital advertising. The company\u2019s success has pushed it to just under a $2 trillion market cap, making it the fourth-largest publicly traded firm on Wall Street and one of just 6 trillion-dollar-plus companies.\nEven on the top tier, companies have to work to maintain their position. Alphabet has been proactive at this, leveraging its tech experience and expertise to develop new tools and applications for a rapidly approaching future. Prominent among Alphabet\u2019s projects are multiple ventures into the world of AI.\nAlphabet is using AI to enhance the functionality of its internet search arm, combining generative AI with multimodal large language models to improve the capabilities of Google in both understanding requests and in delivering results. The company is also using AI tech in its online language translation services and in AI-powered text creation tools. The aim here is not solely to make Google or YouTube better, but also to develop a competitive edge against challengers such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine or against gen-AI content creators such as ChatGPT.\nAll of this is embodied in Alphabet\u2019s Gemini model, the company\u2019s strongest development of artificial intelligence. At its core, Gemini is a collection of large language models, and is designed to understand audio, images, text, video, and even code \u2013 all to give the most flexibility in the end use. Alphabet is working to integrate Gemini into all of its products, from Google to the Android operating system, and to put the model to use in chatbots, text generation, software coding \u2013 pretty much any form of content creation that an end-user can imagine. The key challenge for Alphabet will be maintaining market share as the search world shifts toward AI-powered tools.\nThis is an issue noted by Davidson\u2019s Gil Luria, who thinks there are reasons for caution here, mainly due to the company\u2019s uphill road in integrating AI technology into its products but also in the legal repercussions of its current near-absolute dominance of online search. Luria writes, \u201cWhile the company has maintained an almost monopolistic grip on the global Search market for years, many would argue that this dominance is under siege with the introduction of AI-enhanced search and chatbots. The rise of models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT, which has been tightly integrated into Microsoft\u2019s ecosystem, highlights this vulnerability inside of Google that despite its leadership in AI research and its massive data advantage, the company has struggled over the years to translate these assets into competitive commercial products at the same pace as its competitors.\u201d\nOf more immediate importance, the analyst sees problems piling up on Alphabet\u2019s horizon, and adds, \u201cShorter-term, Google will be navigating the transition from having 90% share in Search to something less than that as AI-enhanced Search becomes the new category. This transition will also become more difficult as it has to accommodate the DOJ charges that were specifically aimed at now allowing Google to sustain this monopoly during the transition.\u201d\nFor Luria, this adds up to a Neutral (Hold) rating for the stock, while his $170 price target points toward a one-year upside potential upside of 7%. (To watch Luria\u2019s track record, click here)\nAlphabet, like many of the major tech companies, has picked up plenty of interest from Wall Street\u2019s stock analysts \u2013 and there are 36 recent reviews on record for the stock. These include 27 to Buy and 9 to Hold, giving the shares a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $202.94 represents a gain of 27.5% from current levels. (See GOOGL stock forecast)\nMeta Platforms\nThe second stock on our radar here is the world\u2019s leading social media company, Meta Platforms. Through its main social media subsidiaries \u2013 Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp \u2013 Meta can reach more than one-third of the world\u2019s population. At the end of June this year, the company reported that its Daily Active People (DAP) across the family of platforms was 3.27 billion, an extraordinary number, and one that was up 7% year-over-year.\nThat huge reach supports Meta\u2019s core money-making business, its digital advertising sales. The company reported a 10% increase in the average price per ad, as well as a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across the company\u2019s family of platforms in 2Q24.\nIn raw numbers, that translated into quarterly revenues of $39.07 billion, up 22% from the prior year and $760 million better than had been forecast. The company\u2019s Q2 bottom line came to $5.16 per share, beating the estimates by 40 cents per share.\nMeta and its founder Mark Zuckerberg have been leading the social media wave for the better part of two decades now \u2013 but the company is not resting on its laurels. Meta is also positioning itself as a leader in artificial intelligence technology. The company already uses AI to fine-tune and narrowly target its ad impressions, and also uses AI tech in translation algorithms to make the platforms accessible across languages. But in addition, Meta is also moving into generative AI and working to expand the audience for AI generally.\nThe company has developed an open-source AI model, Llama, and is already on Llama 3. The platform aims to make AI more flexible and more accessible; its open-source code allows users to tweak the platform to meet their own unique needs, as well as to publish improvements that everyone can use.\nMeta has also released the Meta AI, an AI assistant/chatbot, across all of its social media platforms, as a direct challenge to the gen AI leader, ChatGPT. Meta AI has seen successes, and at the end of August, the company reported that the AI chatbot had already reached 400 million monthly active users and 40 million daily active users.\nMeta\u2019s AI work is taking shape in the company\u2019s Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute technology platforms. The first of these integrates the infrastructure, models, and frameworks that the company will need to put together AI apps at the scale needed to serve an audience of billions, while the second refers to the AR, VR, and immersive environments \u2013 what the company calls its \u2018metaverse\u2019 \u2013 that will let users interact seamlessly with the AI. Llama and Meta AI are the current applications available \u2013 but Foundation and Spatial Compute are where the rubber meets the road, and Meta plans to follow that road to the next generation of AI tech.\nAll of this makes Meta Platforms, in analyst Luria\u2019s view, the superior Mag 7 stock for investors to buy right now. Luria says of this company, \u201cWe see META as a top pick within the mega-cap space, with a combination of emerging leadership in the most important future technology platforms and an attractive relative valuation\u2026 Meta\u2019s strategic positioning in AI Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute signals a forward-looking bet on the next wave of technological transformation, where scale, capital intensity, and platform control will define market leadership.\u201d\nGetting to the details, the analyst adds, \u201cIn AI Foundation Compute, Meta\u2019s scale and access to massive datasets, high-performance infrastructure, and specialized developer talent offer a distinct advantage while similarly, in Spatial Compute, Meta\u2019s multi-billion-dollar investments in Reality Labs and hardware platforms like Quest and Meta Ray-Bans give it the resources and ecosystem to shape this next computing paradigm, just as Apple and Google shaped mobile computing in the past decade.\u201d\nBased on this, Luria rates META stock as a Buy, and his $600 price target suggests that he sees a gain of 12% coming on the one-year horizon.\nOverall, the Street is also bullish on Meta. The stock has picked up 45 analyst recommendations lately, which include 41 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Going by the $584.82 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for a 9% premium.

        "Title": "Jim Cramer Says Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)\u2019s New Case Is \u2018More Absurd\u2019",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s 10 Handpicked Stocks to Watch.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against Jim Cramer's other handpicked stocks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed concern that there\u2019s too much negativity in the market despite recent movements. He pointed out that while the Dow gained 38 points on Wednesday, the S&P fell 1.16%, and the NASDAQ dropped 3%, people seemed overly focused on what was going wrong. Although he\u2019s not calling it a market bottom, he suggests it\u2019s worth paying attention to what\u2019s going right.\n\"On a day when the Dow inched up 38 points, the S&P dipped 1.16%, and the NASDAQ declined 3%, I\u2019m willing to declare that there\u2019s too much doom and gloom out there. Look, I\u2019m not trying to call a bottom, let\u2019s make that crystal clear, but I think it\u2019s worth taking a hard look at what\u2019s actually going right\u2014not just what\u2019s going wrong.\"\nCramer emphasized that even though the market has been strong this year, heading into a historically tough election season and the worst month of the year means it\u2019s not the time to declare everything is fine. He noted that according to his trusted S&P oscillator, which measures overbought or oversold conditions, the market isn\u2019t oversold yet, so it's risky to go all-in.\n\"Sure, the market\u2019s up a lot this year as we head into a tricky election period and historically the worst month of the year. So, only a fool would ring the all-clear bell. Plus, we aren\u2019t even oversold yet\u2014at least not according to the S&P oscillator I swear by, which gauges whether there\u2019s too much buying or selling compared to normal times. You don\u2019t go all-in when the market is overbought like it is now; that rarely works.\"\nCramer also countered the idea that a recession is inevitable due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s struggle to control the economy. He agreed the economy is slowing, which is why consumer packaged goods and utility stocks are rallying while more sensitive sectors are struggling.\n\"At the risk of sounding too bullish, let me refute some of the biggest and baddest stories out there. First, let\u2019s tackle the popular narrative that the economy is slowing at a faster pace than the Federal Reserve can control, leading to an inevitable recession. That\u2019s why consumer packaged goods stocks and utilities are rallying while economically sensitive stocks have been crushed. I won\u2019t deny that the economy is weakening.\"\nHowever, he stressed that a Fed rate cut is meant to counter economic weakness, not strength, and hoping for a rate cut while ignoring the downturn is unrealistic. He added that if the upcoming labor report is weak, recession-proof stocks may surge, but if it\u2019s strong, hopes for a rate cut will fade.\n\"But let\u2019s be realistic: You can\u2019t hope for a Fed rate cut without acknowledging that there\u2019s going to be some economic fallout. The Fed doesn\u2019t cut rates when business is booming. That\u2019s foolish thinking. Rate cuts are meant to combat economic weakness, not strength. If Friday\u2019s labor report is weak, sure, we might see a huge rally in the so-called \"recession-proof\" stocks. But if the non-farm payroll number is too strong, forget about any rate cut hopes. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\"\nOur Methodology\nThe article summarizes a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed and recommended several stocks. This article focuses on ten companies that Cramer highlighted and examines how hedge funds perceive these stocks. The companies are ranked based on their level of hedge fund ownership, starting with the least owned and moving to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nLooking ahead, the Department of Justice will soon take Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) to court, accusing the company of misusing its dominance in digital advertising to disadvantage competitors. Cramer acknowledged that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) had previously faced criticism for paying to be the default search engine on Apple devices, but he finds the current legal challenge less credible.\n\"Stocks can\u2019t stabilize until these weak shareholders sell out. History shows that significant market drops like this tend to offer great buying opportunities. On October 25th, 2023, Google dropped $180 billion, and since then, it\u2019s come back with a 25% gain\u2014not bad, but it\u2019s the only stock on this list that failed to beat the S&P, which jumped 32% in that time.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, is positioned for strong long-term growth thanks to its leading role in digital advertising, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. For Q2 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported revenue of $74.6 billion, a 7% increase from the previous year, surpassing market expectations. Google Services, which includes advertising and YouTube, generated $63 billion, while Google Cloud revenue grew by 28% year-over-year to $10 billion.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s net income also rose to $18.4 billion, with earnings per share reaching $1.44, exceeding analysts' forecasts. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s growth is supported by its successful ad sales and efficient cost management. Recent advancements highlight Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s expanding role in AI and cloud computing. In August 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) introduced new AI tools integrated into Google Cloud, targeting industries like healthcare and finance.\nThese innovations are expected to boost Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s cloud business and capitalize on the rising adoption of AI technology. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s investments in AI, including its Bard AI platform, position it as a leader in the field. With strong financial results, a growing share in cloud services, and leadership in AI, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) presents a compelling investment opportunity with significant growth potential.\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of Jim Cramer's handpicked stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nThe past several months of market activity and tech innovation has proved that the AI trends that started with the launch of ChatGPT are here to stay and all of this was not something that\u2019d fizzle out after making headlines for some time. Companies are investing billions in AI and they expect to see the results of their investments in the coming months and years. Analysts at UBS said in a report earlier this year that if the launch of ChatGPT was the \u201ciPhone moment\u201d for the AI industry, apps like Copilot signify the \u201cApp Store moment.\u201d\nUBS also increased its revenue estimates for the AI industry in the report by 40%. The firm said at the time that it now expects revenue in the AI industry to increase from $28 billion in 2022 to $420 billion in 2027. This would represent a CAGR of over 70%.\nUBS justified its growth projections by drawing an analogy from the past growth cycles of mainframes, smartphones and PCs.\n\u201cAnnual shipments for mainframes were only about 1mn units until the 1980s, when they ballooned to around 10mn as microcomputers became mainstream computing devices. This was followed by a sharp increase during the PC era, when annual PC shipments shot up to more than 100mn units, with PC shipments eventually reaching an annual run-rate of nearly 300mn. Smart devices, which include smartphones and tablet PCs, crossed 1bn shipments during the mid2010s. Currently, annual shipments are close to 1.5bn units. With AI, we expect this 10x growth trend to continue, with annual AI chatbots and applications potentially crossing 10bn units.\u201d\nFor this article we took a look at the latest analyst rating actions around AI stocks and picked the 10 most important AI companies that recently received positive comments or ratings from notable Wall Street analysts.

Mathivanan projects third-quarter revenue of $85.5 billion and EPS of $1.86.\nWedbush: On September 9, the second antitrust trial against Google in 2024 will commence in the U.S. District Court, Devitt noted.\nThe U.S. DOJ complaint primarily focuses on Google\u2019s ad tech stack, specifically Google Ad Manager. Devitt flagged the DOJ\u2019s complaint proposing the divestiture of the Google Ad Manager Suite but does not identify other areas of the ad tech stack as specific targets for divestiture.\nThe analyst noted that Google Ad Manager represented only 4.1% of revenue and 1.5% of the operating profit of the consolidated Alphabet business in 2020.\nWhile the analyst acknowledged near-term headline risk associated with the pending trial, he noted the overall risk to the industry is limited based on the company\u2019s recent financial disclosures related to its ad tech products.\nPrice Action: GOOGL stock is up 0.20% at $156.77 at the last check on Thursday.\nImage via Shutterstock\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nFeb 2022\nMKM Partners\nMaintains\nBuy\nFeb 2022\nMizuho\nMaintains\nBuy\nFeb 2022\nPiper Sandler\nMaintains\nOverweight\nView More Analyst Ratings for GOOGL\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nALPHABET (GOOGL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Alphabet Remains Core Tech Bet But Regulatory Risks and AI Uncertainties Loom: Analysts originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Title": "Why Intel, Alphabet, and Mobileye Stocks All Popped Today",
        "Author": "  Rich Smith, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Thursday is looking like a great day to own stocks, and tech stocks in particular -- especially tech stocks tied to autonomous cars. If you own shares of Mobileye (NASDAQ: MBLY) or Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) today, you have Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) to thank for it.\nOh, sure. A lot of stocks gaining today are gaining on the back of a 50-basis-point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve yesterday. That's one big catalyst. But a second catalyst, and one specific to the self-driving cars industry, is the fact that Intel announced today that it has no plans to sell off its majority stake in Mobileye.\nThat news is behind the surprising strength in shares of Intel stock (up 3% through 11:10 a.m. ET), and in Alphabet (up 1.8%), and in Mobileye most of all -- up 15.3%!\nEarlier this month, both Intel and Mobileye got hit by rumors that the semiconductor giant was planning to sell off most of its 88% stake in Mobileye, which makes systems for machine vision in electric cars.\nToday, Intel said the opposite is closer to truth. \"We believe in the future of autonomous driving technology and in Mobileye's unique role as a leader in the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems,\" Reuters quoted the tech giant as saying. And assuming Intel is telling the truth, this means the company sees value in owning a piece of the self-driving cars industry.\nThat's good news for Mobileye investors, who now don't have to worry about a flood of their shares coming up for sale, depressing the share price even more than it's already fallen this year (73%). It should be good news for Alphabet, too, which announced plans in July to invest another $5 billion in its Waymo self-driving cars venture -- despite reporting that Waymo cost it $1.1 billion in losses in Q2.\nAnd if Intel is making the right call here in hanging on to Mobileye, it could even be good news for Intel.\nIntel of course could really use some good news right about now, after reporting declining revenue and a $1.6 billion net loss (and $3.4 billion in cash burn) in its Q2 report. With less than $1 billion in trailing-12-month profit to support its $89 billion market capitalization, Intel's hope that Mobileye, which is also unprofitable but does produce free cash flow, will turn into a profit center in the future is a bet that had better pay off.\nThe good news is that it might.\nAnalysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence don't think Mobileye will report generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profits before 2026 at the earliest. However, the driverless car unit is already generating substantial free cash flow, with $435 million in cash profit expected next year. On a $9.4 billion market capitalization, that doesn't make Mobileye stock \"cheap\" exactly. But a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 22 isn't an unrealistic valuation. And with free cash flow expected to triple over the three years following 2025, Mobileye actually does look like an asset Intel should hang on to.\nIf you're looking for a good stock to buy, to invest in the driverless cars revolution, Mobileye stock could be it.\nBefore you buy stock in Mobileye Global, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Mobileye Global wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Best Stock To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness?",
        "Author": "  Daniyal Jawaid ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Stocks To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks among the 10 best stocks to buy right now according to billionaire Cliff Asness.\nThe investment approach of Cliff Asness, through his multi-billion dollar hedge fund AQR Capital Management, is quite unique. While some investors such as\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0and\u00a0Seth Klarman\u00a0focus on value, and others like\u00a0Ken Fisher\u00a0focus on growth, Asness\u2019 fund tries to quantitatively define what quality is.\nWhile it sounds like a tall order, the hedge fund investor whose latest net worth is estimated to be $2 billion, has written quite a bit on the determinants of a quality stock. One such work came in the form of a research paper published in 2013. In it, Asness and his co authors shared three primary drivers of a quality stock. These are a stock\u2019s profitability, growth, and safety. Within these three factors, profitability is driven by gross profits over assets, return on equity, return on assets, cash flow over assets, gross margin, and the portion of earnings that was cash. A quality stock\u2019s growth is determined by the five year average growth in the per share values of the first five profitability factors, while a stock\u2019s safety is based on its beta, leverage, bankruptcy risk, and return on equity volatility.\nUsing these metrics, Asness built two portfolios. The first portfolio selected stocks based on the quality metrics, while the latter, called Quality Minus Junk (QMJ) goes long on the quality stocks and shorts the junk stocks. QMJ is more characteristic of AQR Capital\u2019s investment approach. The results showed that without adjusting for risk, the ten sub quality portfolios starting from a quality score of one and ending at ten all had positive excess returns over Treasury bills.\nThese\u00a0returns\u00a0ranged from 28 basis points of excess returns for the lowest quality portfolio to 70 basis points for the highest quality portfolio. The difference in the highest and lowest returns for these portfolios was the sharpest when they were tuned for the Carhart Four Factor Model that adds momentum to the traditional three factor Fama Factor model. The difference was 105 basis points per month for the four factor adjustment.\nLooking at the\u00a0returns\u00a0for the QMJ portfolio, these jump to 60 basis points for the four factor model for US stocks and 61 basis points per month for the three and four factor models for global equities. When the US and global monthly excess returns are\u00a0plotted\u00a0over time for cumulative alpha, they sit at roughly 425% for the US between 1957 and 2016 and at 200% for global stocks between 1986 and 2012.\nShifting gears, as 2023 proved to be beneficial to the stock market because of returns driven by large cap stocks and artificial intelligence, AQR Capital also posted strong results. As per Reuters, the fund\u2019s Absolute Return Strategy delivered 18.5% in returns in 2023, while the AQR Equity Market Neutral Global Value strategy returned a stronger 20.6% in net returns. Before fees, the Absolute Return\u2019s returns were 55%, with the net, or post fee returns sitting at 43.5% in 2022\u00a0according\u00a0to Bloomberg,\nAQR\u2019s double digit performance continued during the first quarter. More data sourced by Bloomberg shows that AQR\u2019s Managed Futures Full Volatility Strategy, Delphi Long Short Equity Strategy, and Apex Strategy gained 17.4%, 13%, and 11%, during Q1 2024. Insider Monkey\u2019s data shows that the cumulative value of the hedge fund\u2019s stock holdings filed with the SEC was $58.7 billion by the end of that time period marking a $13.1 billion or 28.7% annual jump. Double digit returns in a quarter are no small matter, and some of the best known hedge funds such as\u00a0Citadel Wellington,\u00a0Point72, and\u00a0Millennium\u00a05.8%, 5.3%, and 3.7% in respective returns during the same time period.\nBefore we get to our list of Cliff Asness\u2019 top stock picks, it\u2019s also important to see how his firms\u2019 funds have performed so far during the year. September has marked the start of a paradigm shift on Wall Street in the form of the Federal Reserve starting its interest rate cuts in the form of a 50 basis point cut. However, the Fed\u2019s data seems to have disappointed investors as it indicates that as of mid September, it expects the rate to sit at 3.25% \u2013 3.50% by 2025 end.\nWhen looking at the returns of AQR\u2019s different funds year to date, it appears that momentum is one of the top plays as of now. This is because the AQR Large Cap Momentum Style Fund has delivered 21.70% in year to date returns which is roughly three percentage points higher than the benchmark index\u2019s 18.64% in returns. On the flip side, the AQR Large Cap Defensive Style Fund has delivered 16.11% in year to date returns which are 2.53 percentage points lower than the benchmark\u2019s returns. Judging by this, the momentum fund which touts to invest in stocks \u201cconsidered to have positive momentum if it has performed well in the prior 12 months relative to other stocks in the investment universe\u201d has been the way to go so far in 2024.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to buy according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of his fund AQR Capital\u2019s Q2 2024 13F SEC filings and picked out the most valuable stakes.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors based on Insider Monkey\u2019s research. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 216 AQR Funds\u2019 Latest Investment Stake: $504.9 million Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the holding company for Google and other businesses. Its primary line of revenue is the Search business, which accounts for 58.6% of the firm\u2019s revenue as of Q2 2024. This means that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains highly dependent on Search, and any troubles for the business could create tailwinds. In 2024, the firm saw some such troubles, after a historic court ruling sided with the DOJ by stating that Search was abusing its market dominance. Additionally, the rise of AI could lead to AI based search that might eat market share away from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). However, on the AI front, it is one of the strongest firms in the world. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) designs its own tensor processors for AI use and also has access to a foundational model via Bard. These enable to provide AI training capacity to others, such as Apple, and allow businesses to build their AI products through the Google Cloud business. Patient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 7th on our list. While we acknowledge GOOGL's potential as an AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Undervalued Blue Chip Stocks To Buy Right Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other undervalued blue chip stocks.\nKristen Bitterly, Head of Global Strategy at Citi, recently appeared on CNBC's Squawk Box and explained how inflation and employment trends played a role in recent decisions from the Fed. Bitterly stated that while they had anticipated a 25-basis point rate cut due to some sticky inflation data, especially around the owner's equivalent rent, she noted that the difference between a 25 or 50 basis point cut shouldn\u2019t be overanalyzed. What matters most is the overall trajectory of rates moving forward, and as long as employment data remains stable, the Federal Reserve and the market are aiming for a soft landing.\nDiscussing rate cuts during a time of record stock market highs and low unemployment, Bitterly acknowledged the unusual timing. Typically, rate cuts happen during crises; however, she suggested that the Federal Reserve may be trying to stay ahead of a potential slowdown. She highlighted that the Fed\u2019s main focus is on employment and price stability, not necessarily on stock market highs. Now that inflation is somewhat under control, the focus has shifted to keeping unemployment around 4%.\nWhen asked about potential inflation risks, Bitterly mentioned ongoing infrastructure, CHIPS Act, and IRA spending, which could indeed lead to inflationary pressures. While the Fed\u2019s projections may be too optimistic about inflation falling to 2.5%, she pointed out that we\u2019re dealing more with disinflation rather than deflation.\n\"When we look at the Statement of Economic Projections, you might be right\u2014they could be too aggressive in predicting where inflation will be. It might hover around 2.5%, and that could be sustainable in the near future. We\u2019re not talking about deflation, just disinflation. The price increases we've seen are still there, even if inflation is coming down.\"\nOn the strength of retail sales, Bitterly highlighted a strong economic backdrop, noting $6.5 trillion in money market funds, decreasing inflation, and record profitability among U.S. companies. Despite concerns like election volatility, she believes there\u2019s still significant capital looking to enter the market, making for a favorable outlook. Bitterly predicted that the S&P 500 would likely finish the year higher, although October might be challenging due to election-related uncertainty. Historically, election years see a dip in October as investors take profits, but a rally usually follows once election results are clear.\nLooking ahead to next year, she expects a return to fundamentals. With 10 out of 11 sectors anticipated to show earnings growth this year, and possibly all sectors growing in 2025, she emphasized that tariffs and taxation are important factors, but ultimately driven by policy rather than politics.\n\"Next year, we return to fundamentals. After the election, we focus on fundamentals. This year, we expect 10 out of 11 sectors to show earnings growth, compared to 7 out of 11 last year, which was an earnings recession. It could be 11 out of 11 going into 2025. On the election front, people are looking at tariffs and taxation, but policy drives that more than politics.\"\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we screened for large to mega cap stocks that were trading at a forward P/E of less than 20. We identified 20 blue chip stocks that met our criteria and then selected the stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds, as of Q2 2024, and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of their upside potential, as of September 24.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(NASDAQ:GOOG). Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s Q2 2024 results were driven by robust growth in its Google Cloud segment, which expanded by 28%. Its core search business remains resilient despite macroeconomic headwinds. A key driver of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s future growth is its substantial investment in AI, particularly through its Bard AI platform and enhancements to its cloud computing capabilities. This positions Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) as a frontrunner in the rapidly evolving AI sector, which is expected to transform various industries and create new revenue streams.\nWith a forward P/E ratio of 18.62 and a market capitalization exceeding $2 trillion, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s strong balance sheet provides it with the flexibility to continue investing in innovation while navigating economic uncertainties. Its leadership in digital advertising further reinforces its revenue-generating capabilities, making it well-equipped to adapt to changing market dynamics.\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s combination of strong financial performance, strategic investments in AI, and leadership in digital services supports a bullish outlook, positioning it favorably for long-term growth and investor value creation.\nParnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) stock rose on the strength of robust first-quarter revenue growth underpinned by noteworthy gains in search advertising, YouTube advertising and the cloud business.

        "Title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nThoughMicrosoft has been making significant strides in artificial intelligence (AI), its stock has lagged behind the broader market. With an 8.8% year-to-date (YTD) gain, Microsoft has underperformed both the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500 index's return of 20.7% and 18.4%, respectively. This raises a crucial question of whether Microsoft's AI advancements will provide the needed boost to its stock performance.\nMicrosoft has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, making significant investments in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and integrating AI capabilities across its product suite. This strategic move has positioned Microsoft as a leader in the AI space, potentially opening up new revenue streams and enhancing existing ones. Despite these moves, investors seem to be taking a cautious stance, perhaps waiting for concrete evidence of how these AI initiatives will translate into revenue growth and profitability.\nMicrosoft is rapidly integrating AI across its product lineup, from search engines to cloud computing, leveraging AI to enhance its offerings and challenge competitors in various markets.\nOne of Microsoft's boldest moves is the integration of ChatGPT-like capabilities into Bing, directly challenging Google's search dominance. This initiative, coupled with the expansion of Azure AI, Microsoft's cloud-based AI platform, demonstrates the company's commitment to AI-driven growth. Azure AI has seen remarkable adoption, with its customer base growing nearly 60% year over year to more than 60,000 clients. For fiscal first-quarter 2025, Microsoft projects Intelligent Cloud revenues between $28.6 billion and $28.9 billion, with Azure expected to achieve 28-29% revenue growth at constant currency.\nThe company's productivity suite, Microsoft 365, is also benefiting from AI integration. Features like AI-powered writing assistance in Word and smart data analysis in Excel are enhancing user productivity, potentially leading to higher adoption rates and increased customer retention. These improvements could significantly impact Microsoft's recurring revenue streams.\nMicrosoft's Copilot, an AI-powered productivity tool, is making waves across various sectors. GitHub Copilot, adopted by over 77,000 organizations, including BBVA and FedEx, has seen 180% year-over-year growth, driving GitHub's revenues to a $2 billion annual run rate. The launch of Copilot+ PCs, featuring new system architecture and advanced silicon technology, promises to deliver breakthrough AI experiences and enhanced productivity. Recently, Microsoft expanded the Copilot+ PC portfolio with the introduction of a new silicon technology \u2014 AMD Ryzen AI 300 series and Intel Core Ultra 200V series.\nThe integration of generative AI into Microsoft's Power Platform has enabled over 480,000 organizations to leverage AI capabilities, with monthly active users growing 40% year over year to 48 million. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is rapidly becoming indispensable for knowledge workers, with its daily users nearly doubling quarter over quarter.\nAs Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI, the challenge lies in translating these technological advancements into tangible financial results. Success will be measured by increased market share in search, accelerated growth in cloud services and improved adoption rates for productivity tools. Investors and industry watchers will be closely monitoring Microsoft's ability to leverage its AI capabilities into market-beating performance as the AI landscape evolves.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT's fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $277.39 billion, indicating 13.2% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $13.04, indicating 10.5% growth year over year.\nMicrosoft's recent stock underperformance, despite its AI initiatives, highlights the complex factors influencing tech sector valuations. While the company pushes forward with AI integration across its product line, broader market concerns and macroeconomic uncertainties continue to impact investor sentiment.\nThe AI landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with tech giants like Alphabet-owned Google, Amazon and Meta Platforms making significant investments. Microsoft's success will hinge on its ability to maintain a competitive edge and effectively monetize its AI technologies. Additionally, looming regulatory scrutiny adds an element of uncertainty to AI-driven growth prospects across the industry.\nMicrosoft's current valuation presents a premium scenario, with its forward 12-month P/S ratio of 10.71X exceeding both the Zacks Computer - Software industry average of 7.98X and its own historical median of 10.1X. This elevated pricing reflects strong investor confidence in Microsoft's future growth, particularly in cloud computing and AI. However, it also raises questions about potential limitations and whether the company's performance can justify this premium in the long term.\nAs Microsoft navigates these challenges, investors will be closely watching its ability to translate AI innovations into tangible financial results and market outperformance.\nWhile Microsoft's 8.8% YTD gain appears modest compared to the broader market and industry performance, the company's aggressive moves in AI present a potential catalyst for future growth. The successful integration and monetization of AI across its product lines could open up new revenue streams, enhance Microsoft's competitive position and drive the stock further.\nHowever, investors should also be mindful of the challenges, including intense competition and potential regulatory hurdles. Maintaining a position in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock appears prudent at present. New investors should, however, wait for a better entry point for Microsoft.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of Cantor Fitzgerald's Top Internet Stocks: Best Stocks To Buy According To $13.2 Billion Firm.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against Cantor Fitzgerald's other top Internet stocks.\nThe rise of the internet and its ubiquity in our daily lives is perhaps the greatest technological innovation of the 21st century. The transformation of the internet into what can very well be described as a utility was unthinkable even during the peak of the dotcom era; however, the firms that started back then or those that leveraged it to mold their business model are among the largest and most valuable companies in the world right now.\nThe clearest example of this comes through the share price of the world's largest eCommerce retailer. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, this stock ranks 1st on our list of Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. Its market capitalization currently sits at a cool $1.96 trillion, and while it doesn't make it the most valuable company in the world, the firm's unique ability in being able to merge the high volume and total addressable market (TAM) components of the eCommerce and logistics industry with the high growth, high margins offered by cloud computing has introduced a lot of stability into its shares. So much so that its peak to trough share price fall this year wiped off 19% of its value, while Wall Street's favorite AI GPU designer marked a much sharper 27% drop. In absolute terms, this internet stock has delivered 2,077x in returns since its IPO, which is a cool way to turn a dollar into two grand.\nYet, it's still not the only internet stock that's transformed Wall Street and the world. Two other dominant internet stocks are the world's largest social media company founded by Mark Zuckerberg and the world's largest search engine provider set up by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Since they started trading, these two firms' shares are up by 1,275% and 5,608%, respectively while their founders are among the richest individuals in the world.\nThis is the power of the internet. It has spurred new industries, created billionaires, and even has its currencies through cryptocurrencies. Safe to say, the internet is here to stay, whether it's for posting memes or gaining access to healthcare from remote locations. But even though it's been around for nearly three decades now, like the broader industry, the internet continues to evolve and open new frontiers.\nWhile it's lost some steam as the world dealt with the dual crises of the pandemic and high interest rate, the advent of fifth generation (5G) internet technologies is believed to expand the use of the internet across a diverse range of industrial and consumer applications. As per McKinsey, the Internet of Things (IoT) industry could create a value ecosystem that is maximally worth $12.5 trillion by 2030 end. Within this, factory usage of IoT accounts for more than a quarter of the value pie or $3.3 trillion. Application wise, the research firm believes that business to business or B2B applications hold the greatest potential for IoT value creation as they account for 65% of its value creation estimate.\nOf course, the industrial sector is not the only one that's being disrupted by the internet. Another key area where it is making its impact is banking. One of the oldest industries in the world, banks stand neck in neck with governments when it comes to bureaucratic processes, high overhead costs, slow decision making, and slow response times. This has proven to be quite a disadvantage for banks, as according to additional research conducted by McKinsey, internet companies like Google and Tencent are already offering banking related services where they can. Additionally, banks are also being challenged by financial technology firms, with the number of such companies growing from 25 in 2017 to 274 in September 2022 for a combined market value of $1 trillion. This shift to digital banking has also impacted traditional bank valuations, with bank stocks trading at a 70% discount in 2022. The research firm believes that banks that are successfully able to transition to a digitized model can unlock $20 trillion in benefits.\nThese benefits have already manifested. For instance, by adding language processing software to its business, one bank was able to remove 360,000 lawyer hours. As a whole, it is estimated that through digital banking, commercial banks can improve their margins by as much as 25 percent. For the banking industry, these are life or death improvements as during the 15 years that ended in 2022, bank margins had dropped by 25 percent and are on track for another 20 percent decrease over the next decade.\nFinally, due to its ubiquity, internet stocks cannot be classified in one category. They range from social media firms to eCommerce companies, streaming services, and cloud providers. All these firms have their unique valuation drivers, which means that consumer exposure and heavy enterprise spending often prove to be the few broad based catalysts that apply to all firms. On this front, Cantor Fitzgerald, a firm that managed $13.2 billion in assets as of December 2023 has started to focus on some top internet stocks.\nDriving its strategy is the belief that \"despite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names are fairly reasonable and should benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth and as benefits from widespread cost-cutting fade.\" So let's take a look at Cantor's top internet stocks.\nOur Methodology \nTo compile our list of Cantor Fitzgerald's top internet stock picks, we ranked the firm's 22 internet stocks by their share price upside for Cantor's share price target for all the stocks except for stock number 17. This is because the share price target for this stock wasn't available, and as a substitute, the average analyst share price target was used to calculate the upside/downside percentage.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 165\nShare Price Target Upside: 22%\nCantor's Rating: Neutral \nCantor's Share Price Target: $190\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the leading technology companies in the world, and it owes its success to the Google Search search engine. This has allowed it to have a fortress balance sheet, as evidenced by $111 billion of cash and equivalents, through Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s dominance in the advertising market through which it serves as an intermediary between publishers and advertisers and also offers ad spots on its search engine. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s resources and tech focused nature have also made it into a key AI player and one of the few companies with a foundational AI model in the form of Gemini. Gemini allows Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) to build AI products and services, and it also enables the company to offer AI products to others. Additionally, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s tensor processing units (TPUs) are among the leading AI chips in the industry; so much so that they've enticed Apple to use them for Apple Intelligence. However, headwinds in the form of regulatory action against Search persist and could knock the wind out of the firm in the not so distant future.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOG ranks 8th\u00a0on our list of Cantor Fitzgerald's top Internet stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Global tech giants halved their business flight emissions in 2023 compared to 2019, but companies like Apple and Google's parent Alphabet are falling behind, risking a return to pre-pandemic levels, a Brussels-based NGO said in a report.\nBusiness travel last year approached pre-pandemic levels but trailed behind leisure trips, as geopolitical conflicts and a slower rebound in key markets hindered full recovery.\nEmissions from corporate flights by 26 major tech companies analysed by Travel Smart, a campaign led by Transport & Environment (T&E) dropped by an average of 49% in 2023, it found.\nWhile this shows that many tech firms are on the right path, only seven have set specific reduction targets that are essential to keeping business flight numbers in check, T&E said.\nAlphabet, which has not set a goal to cut emissions, and Apple, which set a broader target, are slowly creeping back toward 2019 levels, T&E said.\nThe two were among the worst performers, with reductions in corporate travel emissions of just 23% and 31% in 2023, respectively.\n\"How can (Google chief) Sundar Pichai say that Google is progressing to a sustainable future when its travel emissions are going in the wrong direction?\" said Denise Auclair, corporate travel manager at T&E.\nMicrosoft, IBM, and SAP, despite significant cuts, are also at risk as they are among the companies that fly the most without having set reduction goals, T&E said.\n\"Tech companies have claimed to be climate leaders for a long time and many have substantially reduced their business travel emissions, but if they want to be credible they must set reduction targets,\" Auclair added.\nAsked about its performance, Apple said it has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 55% since 2015 as part of its goal to become carbon-neutral by 2030.\n\"We're achieving this by making reductions across our entire carbon footprint \u2014 including business travel \u2014 and implementing significant cuts to the largest sources of our emissions,\" a spokesperson for Apple told Reuters.\nOther companies were not immediately available for comment.\n(Reporting by Dagmarah Mackos; Editing by Aurora Ellis)\n"

Our continued investment is a testament to the state\u2019s exceptional workforce and thriving business environment.\n\u201cGoogle data centres are the backbone of digital services that underpin our modern lives, along with tech innovation like AI. We\u2019re grateful for the collaboration with leaders in the state to not only grow our digital infrastructure here but contribute to this thriving community.\u201d\nReuters reported that Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai emphasised the importance of such investments at a time when companies are heavily investing in AI application development infrastructure.\nIn July 2024, Alphabet disclosed a capital expenditure of $13bn for the June quarter and indicated that its quarterly capital expenditure for the remainder of 2024 would be at or above $12bn.\nOther tech giants are also focusing on AI infrastructure.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks you shouldn't miss.\nAI presents significant benefits for investors, primarily through increased efficiency, automation, and the potential for high returns in specific sectors. It leads to higher profitability and efficiency. For example, AI-driven automation enhances efficiency in trading, portfolio management, and operations, helping investors achieve better returns. According to a report by PwC, financial institutions that adopt AI could reduce operational costs by 22% in the short term, which directly improves profitability. Hedge funds, for instance, have seen an increase in efficiency, particularly in areas such as algorithmic trading and risk management. A report by McKinsey suggests that AI-driven trading algorithms can outperform traditional investment strategies by identifying patterns and trends that are hard for human analysts to spot. This advantage could increase returns by 2-3% annually, which can compound into significant gains over time.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nAI tools also provide real-time data analytics and insights, giving investors a competitive edge in making informed decisions. According to a study by Deloitte, 63% of financial executives believe that AI can dramatically improve investment decision-making by providing better market forecasts and risk assessments. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, allowing investors to capitalize on short-term market movements with greater precision. Similarly, the explosion of generative AI and machine learning has led to a surge in stocks related to AI technology. Several AI-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with opportunities for growth. For instance, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has returned close to 30% in the past year, significantly outperforming traditional tech funds.\nTom Kehoe, a top researcher at Alternative Investment Management Association, an investment firm in the United Kingdom, has emphasized that AI is poised to revolutionize investment management, offering greater efficiency and precision in decision-making. Similarly, Larry Fink, the CEO of investment titan BlackRock, believes that AI will be a transformative force for wealth management, allowing firms to personalize portfolios and scale operations efficiently, which in turn create immediate value for investors. Fink was quoted by Financial Times as saying that the collapse of productivity had been a central issue in the global economy. Per Fink, AI had the huge potential to increase productivity, and transform margins across sectors, as it may be the technology that brought down inflation.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the latest and most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies \u2014 especially generative AI \u2014 has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nFinancial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs.\nThe retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases.

Analysts across major research firms and financial institutions remain optimistic about the growth trajectory of AI, predicting sustained expansion through 2025 and beyond. For example, according to Gartner, the AI software market is expected to reach $135 billion by the end of 2025, reflecting a 21% year-over-year growth. This surge is driven largely by the adoption of AI in various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and retail. Research by McKinsey similarly indicates that AI could add as much as $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, making it a critical driver of economic growth.\nA Bloomberg report also echoes these projections, highlighting that venture capital investment in AI startups has continued at a rapid pace, even amid broader economic downturns in technology. In the first half of 2024, over $40 billion in venture capital was funneled into AI-focused firms. Much of this funding targets generative AI, a subfield of AI that has gained attention for its ability to produce human-like text, images, and designs. According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, generative AI could boost global productivity by 7% over the next decade, contributing an additional $4.4 trillion to the global economy.

Investors are looking towards experts to help them make better investment decisions. In a recent commentary on the AI market, as well as the macro conditions surrounding the economy, the investment titan highlighted multiple factors contributing to market volatility, including recession concerns, pre-US election jitters, and profit-taking. Despite these, the investment firm noted, US corporate earnings have been resilient, with the S&P 500 showing 13% growth in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing expectations. The AI sector remained a key theme of this growth, but BlackRock relented that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech companies. In this environment, the investment firm recommended diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOverall, the wealth wizard advocated for broadening investment exposure beyond US tech stocks, particularly into sectors benefiting from ongoing AI buildout, while remaining cautious about Japanese equities and US short-term bonds. In the weekly commentary, the advisory highlighted that the US economy appeared more resilient than anticipated, with broad-based earnings growth suggesting stability. However, inflation remained a concern, and BlackRock expects it to limit how much the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates in the medium term. The investment firm noted that markets were pricing in significant rate cuts, but expectations seemed overblown given persistent inflation pressures, especially from wage growth. The investment titan suggested looking to European markets for income opportunities and remaining underweight on short-dated US Treasuries in favor of medium-term maturities and quality credit.\nThe investment firm also underlined the broader market backdrop in the weekly commentary, noting that US stocks fell due to recession fears, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest weekly drop in 18 months. Treasury yields also declined as investors priced in expected Fed rate cuts. The advisory, however, viewed these recession fears as overstated, pointing to US jobs data that showed slowing but steady employment growth. Analysts at the investment firm maintained that wage gains were unlikely to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target in the near term but cautioned that the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data would be crucial in determining inflation's trajectory. A surge in immigration had contributed to easing wage inflation, according to the financial firm's report, but the long-term labor supply trend would influence the Fed\u2019s ability to adjust rates.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The U.S. economy has a history of producing the world's most valuable companies. United States Steel became the first-ever $1 billion company in 1901, and 117 years later, Apple became the first company in the world to surpass a $1 trillion valuation.\nApple is now worth over $3 trillion, but since 2018, tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet have joined it in the trillion-dollar club. But I think yet another is on track to join them.\nOracle (NYSE: ORCL) was founded in 1977 and has since participated in nearly every technological revolution. Right now, it's quickly becoming a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) data center infrastructure, which could be the company's ticket to a $1 trillion valuation.\nBased on Oracle's current market cap of $429 billion, investors who buy its stock today could earn a gain of 133% if it gets there.\nLarge language models (LLMs)\u00a0are at the foundation of every AI software application. They are trained by ingesting mountains of data, and from there, the model identifies patterns and learns to make predictions. Typically, the \"smartest\" AI applications are powered by the LLMs with the most data, and the training process is facilitated by centralized data centers filled with graphics processing units (GPUs).\nNvidia supplies the world's most powerful GPUs for developing AI models. Simply put, the more GPUs a developer can access, the more data they can feed into an LLM, and the faster it can be processed. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Supercluster technology allows developers to scale up to more than 32,000 Nvidia GPUs (and soon, over 65,000), which is more than any other data center provider.\nPlus, the company's random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology moves data from one point to another more quickly than traditional Ethernet networks. Since developers often pay for computing capacity by the minute, OCI is among the fastest and cheapest solutions for training LLMs. That's why AI leaders like OpenAI, Cohere, and Elon Musk's xAI are now using Oracle.\nOracle chairman Larry Ellison says the company currently has 85 live data centers, with 77 under construction. However, he estimates the company will eventually have somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000, so it has barely scratched the surface of its opportunity so far.\nAutomation is one thing that sets Oracle apart from other data center operators. No matter its size, every Oracle data center is identical in terms of functionality, so the company is able to manage them all with software alone -- no humans required. Not only is that a big cost savings for the end-user, but it also creates a more secure service by eliminating human error. Plus, automation is the key to scaling up Oracle's data center locations into the thousands.\nOracle generated $13.3 billion in total revenue during the fiscal 2025 first quarter (ended Aug. 31), a 7% increase from the year-ago period. The OCI segment, specifically, delivered $2.2 billion in revenue, up by a whopping 46%.\nAs in previous quarters, OCI revenue would have grown even faster during Q1 if the company had more data centers online. It currently has an enormous backlog of customers waiting for more computing capacity.\nThat is reflected in Oracle's remaining performance obligations, which came in at a record $99 billion during the quarter, up 52% year over year. That was an acceleration from the 44% growth the company achieved in the final quarter of fiscal 2024. Oracle signed 42 new deals for GPU capacity worth $3 billion during Q1 alone, contributing to the sharp increase in remaining performance obligations (RPOs).\nCEO Safra Catz believes 38% of the company's RPOs (around $37.6 billion) will be converted to revenue over the next 12 months, which should help the company return to double-digit percentage growth at the top line. Additionally, she expects an acceleration in OCI growth compared to the previous fiscal year.\nOracle has generated $3.88 in trailing-12-month earnings per share. So, based on its current stock price of $155.89, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40.2. The Nasdaq-100 technology index trades at a P/E ratio of 30.7, so Oracle stock certainly isn't cheap when measured against its peers.\nHowever, Oracle's trailing-12-month earnings grew by 15% compared to the prior period, and Wall Street is forecasting accelerated earnings growth of 24% for fiscal 2025 overall. That might explain why investors are now willing to pay a premium for its stock.\nMathematically speaking, if Oracle's P/E ratio remains constant, the company could achieve a $1 trillion valuation within the next 10 years, even if its earnings growth slows to just 8.8%. But that's a very conservative estimate considering based on Ellison's comments, it could grow its data center footprint tenfold over the long term. If that happens, Oracle's earnings growth is likely to accelerate, not decelerate, in the coming decade.\nRemember, the company's data centers rely on automation, so they offer incredible scalability. In other words, Oracle should experience an expanding gross profit margin as more data centers are built, which will be a huge tailwind for its earnings.\nAs a result, I think Oracle has a great opportunity to join its big-tech peers in the $1 trillion club within the next decade.\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Serve Robotics, which delivers food for Uber Eats using sidewalk robots, said it would partner with Alphabet-owned Wing Aviation to use drones, extending the operational range to more than six miles.\nThe pilot, announced on Tuesday, would take place in Dallas, Texas, and mark Serve's entry into the market. The tie-up will have Serve's robots pick up food from restaurants and transfer it to Wing drones for aerial delivery.\nThe company's operations have so far focused on Los Angeles, where it delivers food and groceries for convenience retailer 7-Eleven and Shake Shack, in addition to Uber Eats.\nMulti-modal delivery will expand Serve's reach, enabling 30-minute autonomous delivery citywide, Serve's CEO Ali Kashani said.\nWhile drones were once touted to be the future of package and food delivery, their adoption has been limited by a lack of spaces for takeoff and landing in cities. Unlike them, sidewalk delivery robots are designed to navigate urban environments, making them a more practical solution.\n\"Through this pilot partnership, Wing hopes to reach more merchants in highly congested areas while supporting Serve as it works to expand its delivery radius,\" Wing CEO Adam Woodworth said.\nServe, spun off from Postmates in 2021 a year after its acquisition by Uber, said merchants would not have to make any changes to their workflow or facilities to accommodate robot-to-drone deliveries.\nThe Alphabet unit, which started as a project within incubator Google X, has completed more than 400,000 commercial deliveries across three continents, Woodworth added.\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Vijay Kishore)\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this internet search leader have returned -3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +6.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 0.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.64 points to a change of +31.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $72.77 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.6%. The $292.3 billion and $325.85 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14% and +11.5%, respectively.\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): A Magic Formula Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks For The Rest Of 2024.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other magic formula stocks.\nOne of the best known investment strategies on Wall Street, and one that's also followed by investing greats the like of Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group is value investing. Another fund manager who has delivered fantastic returns through a value based approach is Joel Greenblatt. Greenblatt currently runs the hedge fund Gotham Asset Management, a fund that he set up in 2008 after moving forward from his previous fund called Gotham Capital.\nGreenblatt is among the fund managers that have consistently delivered double digit percentage returns during their career on Wall Street. His previous firm, Gotham Capital, had an amazing run between 1985 and 1994. During this time period, the firm delivered a net return of 34%. This was particularly impressive, as 1985 was the year in which Gotham Capital was founded. On an annualized basis, the fund's returns were even stronger, since during the same period, Greenblatt's fund delivered 50% in returns.\nThe hallmark of a value investing strategy, as you'll understand if you study Warren Buffett's investment strategy in detail, is patience. This also applies to Greenblatt, who typically waits for at least a couple of years after making an investment to reap the returns. But while patience might be a virtue, on Wall Street, it's the returns that matter. On this front, Greenblatt hasn't disappointed, as his fund's blazing run in the 1980s wasn't its only one. After setting up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, the value investor managed multiple funds. Two of these were the Gotham Absolute Return (AR) fund and the Gotham Neutral fund. Among these, the AR fund was set up in 2012, and between then and 2018, its returns sat at 58.6%.\nHowever, while these returns are impressive, this period was filled with ups and downs for the investment vehicle. For instance, 2013 was one of the best years for this fund as it posted 29.82% in returns. These gains were trimmed down to 9.31% in 2014. While these weren't as strong as the previous year's performance, they were nevertheless in the green. This is important since the next year wasn't great by any account, since in 2015, the AR fund ended up with -10.25%. 2016 was somewhat turbulent for American stock markets since the Brexit vote in the UK, slowing Chinese GDP growth, and a commodities slump led to US and global stocks dipping between the end of 2015 and the first half of 2016. Between June 2015 and late February 2016, the blue chip Dow index had lost roughly 9% and the broader NASDAQ had bled a much higher 11%.\nThe next year would see Greenblatt bounce back. In 2016, the fund delivered 7.97% in returns and accelerated its performance later on through posting 10.03% in gains. During these same years, i.e., in 2014, the Gotham Neutral fund's annualized returns had sat at 6.83%.\nSince the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019, the stock market has been operating in a changed environment. The pandemic's immediate aftermath saw major stock indexes crash by 30%+, which then led to the Federal Reserve reducing rates to near zero levels. The subsequent low cost of capital, the boom in demand for consumer technology products, and the rise in retail investing then saw markets soar. During this time period, i.e., the bottom in March 2020 and the peak of December 2021, Greenblatt's AR fund was up by 55% while the flagship S&P index gained 103%. This might make you think that perhaps the investor, who calls his investment approach a 'Magic Formula' had lost its magic.\nBut you'd be wrong. The magic of the Magic Formula was visible during the next phase of the stock market. This was marked by the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate tightening cycle that came in response to soaring inflation. Between December 2021 and October 2023, inflation continued to rise, as the interest rates took their sweet time to make a mark. This meant that the flagship S&P was down by 13.6% from 2021 close to the end of October 2023.\nHowever, during the same period, the AR fund had gained 3.41%. A short strategy had helped Greenblatt, it seems, as the AR fund advertises itself as being 50% to 60% net long. Gotham's pure play long fund, which is 100% long, led the S&P in losses during this time period as it had lost 15.52% during the same period and a stronger 27% from its peak in November start. However, the magic was visible between the March bottom and the November 2021 peak as during this period the 100% long fund had gained 97% to nearly match the flagship index.\nBefore we head to our list of the best Magic Formula Stocks, it's also important to take a brief look at what this investment technique entails. Greenblatt's strategy is based on two metrics, the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. In a simple implementation, stocks are ranked according to these metrics, and the top stocks are bought and held for the long term. A specialty implementation is what Gotham calls its Gotham Yield. According to the fund, this is a proprietary technique that assesses a firm's \"pre-tax cash flow, return on capital, and enterprise value.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy, we ranked the stocks present in Gotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 SEC filings by their dollar value and picked out the most valuable holdings.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 216\nGotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 Stake: $68.7 million\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the mega cap technology firm that primarily earns revenue through its search engine, Google Search. Additionally, the firm also has a key presence in lucrative industries such as video streaming and cloud computing. However, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s business is still heavily dependent on Search. During Q2, $42.6 billion of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s $72.6 billion in revenue came from Search. This sizeable business allows the firm to command more than 50% of the search advertising market, and it provides Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) significant leverage with publishers and advertisement companies to divert their transactions through its platform. Additionally, it also has a foundational AI model in the form of Google Bard, which places it at the forefront of AI developments. However, despite its moat, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) faces challenges such as purported Justice Department plans to break it up and a growing preference among advertisers to choose focused platforms such as eCommerce websites.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 10 Hottest Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against Jim Cramer\u2019s other hot stock picks.\nIn a recent post of Jim Cramer\u2019s Morning Thoughts, he highlighted the impact of recent economic data on market sentiment. The S&P 500 is poised to fall for the fourth day in a row, following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. The report revealed that the U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs last month, falling short of the Dow Jones estimate of 161,000.\n\u201cThe S&P 500 is tracking for a fourth straight day of declines after the highly anticipated August jobs report came up short. Bond yields also moved lower on the report. The U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs in August, less than the Dow Jones estimate of 161,000, while the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2% as expected.\u201d Cramer said.\nDespite this shortfall, the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2%, aligning with predictions. Additionally, the job gains for June and July were revised downwards. As a result, traders are now split between anticipating a standard 25 basis point interest rate cut and a more substantial 50 basis point reduction at the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming meeting on September 18.\n\u201cJob gains in the June and July reports were also revised down Friday. Traders were split roughly evenly between a traditional 25 basis point interest rate cut and a larger 50 basis point reduction at the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy meeting on Sept. 18.\u201d\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer discussed how September 6 turned out to be a disappointing trading day. Despite hopes from bullish investors for a weak non-farm payrolls report that would encourage the Federal Reserve to cut rates, the actual report met these expectations.\n\u201cWhat an ugly day. Just hideous. We came into today knowing we\u2019d have a critical non-farm payrolls report. If you were a bull, you wanted to see weaker-than-expected hiring with wages pretty much in line, because that\u2019s what the Fed needs to see before it can start cutting rates. Voila, we got exactly what we wished for. Maybe we should have been careful, though, because as soon as we got what we wanted, the bulls vanished and the sellers came out of the woodwork, crushing practically everything.\u201d Said Cramer.\nJim Cramer pointed out that September is historically a weak month for the market due to significant profit-taking. Although it might seem circular to link September\u2019s weakness to profit-taking, it\u2019s more reasonable than attributing it solely to fears of a severe economic slowdown. Cramer emphasized that, despite the market\u2019s dips, big tech companies, especially those involved in key trends like data centers and accelerated computing\u2014should be considered as buying opportunities during these times.\n\u201cThis market has a September problem. Come September, we\u2019re always hit with a tremendous amount of profit-taking, which is why it\u2019s the weakest month of the year. I know that\u2019s somewhat circular reasoning\u2014we sell because we\u2019ve always sold\u2014but it makes more sense than saying people sold tech because they fear a hard landing. Tech, especially big tech, is something you buy, not sell, into weakness if you\u2019re worried about a more severe slowdown.\nWhy? Well, because big tech is all about powerful secular themes that can keep going even during a recession\u2014and we\u2019re not getting one. I\u2019m talking about the data center, accelerated computing\u2014they\u2019re not going anywhere. Nevertheless, when anything jars the big tech themes of the moment, the market\u2019s reaction is swift, harsh, and horrible.\u201d\nJim Cramer discussed the upcoming release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday, which will offer new insights into inflation. He noted that if inflation stays steady or falls, the Federal Reserve will have more room to cut interest rates, which could help prevent a recession and address concerns from many sellers. Cramer encouraged investors to remain confident and avoid abandoning their positions due to these uncertainties.\n\u201cWednesday, we get another read on inflation\u2014this time from the Consumer Price Index. What can I say? As long as inflation stays the same or goes lower, the Fed has plenty of leeway to cut interest rates and prevent a recession\u2014the thing so many sellers are worried about. That\u2019s why I keep telling you, please do not give up the ship here.\u201d\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\nIt appears that the Justice Department may be aiming to break up Google, as the Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)-owned company is set to face another antitrust trial starting Monday. After losing its search trial, Google now faces allegations regarding its advertising practices. Jim Cramer expressed frustration with Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s stock performance but shared reasons on Thursday for staying invested in the company, at least for now.\n\u201cDoes the Justice Department want to break up Google? It sure seems like it as the Alphabet -owned company gets ready to face another antitrust trial that starts Monday. Google lost its search trial. This second trial involves allegations around its advertising model. I have been frustrated with Alphabet stock but gave reasons Thursday to stay the course, for now.\nA bullish outlook for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is supported by its leadership in AI, Google Cloud, and search advertising, along with strong earnings growth and potential for increased valuation. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s advancements in AI, especially through its Gemini AI platform, have strengthened its position in generative AI. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s plans to monetize AI through subscription services are expected to boost revenue and enhance valuation over time.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s financial performance was impressive in the second quarter of 2024, with $84.74 billion in revenue and $23.62 billion in net income, largely driven by Google Cloud and its strong search advertising business. Analysts predict a significant rise in earnings per share, estimating around $7.50 for 2024. Currently, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is trading below its tech peers, suggesting a potential increase in valuation if earnings growth continues and AI integration succeeds.\nAnalysts have set high price targets, indicating substantial stock price appreciation. Overall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s strategic position and robust financial results provide a solid foundation for positive expectations and future growth.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor\u00a0letter:\n\u201cWe also added to\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023).\nOverall GOOG ranks 1st on our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s hottest stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Is Trending Stock Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) a Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this company have returned -4.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 4.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share, indicating a change of +18.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.63 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.6%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $72.78 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $292.21 billion and $325.72 billion estimates indicate +13.9% and +11.5% changes, respectively.\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News That Broke The Internet This Week.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this week.\nArtificial Intelligence is increasingly becoming indispensable for large businesses, providing them with tools to drive efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage. As AI technology continues to evolve, the importance it has to large enterprises is underscored by significant investments and impressive returns. For example, the ability of AI to automate and optimize business processes is one of the most significant advantages for large companies. AI-driven automation can streamline supply chain management, optimize logistics, and improve customer service through chatbots and personalized recommendations. According to a report by McKinsey, companies that fully leverage AI could see a 20-25% increase in cash flow\u200b.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic.\nIn financial services, AI is transforming risk management, fraud detection, and customer insights. JPMorgan Chase, for instance, uses AI to review legal documents, a task that used to take thousands of hours of manual work, now accomplished in mere seconds. In the pharmaceutical industry, AI is accelerating drug discovery processes. For instance, companies like Pfizer have used AI to analyze vast datasets to identify potential drug candidates much faster than traditional methods. This not only speeds up the time-to-market for new drugs but also significantly reduces research and development costs, which are estimated to average around $2.6 billion per drug\u200b.\nMoreover, AI is enabling companies to offer more personalized experiences to customers. Retail giants like Amazon and Walmart use AI algorithms to analyze customer behavior and preferences, tailoring recommendations that enhance the shopping experience and increase sales. Amazon\u2019s recommendation engine, powered by AI, is responsible for 35% of the company\u2019s total sales\u200b. NVIDIA, a leader in AI hardware, exemplifies how AI can drive business success. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported $30 billion in revenue, with AI contributing significantly to this figure\u200b. The company\u2019s GPUs are the backbone of AI models used across industries, from autonomous vehicles to large-scale data analysis, demonstrating the critical role AI plays in both revenue generation and technological advancement.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have been in the news this week. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Recent reports suggest that the company will soon roll out the people-generating feature of its AI assistant, Gemini. This feature was temporarily paused earlier this year due to concerns about racial handling. The update is significant as it will introduce a capability not yet offered by Google's competitors, available to users subscribed to paid Gemini plans, including Gemini Advanced, Business, or Enterprise. Google has also updated the image-generating model within Gemini for this launch.\nIn another notable development, Reuters recently reported that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is planning to construct a large data center in Vietnam. Data centers are critical to the ongoing AI revolution in the tech industry. To date, no hyper-scaler has announced plans to build a data center outside the US. According to Reuters, internal discussions are underway, and the facility could be operational by 2027.\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this week. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other American tech stocks.\nTech stocks have outperformed the stock market for several years and account for over 30% of the market's overall holdings. With market values estimated at trillions of dollars, the majority of the lauded Magnificent Seven stocks are American tech companies that are still expanding. Technology is constantly evolving, and investors have a lot of opportunities because of this ongoing advancement.\nThis dynamic progress was reflected in the US stock market when it rose more than 3% in the second quarter of 2024. In terms of the trade in artificial intelligence, technology companies remained at the top, and this trend did not appear to be slowing down throughout the quarter. The largest companies have outperformed the market this year, which has been a remarkable trend. The 500 largest companies' large-cap market saw gains of 4.4% in Q2 YoY, increasing its 2024 return to above 15%. In contrast, the small-cap market saw a 3.3% drop, translating into a 1.6% 2024 return.\nEven though technology companies outperformed in Q2 FY2024, Main Street Research's James Demmert cautions investors not to treat all of them the same. Instead, they should prioritize those tech firms that can deliver consistent earnings, especially in an uncertain economy.\nInvestors should also stay informed about the 2024 tech industry statistics. According to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, almost one-third of the growth in the US economy is attributed to the IT sector, which is the main driver of the country's economy. Similarly, the United States accounts for one-third of the world's information technology market, according to the International Trade Administration, making it the largest tech market in the world. Computer and IT jobs reported a median annual wage of $104,420 in May 2023, while 108,503 college graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer and information sciences graduated in 2022, a 3.5% increase YoY. The average yearly salary for tech majors is $90,000.\nAccording to a report, tech trends in 2023 were dominated by electrification/renewables and generative AI. Internet searches for generative AI increased by 700%, and the area received significant funding as huge language models processed more data and expanded modalities. Even while global IT investment declined, electrification and renewables continued to draw large amounts of capital. These industries continue to have a high volume of job postings, signifying potential for long-term growth.\nLooking forward, according to the Deloitte 2024 technology industry outlook, in the wake of current macroeconomic headwinds such as high inflation and supply chain disruptions, the technology industry confronts a cautious 2024 recovery. As per Deloitte's Q4 2023 study, 62% of tech executives believe the industry is \"healthy,\" with growth anticipated in the areas of cybersecurity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. By late 2024, generative AI is expected to have a major impact on enterprise software and elevate operational efficiency. Tech companies and startups are investing more in AI, but enterprise adoption is still sluggish. However, this is predicted to change in the second half of 2024. Market expansion is anticipated to be propelled by enterprise expenditure on AI and IT services. Nonetheless, regulations in the EU and the US focusing on data privacy, sustainability, and AI ethics continue to provide challenges, forcing companies to follow regulations while leveraging these for competitive advantage. To reduce geopolitical risks and guarantee uninterrupted growth, supply networks will need to strategically change, and effective operations will need to be prioritized.\nWe sifted through holdings of tech ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 25 American tech stocks. Then we selected the 13 stocks that had the lowest percentage of their shares shorted. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the lowest percentage of their shares shorted.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n% of shares shorted: 0.56%\nAlphabet is a consolidation of successful businesses. The company has developed into a true technological giant, producing tens of billions of dollars in free cash flow annually, with products ranging from advertising to cloud computing and self-driving automobiles. Even though the US-based tech company's major search business has been the subject of antitrust worries, investors are still confident in the firm's overall strength and expect the company to continue leading several markets, including search, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and video.\nAccording to a UBS research, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ) is a major participant in AI, with the Gemini project boosting intelligence and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud serving as enablers. As a result, the company will be poised to profit from the anticipated $1.2 trillion AI market by 2027.\nTo encourage suppliers to source all of their energy from renewable sources by 2029, GOOGL introduced the Google Renewable Energy Addendum. This aligns with Google's 2030 objective of net-zero emissions and a 50% decrease in Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions over 2019 levels.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported impressive Q2 2024 results, with diluted EPS growing 31% and revenue rising 15% year over year. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) showed growth of around 29% YoY, solidifying its dominance in the cloud market.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nThe tech behemoth has hedge fund sentiments of 216 in Q2 2024. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management is the largest shareholder in the firm, with 48,620,515 shares worth $8.86 billion.\nOverall GOOGL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best American tech stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Cloud Stocks To Buy According to Short Sellers.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other cloud stocks.\nThe cloud computing market is one of the fastest growing in the technology industry as the ubiquity of the internet allows business to digitally outsource their functions to reduce investment costs and access specialized services. Estimates show that the cloud computing market was worth $480 billion in 2022, and despite its heft, it is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% to be worth a whopping $2.2 trillion by the end of 2032. The three segments of the cloud computing industry are infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS).\nREAD ALSO\u00a013 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers\u00a0and\u00a08 Best EV Stocks According to Short Seller Sentiment\nThis market, like other mega technology industries, is dominated by mega cap technology companies. As per research from Gartner, the global IaaS market is dominated by five services as of 2023 end. These are AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Aliyun, and Huawei Cloud. Their market shares are 39%, 23%, 8.2%, 7.9%, and 4.3%, respectively, with all other firms commanding 17.6% of the total market. In terms of revenue, AWS raked in an impressive $54.6 billion in revenue, while the others brought in $32.1 billion, $11.4 billion, $11.1 billion, and $5.9 billion, respectively. AWS' dominance in the industry is clear as it brought in more than twice the revenue of all other firms that follow Huawei since their cumulative revenue was $24.6 billion.\nApart from the biggest players, whose valuation metrics are different due to their mature and diverse business models, valuing cloud computing stocks is different from how you'd value other companies. For instance, most firms are valued through their price to earnings (P/E) ratio. This measures the premium that investors are willing to pay for a firm's earnings, but the ratio becomes useless when we try it to value cloud computing stocks. This is because of the industry's obsession with growth, and its need for high margins, meaning that cloud cloud computing stocks, and particularly SaaS stocks, reinvest large portions of their revenue back into growth.\nSo much so that one of the most troubled SaaS companies these days has been aggressively investing in growth despite its shares being down 39.65% year to date. This firm ranks 6th on our list of Ray Dalio\u2019s Top 10 Growth Stock Picks with 30+% Revenue Growth, with its second quarter product revenue of $868.8 million marking a 28.9% annual growth. However, this growth clearly hasn't been enough, as the stock tumbled by 14.7% after the latest earnings report. During the same period, this firm's marketing and research and development expenses sat at $838.2 million, or 96% of its revenue. This is a classic illustration of the cloud computing industry, and one that requires different valuation metrics than the P/E ratio as these firms are not profitable most of the time.\nThe two key metrics for valuing SaaS stocks in particular are the EV/Revenue and the Rule of 40. A firm's enterprise value is its market value plus net debt, and when divided by revenue, the resulting ratio measures the premium that a buyer would be willing to pay for a firm over its ability to generate revenue. The Rule of 40 is simpler, as it simply states that the sum of a SaaS firm's revenue growth rate and profit margin should exceed 40. While this rule is simply a benchmark and not all inclusive of SaaS performance, it does have some key implications. For instance, it implies that if a firm is growing its revenue at or faster than 40%, then it can be unprofitable.\nOn the flip side, if growth slows down, to say 10%, then it must be highly profitable with margins of at least 30% to show that the lower growth is accompanied by the benefits of the beefy margins that software companies enjoy. McKinsey also substitutes the profit margin with the free cash flow (FCF) margin to further broaden this rule's scope. A firm's FCF simply eliminates the impact of interest, taxes, and capital expenditure on the net income. As per its analysis, the top Rule of 40 SaaS companies are investor favorites. This is because McKinsey's data shows that in a sample size of 100 SaaS companies, those with the 25 highest Rule of 40 scores had median EV/Revenue multiples of 22. This was nearly 22x the overall sample's 11x, and nearly 3x the bottom 25 firms' median EV/Revenue multiples of 8. In other words, investors are typically willing to pay a higher premium over sales for SaaS firms that have either robust revenue growth, superior cost control, or a mix of both.\nFinally, while EV/Revenue and Rule of 40 measure the financial validity and stature of these firms, their stock performance is also tightly linked to the economy and monetary policy. A low interest regime means that businesses can spend more money, which is beneficial for SaaS and cloud computing firms, both. On Wall Street, August has marked a paradigm shift after Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that his organization was satisfied with macroeconomic indicators to cut interest rates. This has also impacted valuations, as the median EV/Sales ratio for the top companies, i.e. Rule of 40 firms with a growth rate higher than 30%, sat at 13.3x as of the latest market close. This is the second highest for the year, with the last high being in May when it sat at 16.3x. This was before a brief rate gloom took over Wall Street in July which saw the flagship S&P index lose 8.5% between mid July and early August.\nAny discussion of SaaS stocks would be incomplete without a brief discussion of the implications of artificial intelligence. According to hedge fund Coatue Management, SaaS valuations as measured by forward sales are at a historic low right now through a median of 5.5x. This comes with lower growth expectations, as just 1% of SaaS firms are now seeing a median forward growth estimate of 30%+. As for the business model, SaaS firms are seeing a shift from a traditional seat based model that drove revenue from the number of users that were using the services to a consumption driven model. Their lower growth expectations are also somewhat driven by the belief that AI could allow companies to cost effectively create their own code and thereby reduce their reliance on SaaS and cloud computing providers.\nOur Methodology \nTo make our list of the best cloud stocks to buy according to short sellers, we ranked the holdings of First Trust's cloud ETF by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short. Then, the stocks with the lowest percentage were selected.\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the mega cap technology giant whose business is fueled by its search engine. Google's Search is the world's largest platform of its kind, and it enables the firm to monetize its traffic to allow businesses to publish advertisements directly on Search and on web properties that have chosen to work with it. Search's size, as evident by its processing of 5.9 million queries per minute provides Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with a wide competitive moat that is the industry's envy. Additionally, its tech driven focus makes it the third biggest cloud company in the world by market share. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google Cloud business allows those unwilling to invest in infrastructure to use its hardware for their AI processing. This includes Apple, whose Apple Intelligence is trained on Google Cloud through Google's tensor processing units (TPUs) and leaving NVIDIA out of the equation. However, 2024 has seen threats linger on the horizon for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), in the form of purported anti trust action by the government and AI powered search platforms.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the best cloud stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) look very promising so lets take a look.\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Alphabet is:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.30 = US$102b \u00f7 (US$415b - US$78b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nTherefore, Alphabet has an ROCE of 30%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 6.6% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n View our latest analysis for Alphabet \nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Alphabet compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Alphabet .\nWe like the trends that we're seeing from Alphabet. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 30%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 53%. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.\nIn summary, it's great to see that Alphabet can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Alphabet can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\nOn the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation for GOOGL on our platform  that is definitely worth checking out.\nAlphabet is not the only stock earning high returns.

        "Author": "  Maham Fatima ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Reddit.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other AI stocks.\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent in current world affairs, new patterns concerning its research and development strategies are also emerging.\u00a0Traditionally, academia has focused on basic research and education, while industry concentrated on applied research and commercialization. However, in recent years, the commercial sector's dominance in AI investment and research has raised concerns about the balance of power. The shift of researchers from academia to industry has also raised questions.\nAdvanced AI systems increasingly require large amounts of data, compute power, and funding resources that industry actors possess in greater quantities than academia and nonprofits. Hence, AI research, which was originally the domain of academia in the early 2000s is now being taken over by industry.\nWe recently talked about this division in another article we published, 7 Most Popular AI Penny Stocks Under $5, here's an excerpt from it:\n\u201cA recent study from Stanford University found that businesses train AI models faster than academic institutions. In 2023, the industry-trained AI neared 51 significant machine learning models, while academia managed only 15. This trend persisted in 2024 despite rising training costs. ChatGPT 4, the latest model of ChatGPT, cost about $80 million to train. Google\u2019s Gemini Ultra cost around $191 million.\u201d\nA 2021 Stanford report says that the reason behind the blurring roles of academia and industry is that businesses come with affordable cloud computing, open-source libraries, and pre-trained models that incentivize university researchers to pursue commercial applications of their work. More and more industry papers are now appearing at conferences, raising concerns about applied research stifling long-term innovation or being biased toward corporate interests, all while also accelerating solutions for real-world problems.\nA 2023 paper in the journal Science states that businesses attract 70% of the top talent with PhDs in AI today, as compared to just 20% 2 decades ago. The number of AI research faculty in academia has stagnated, while industry hiring has surged 8 times since 2006. Industry models being substantially larger (about 29 times), indicating superior computing power, is a huge reason behind this.\nIn 2021, US government agencies allocated a total of $1.5 billion for academic AI research, while Google spent the same amount on a single project in just one year.\nThe largest AI models are now developed in industry 96% of the time. Leading benchmarks are also primarily industry-driven, accounting for 91% of the total. Furthermore, the number of published papers with industry co-authors has nearly doubled since 2000.\nYet, there's another anticipated shift as academic researchers are increasingly able to deploy their inventions in real-world settings. Duolingo, a language learning app developed by academics, is a successful example.\nA distinguished MIT professor, Fr\u00e9do Durand, believes academia can still be a driving force for innovation. He says that 25 years ago, the field of computer graphics in academia faced a similar resource imbalance where the industry created stunning visuals that academia couldn't match. However, instead of trying to mimic industry, academia took a different path and focused on ideas like advanced lighting simulations, fluid dynamics, and machine learning for animation. These seemingly outlandish ideas eventually became the foundation of modern rendering and graphics hardware.\nDurand believes this approach holds valuable lessons for AI research. He emphasizes the importance of academia pursuing unconventional approaches, openly sharing their work, and maintaining a sense of excitement about the field.\nHowever, he recognizes the challenges for academia and suggests potential solutions including increased government funding for academic research, shared research infrastructure, and strategies to keep top AI talent within academia. While industry seems to be taking over AI in general, collaborative partnerships with academia could yield better results. In one way or the other, AI will remain a hot topic in the coming times.\nMethodology\nTo compile our list, we sifted through several active subreddits to compile a list of 15 AI stocks to buy. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

It operates through three main segments, Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets.\nIt dominates the online search and advertising sector, fueled by its expertise in algorithms and AI, and has a 90% market share in search and over 2 billion users for its advertising products.\nThe company's Pixel 9 phones, which have an on-device AI assistant Gemini Nano, are a highlight, but the US Justice Department's potential breakup has pressured the company's shares. 216 hedge funds were long in the company by the second quarter of 2024. Fisher Asset Management\u00a0is the top shareholder in the company and has a position worth $8.856 billion.\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024. During the second quarter, Cloud revenue alone rose 28.8%. The overall revenue growth was 13.59%, with a revenue of $84.74 billion. Google now has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels.\nThe company's shares slipped recently following reports that OpenAI is working on a web search product called SearchGPT.

        "Title": "Is ChatGPT Taking Market Share From Google Search? Alphabet Could Have a Problem It Hasn't Had to Worry About for Years",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has built its business around two high-prized assets over the years: YouTube and Google Search. The latter, however, is facing some significant headwinds right now. Regulators have been taking a hard look at its dominance and recently found that it acted as a monopoly.\nAnd with a rise in artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, there may be less of a reason for people to rely on search engines at all. While the transition may not be instantaneous, there could already be a sign that Alphabet's business may be in trouble.\nAccording to a recent survey conducted by investment banking firm Evercore that involved 1,300 Americans, 8% said they are using ChatGPT as their go-to search engine. That's up from just 1% a few months earlier. Google Search remains the leader with 74% of surveyed users relying on its results, but that is down from 80% in the earlier survey.\nThere's not necessarily a cause for alarm as Google firmly remains the top choice for many users. And an uptick in interest in ChatGPT may still not be a concerning trend for the business. ChatGPT has been around since November 2022, and if its share of search was around just 1% recently, that suggests it hasn't been taking a whole lot of traffic from Google despite its soaring popularity.\nWhile the recent increase in people opting to use the chatbot rather than Google Search is not a good sign for Alphabet, it may not necessarily be indicative of a problematic and long-term trend -- at least not yet.\nBut the risk, however, is real. Chatbots like ChatGPT can potentially divert traffic away from Google Search. If people can get answers through a chatbot, Google's search engine may not be nearly as valuable as it once was. That can be a problem for marketers who buy ads on Google Search, as it can mean they're getting less value for their ad spend. That, in turn, can lead to less demand and slowing growth for Google in the future.\nWhether it's ChatGPT or another chatbot, the danger for Google is that it may finally have some real competition to worry about now. Its position in search has been so strong that a U.S. judge ruled last month that the company had a monopoly on it. According to data from statcounter, Google accounts for 90% of the search engine market share, and Microsoft's Bing comes in at a very distant second place with just a 4% share of global searches.\nMoving forward, however, as chatbots become more prominent, the playing field could intensify. While Alphabet has its own chatbot, Gemini, it will have to compete with several chatbots, including not just ChatGPT but Microsoft's Copilot, Meta AI (from Meta Platforms), and others.\nIt may be tougher than ever for Alphabet to still dominate on search not only due to the possible consequences from the recent antitrust case, but also given the role that AI chatbots may play in the future; there's no reason to expect that Gemini will dominate as a chatbot the way Google has dominated as a search engine in the past.\nIf Google's search dominance is in doubt, that could drastically impact Alphabet's long-run growth prospects because of how dependent it is on searches. Revenue from Google Search and related properties totaled more than $48.5 billion in Alphabet's most recent quarter (which ended on June 30), accounting for 57% of its top line. If there's a noticeable decline in that figure, that could spell trouble for the tech stock.\nAlphabet looks like a cheap stock to buy -- it trades at just 22 times its trailing earnings. But if its earnings decline in the future because it's no longer able to dominate in search queries, that multiple could quickly become a lot higher. Plus, with the economy potentially entering a recession in the near future, spending on ads could also start to slow down.\nMeanwhile, its antitrust problems aren't over by any means. Investors have yet to learn what the fallout will be from the ruling related to its monopoly on search, and a new trial has begun this month to look at whether Google's advertising technology also gave it an unfair advantage.\nAlthough it may seem like a bargain buy, Alphabet's stock is trading at a discount for good reason -- there's a fair amount of risk with the business in both the short term and the long run. Unless you're a contrarian investor and have at least a moderate risk tolerance, you may be better off pursuing other growth stocks instead.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

The stock's outperformance in this regard has delighted investors - the chipmaker is doing business with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta - but it has invited the ire of the Justice Department. The department is speculated to be in the process of sending a subpoena to the company, binding the business to provide certain information, in relation to an antitrust case. The purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli firm specializing in GPU orchestration software, back in April is believed to be one of the bones of contention between the AI chipmaker and the government.\nMacro developments are also weighing on the AI stocks in the near term. Commodity markets around the world are absorbing less than impressive growth numbers from China, impacting prices of copper and rare earths. Copper and rare earth metals are extensively used in AI devices, from chips to batteries. Lates US manufacturing data also paints a not so good picture for factories. According to authorities, US manufacturing witnessed a further decline in new orders and rise in inventory during August, even as manufacturing overall contracted at a modest pace.

As the company prepares to defend ad business practices at an antitrust trial, Wall Street analysts continue to be cautiously optimistic on the shares. Morgan Stanley recently lowered the price target on the stock to $190 from $205 and kept an Overweight rating, noting that the tech giant maintains its monopoly in two product markets - general search services and general search text advertising - through its exclusive distribution agreements. Per the advisory the three primary issues the DOJ and judge are focused on solving through remedies include competitive intensity, data scale advantages and anti-competitive pricing.\nIn the investor note, Morgan Stanley analysts detailed that they had examined four reasonable outcomes from the trial against Alphabet Inc.

Quote\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple\u2019s stringent privacy standards.\nApple Intelligence will be first available in U.S. English and will be expanded quickly to include localized English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the U.K. in December. Additional language support \u2013 Chinese, French, Japanese and Spanish will be available next year.\nSiri, powered by Apple Intelligence, becomes more natural, contextually aware and capable of handling complex tasks. Users can communicate with Siri using both voice and text, and the assistant can now maintain context across multiple requests.\nThe new writing tool helps users rewrite, proofread, and summarize text everywhere, including mail, notes, pages and third-party apps.\nPhoto features get enhancement as the Movie feature now allows users to create the movies they want to see by simply typing a description. The new Clean Up tool identifies and removes distracting objects in the background of a photo without altering the subject.\nApple has integrated ChatGPT into its platforms, allowing users to access its expertise directly within iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\nAlthough Apple\u2019s business primarily runs around its flagship iPhone, the Services portfolio has emerged its strong growth driver. In the fiscal third quarter, Services revenues grew 14.1% year over year to $24.21 billion and accounted for 28.2% of sales.\nApple expects the September-end quarter\u2019s (fourth-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow at the same rate as the June-end quarter on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate, similar to the first three quarters of fiscal 2024.\nThe AAPL stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of D suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\nApple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 29.43X compared with the sector\u2019s 24.76X and higher than the median of 27.68X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\nApple shares have returned 23.1% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s appreciation of 23.9%.\nApple\u2019s AI push is attractive for growth-oriented investors. The Services business has emerged as AAPL\u2019s new cash cow with an expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade. An expanding user base of more than 2 billion active devices makes Apple\u2019s investment profile attractive.\nHowever, Apple\u2019s sluggish China business has been a headache. Greater China sales decreased 6.5% year over year to $14.73 billion, accounting for 17.2% of total sales in the fiscal third quarter.\nApple currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Apple Inc. AAPL and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nNVIDIA Corp. crushed bubble fears this year and its shares surged more than 100%. However, NVIDIA's stock price recently faced bouts of volatility after tech behemoths trimmed spending on artificial intelligence (AI) and the company's latest quarterly results failed to meet high expectations.\nBut it's also true that NVIDIA's newest stock buyback plan is expected to please income-oriented investors. So, is this the right time to buy the NVIDIA stock? Let's have a look \u2013\nNVIDIA hasn't tampered with its quarterly dividends, but it recently authorized a fresh $50 billion share repurchase. However, stock buybacks aren't new for NVIDIA. The company approved a $25 billion share repurchase in August 2023 and bought back stocks worth around $15.4 billion in the first half of its fiscal 2025.\nNVIDIA's board of directors can afford to repurchase shares as the company has generated significant cash flows. NVIDIA's new stock buyback plan is currently the third largest on the S&P 500. Apple Inc. has repurchased shares worth around $91 billion over the past year, while Alphabet Inc. has repurchased some $63 billion in shares, per FactSet.\nShare repurchases, in general, are an indication of a healthy corporate organization. This is because share repurchases lead to a decrease in the number of outstanding shares and an increase in the value of the remaining shares, which is a blessing for shareholders.\nNVIDIA's new $50 billion stock buyback and the remaining $7.5 billion share repurchase authorization may be less than 2% of the company's market capitalization. However, this shows that management is optimistic about NVIDIA's future business prospects.\nDo share prices go up after a stock buyback? The reduction in the number of outstanding shares often leads to an uptick in share prices. So, it's expected that NVIDIA's shares should increase in the long run.\nIt's prudent for investors to ignore NVIDIA's $279 billion market capitalization rout on Tuesday since its shares are not down on isolation. The broader tech sector fell due to discouraging economic data. In reality, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average (DMA) year to date, signifying a long-term uptrend.\nBeing the worldwide leader in graphic processing units (GPUs) bodes well for NVIDIA. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, recently said that $1 trillion worth of data centers would migrate from central processing units (CPUs) to GPUs.\nNotably, the global GPU market size is projected to jump from $75.77 billion in 2024 to $1,414.39 billion by 2034 at a CAGR of 13.8%, according to Precedence Research.\nNVIDIA's strong positioning in the AI field should help its shares scale upward. MarketsandMarkets stated that the AI industry is estimated to expand from $214.6 billion in the current year to $1,339.1 billion by 2030.\nLaunch of the cutting-edge Blackwell AI chips later this year would eventually squash any skepticism about NVIDIA. This is because Blackwell is more than just a GPU, its infrastructure platform can offer more AI throughput than the current Hopper platform.\nNVIDIA's initiatives to enter the ever-growing gaming and industrial metaverse space are also a tailwind for the company. Hence, the $2.76 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA's earnings per share is up 73.6% from a year ago (read more: The Best Chip Stock Post NVIDIA Earnings: NVDA, AMD, or INTC?).\nFundamentally, NVIDIA has been able to generate profits more proficiently. After all, NVIDIA stock's return on equity (ROE) is nearly 120%, while the Semiconductor-General industry's is 73.2%. An ROE above 100% shows that the company's net income is greater than its equity or that the company's performance is very strong.\nDespite the positives, buying NVIDIA's shares may burn a hole in your wallet. The voracious demand for AI models and supremacy in the GPU market has made the NVIDIA stock pricey.\nThis is because, per the price/earnings ratio, NVIDIA stock currently trades at 43.2X forward earnings. However, NVIDIA's rivals or the peer group's forward earnings multiple is 18.2X.\nThus, investors should wait for the right entry point and buy on the dip. Those who have invested in NVIDIA should hang on to it since the stock is for the future, as AI is the next big thing in the technology space (read more: 2 AI Stocks That Can Be the Next NVIDIA).\nNVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN.\nWall Street darling NVIDIA Corp. saw its market capitalization climb to $2.61 trillion from $358 billion two years ago with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). However, NVIDIA stock\u2019s unparalleled surge this year hit a speed bump lately due to the violation of antitrust laws, and AI bubble qualms.\nMeanwhile, CEO Jensen Huang has sold NVIDIA\u2019s shares, which makes us wonder whether the chipmaker has the potential to increase shareholder wealth. Let\u2019s have a look \u2013\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission filings revealed last week that Huang off-loaded more than $633 million of the chipmaker\u2019s stock since June. Huang has sold shares in tranches of 120,000 each from June 13 to Sept. 5, which accounts for almost 5.3 million shares.\nOn Friday, NVIDIA\u2019s shares posted their worst two-week stretch in two years, while the world\u2019s most sought-after AI player was subjected to wild price swings over the past month that dwarfed even the most volatile assets like cryptocurrency.\nGeopolitical tensions to legal issues plagued NVIDIA, with the stock witnessing a $279 billion wipeout in a single trading session last week. The U.S. Department of Justice subpoenaed NVIDIA in a mounting antitrust issue.\nDoes this sound depressing? Fear not; the NVIDIA stock has an upside potential, and remaining bullish would reap benefits in the long run. Here are the positive reasons \u2013\nInvestors are waiting for the rollout of the cutting-edge new Blackwell chips. However, engineering snags have delayed the process. NVIDIA has been addressing the design flaws in the Blackwell B200 chip and aims to launch it by the year-end. So, the delay period is not long enough to impact the NVIDIA stock\u2019s 2025 results.\nMicrosoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms, Inc. have already ordered Blackwell chips worth billions of dollars, and Amazon.com, Inc. is expected to move from Hopper to Blackwell.\nNVIDIA confirmed that the demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply and may continue into the next fiscal year. After all, the Blackwell platform has more AI throughput than the current Hopper platform. The new Blackwell graphic processing unit (GPU) has greater processing power, which is the most pressing need. It holds 208 billion transistors, way more than the 80 billion in the present H100 CHIP. Also, Blackwell\u2019s NVLink offers high-speed communication, which is the need of the hour.\nThus, strong demand for the Blackwell chip is expected to boost the NVIDIA stock following its launch. Lest we forget, NVIDIA\u2019s shares surged by double digits in the three months following the launch of two previous architectures \u2014 Hopper in the fall of 2022 and Ampere in the spring of 2020.\nIn the dot-com bubble, companies\u2019 shares scaled upward based on hype before the real impact of their business models could be felt. However, AI has become an integral part of all businesses. According to Markets and Markets, the AI industry is poised to expand from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion in 2030.\nNVIDIA is well-poised to make the most of the flourishing AI industry since its chips are essential for AI models deployed across several verticals, including cloud computing. This explains why the company\u2019s H100 graphic cards have huge demand in the AI chip market. Moreover, unlike the stocks in the Internet bubble, NVIDIA has solid fundamentals that validate the company\u2019s stretched valuations, and squash bubble fears.\nNVIDIA has generated profits competently since its return on equity (ROE) is almost 120%, which is way higher than the Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s 73.2%. Notably, any ROE above 100% shows that the company\u2019s net income is more than its equity, or the performance is strong.\nNVIDIA\u2019s net profit margin is 55%, above the industry\u2019s 47.6%. Any net margin of 20% indicates the company can curtail costs and generate profits.\nWhat\u2019s more, NVIDIA recently approved a stock buyback worth $50 billion, indicating a healthy corporate organization. Share repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares and increase the value of the remaining shares, which bodes well for shareholders.\nBeing the worldwide leader in GPUs, NVIDIA\u2019s stock will benefit. Huge data is expected to migrate from central processing units to GPUs, per Huang. According to Precedence Research, the GPU market will expand from $56.55 billion in 2023 to $1,414.39 billion by 2034.\nNVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with Siemens to enter the metaverse space and the introduction of GeForce in the growing gaming market will act as a tailwind for the company. As a result, the $2.80 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s earnings per share is up 76.1% yearly.\nBanking on the highly anticipated launch of the groundbreaking Blackwell chips, inherent capability to crush bubble concerns, the introduction of stock buyback plans, and a dominant player in the semiconductor space gives NVIDIA\u2019s shares the fuel to scale northward despite the current hiccups.\nProminent brokers, thus, have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 40.2% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $106.47. The analysts\u2019 highest price target is $200, indicating an upside of 87.9%.\nMoreover, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average year to date, a tell-tale long-term uptrend. This is why investors should hang on to this multi-bagger stock and not let it go.\nNVIDIA stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Large Cap Stocks Jim Cramer Can\u2019t Stop Talking About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other large cap stocks Jim Cramer can\u2019t stop talking about.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer highlights a critical gap in the American education system, which often overlooks financial literacy despite its importance. While students may graduate with extensive knowledge in subjects like chemistry, history, and languages, they rarely receive practical education on managing personal finances. Cramer emphasizes that financial planning, retirement readiness, and investing are seldom covered, leaving many people uninformed about crucial money management skills.\n\u201cThere is a gaping hole in the American education system, although I hesitate even to call it a system. When you go to high school, they teach you chemistry, geometry, and physics. You have English classes, history classes, and foreign language classes. You can graduate from college speaking three languages with a deep understanding of quantum physics or ancient philosophy. But you know the one thing they almost never teach you in middle school or high school, let alone college? Financial literacy.\nCramer\u2019s mission is to bridge this gap through the CNBC Investing Club, where he and the Charitable Trust provide practical financial guidance. He stresses the significance of retirement planning, noting that while 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are key tools for saving, many people lack comprehensive understanding of their benefits and limitations.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m on a constant mission to teach you how to manage your money, which is what we do every day in the CNBC Investing Club, with the Charitable Trust providing a constant source of examples. When it comes to managing your money, nothing is more important than retirement. Sooner or later, you\u2019re going to stop working\u2014hopefully sooner rather than later, unless you really love your job. I\u2019m betting most of you, even if you don\u2019t own individual stocks, still have some money in a 401(k) plan.\nCramer points out that while contributing to a 401(k) is widely advised, it\u2019s not always the best strategy for everyone. Despite its tax advantages and the ability to defer taxes on contributions, 401(k) plans can have drawbacks, such as hidden fees that diminish returns.\n\u201cHear me out, darn it\u2014you need to know this stuff. Your future self will thank you for getting your retirement funds in order. While you may think you know everything you need to know about these tax-favored accounts, the truth is there\u2019s a lot the so-called experts don\u2019t tell you or don\u2019t want you to know. For example, conventional wisdom says that you absolutely must invest in your 401(k)\u2014you\u2019d have to be a fool not to contribute.\nHe argues that understanding both the benefits and the shortcomings of these retirement accounts is essential for making informed financial decisions. Cramer encourages individuals to educate themselves about these investment options to ensure their retirement savings are managed effectively.\n\u201cHowever, sometimes I think it can be the wrong approach. I\u2019m not going to sing the praises of the noble 401(k) plan or tell you it\u2019s the key to your financial salvation because 401(k) plans can be a real mixed bag. Sure, they have a couple of really great features, but they also have a lot of bad ones, and those problematic features will eat away at your returns\u2014sometimes through fees that are almost totally hidden from you. I do not like that. So let me lay out the good, the bad, and the ugly of 401(k) plans. Then I\u2019ll tell you whether it makes sense for you to contribute more money to your own 401(k)\u2014maybe there\u2019s a better way for you to invest for retirement.\u201d\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nMarket Capitalization: 1.94T\nJim Cramer notes that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s recent concerns about not making acquisitions are driven by the fear of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) potentially surpassing them. According to Cramer, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s hesitation is rooted in a specific worry: that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) could catch up and overtake Google in the competitive landscape.\n\u201cGoogle isn\u2019t buying because they\u2019re worried that the other guys might do something. They\u2019re specifically worried that Meta is going to catch and pass them and they should be.\u201d\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s latest earnings report reveals a strong financial performance, with revenue reaching $84.7 billion, a 14% increase from the previous year. This growth was fueled by exceptional results in its key areas, such as Search and Cloud. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s operating income surged to $27.4 billion, while net income climbed to $23.6 billion, showcasing significant improvement. The Search business was particularly successful, contributing $73.9 billion in revenue, and YouTube advertising grew by 13% to $8.66 billion.\nAdditionally, the Cloud segment performed remarkably well, with revenue increasing by 28.8% to $10.35 billion and achieving over $1 billion in quarterly operating profit for the first time. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s commitment to investing in artificial intelligence (AI) enhances its growth prospects. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s focus on advancing AI within its Search and Cloud services is expected to yield substantial returns as AI becomes more widely adopted across various sectors. While there are some challenges in its Network ads segment, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s strong performance in Search, Cloud, and AI positions it well for ongoing growth and profitability.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor\u00a0letter:\n\u201cWe also added to\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI.\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th\u00a0on our list of the large cap stocks Jim Cramer can\u2019t stop talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 23, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Salesforce, Inc. CRM, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s AMD.\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nNVIDIA Corp.has crushed bubble fears and has seen a meteoric rise in the past few years amid the advent of artificial intelligence (AI).\nCEO Jensen Huang, however, believes NVIDIA's growth story is just beginning, while the Federal Reserve's recent jumbo interest rate cuts should help the company access cheaper capital. So, is this the most opportune moment to place bets on the stock? Let's take a closer look.\nIn Wednesday's concluded policy meeting, the Fed trimmed interest rates by half a point to support economic growth and stabilize the labor market. For the first time in four years, the Fed eased its monetary policy and kept the interest rates at 4.75% to 5%.\nThe Summary of Economic Projections further showed that most Fed officials expect another 50-basis point rate cut by the end of the year, followed by 100 and 50-basis point rate cuts in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\nA lower interest rate environment bodes well for NVIDIA since the semiconductor behemoth's cash flows essential for growth initiatives aren't affected. At the same time the company's cost of borrowings gets reduced, eventually boosting the profit margins vis-\u00e0-vis the share price (read more: NVIDIA & 2 Other AI Stocks to Gain From Lower Interest Rates).\nNVIDIA stock has always performed well after interest rate cut announcements. As a result, the company's share price increased nearly 4% on Thursday.\nAccording to Dow Jones Market Data, the NVIDIA stock gained, on average, 6.9%, 16.6%, 16.7%, and 20.7% in the month, three months, six months and 12 months following a rate cut.\nOn the other hand, going back to the 1990s, the S&P 500 Index, on average, gained only 2.9% in the 12 months after a rate cut, indicating NVIDIA stock has more upside than most of the listed stocks in the broader index.\nIt's not just the long-awaited big Fed rate cut that pushed the NVIDIA stock higher yesterday. CEO Jensen Huang's encouraging comments on the AI movement at the Dreamforce technological gathering hosted by Salesforce, Inc. also had investors pouring into NVDA stock.\nHuang said the AI industry is transforming from tools to an industry of skills, and there is a huge opportunity in the field of AI that NVIDIA can exploit. This has given investors all the more reason to believe that NVIDIA's stunning growth isn't over yet. Even though NVIDIA stock has fallen off its record highs, its shares have outpaced the Semiconductor - General industry this year (+138.1% vs +89%).\nNVIDIA's advanced chips are needed to train large language models like ChatGPT and Gemini and function AI interfaces. NVIDIA stock, thus, is expected to gain as the AI industry is projected to grow from around $184 billion this year to $826 billion by 2030, according to Statista.\nMoreover, AI is here to stay as its foundation is based on practical applications, unlike the dot com era when companies were involved in speculative businesses (read more: What AI Bubble? NVIDIA & 2 Other Chip Stocks With Strong Price Upside).\nEncouraging developments on Blackwell chip production, dominance in the graphic processing units (GPU) market and capability to generate profits consistently also act as tailwinds for the NVIDIA stock.\nHuang confirmed that NVIDIA has ramped up the production of cutting-edge Blackwell chips as demand has soared among the likes of Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp.. After all, the Blackwell B200 chip has more AI throughput than the current Hopper H100 chip.\nMeanwhile, NVIDIA accounts for the bulk of the share in the GPU market as more developers depend on the CUDA software platform, unlike Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s not-so-efficient ROCm software platform. NVIDIA, thus, is well-poised to make the most of the rise in the GPU market, which is likely to expand to $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion this year, per Precedence Research.\nFundamentally, the NVIDIA stock is sound. This is because its return on equity (ROE) is around 120% compared with the industry's 73.2%. An ROE above 100% indicates that the company's net income is more than the equity or that it has given a strong performance.\nGiven the positives, things are looking brighter for the NVIDIA stock. Prominent brokers have increased NVDA's average short-term price target by 31.3% from the stock's last closing price of $113.37. The highest price target is $200, an upside of 76.4%.\nHowever, the NVDA stock is still pricey. Per the price/earnings, the NVDA stock, presently, trades at 42.0X forward earnings. However, NVDA's rivals or the peer group's forward earnings multiple is 16.4X.\nTherefore, investors should wait for the right entry point to buy the stock so it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. Those who have invested in NVIDIA should stick to it since the stock has a strong upside. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Unlocking Intrinsic Value: Analysis of Alphabet Inc",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.\nAs of 2024-09-30, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $242.28. It's currently trading at a price of $163.95. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 32.33%. The company is significantly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$7.04\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.78%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 21.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n128.67\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n145.15\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n242.28\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $163.10. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -0.52%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Should You Buy This ESG Stock Now?",
        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other ESG stocks.\nDefining ESG can sometimes be straightforward: it\u2019s a finance and investing approach centered on managing risks related to environmental factors, social issues, and corporate governance. Although the concept emerged about two decades ago through a collaboration between United Nations officials and the finance industry, who argued that addressing ESG risks like climate change, labor disputes, and poor corporate governance can safeguard investments, it wasn\u2019t until the late 2010s and into the 2020s that ESG evolved into a more proactive movement, rather than a reactive one.\nA report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, with the global average near-surface temperature reaching 1.45\u00b0C\u2014closer than ever to the 1.5\u00b0C lower limit set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. Another report from the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also reveals that climate-driven disasters are already surpassing scientists\u2019 initial predictions. This urgency has sparked increased interest in niche yet rapidly expanding sectors of ESG investing, such as climate-transition funds and catastrophe bonds. In 2024, global investment in clean energy is expected to hit a significant milestone, doubling the amount allocated to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) 2024 World Energy Investment report forecasts that total global energy investment will surpass $3 trillion this year, with $2 trillion directed toward clean technologies like renewables, electric vehicles, and nuclear power. Furthermore, Bloomberg reports that global investment in the energy transition surged by 17% last year, reaching a record $1.8 trillion, with this growth trend continuing. Former VettaFi financial futurist Dave Nadig said:\n\u201cIf you solely look at climate as your window, you\u2019ll probably not end up not owning a lot of energy companies, not owning a lot of miners [and] not owning a lot of steel companies. So, you end up with something that looks like services, healthcare, and technology, which is a very strong bet to take.\u201d\nThat said, U.S. funds with ESG goals seem to be losing popularity as of late. Despite the broader stock market\u2019s gains, assets in the sector have dropped to around $335 billion, down from a peak near $365 billion at the end of 2021. Political criticism of ESG in the country has also has led some investors to reconsider their strategies within the sector. Moreover, ESG stocks are also grappling with other significant challenges, such as a key climate regulation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that is currently under legal dispute, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s resistance to including environmental risks in global financial regulations.\nHowever, despite criticism labeling the ESG sector as \u201cwoke\u201d investing, many U.S. firms remain dedicated to ESG initiatives. Investor interest also remains somewhat robust, as these funds continue to attract attention for considering both financial performance and environmental, social, and governance factors. While there have been big outflows from the sector, many institutional investors are approaching climate risks and opportunities in their portfolios with a heightened sense of urgency, with an August analysis published in the Harvard Business Review showing that nearly three-quarters of the corporate climate commitments announced in 2021 had been fully or partially achieved. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are among the top global underwriters of green bonds this year, while Bank of America, alongside other prominent investment banking firms, recently sponsored ESG-focused conferences in New York and Chicago.\nWith that in mind, ESG funds saw strong performance in the first half of the year, largely driven by their substantial investments in technology stocks. Most ESG funds that aren\u2019t focused on renewable energy tend to allocate more to tech stocks while maintaining a lower exposure to oil and gas stocks. In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 rose by approximately 15%, and nearly 60% of this gain was driven by the majority of the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019, which are often among the largest holdings in ESG funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo create the list of top ESG stocks to buy now, we chose companies from the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF and ranked them by their percentage weight in the fund, listed in ascending order. In addition, we used hedge fund sentiments regarding each stock to illustrate how well these stocks hold up in the eyes of hedge fund investors. These were taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 2024 database.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nPercentage of holdings in the fund: 2.06%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, has introduced the Google Renewable Energy Addendum, a new initiative asking its largest hardware manufacturing suppliers to commit to matching 100% of their energy use with renewable sources by 2029. This program is part of Google\u2019s broader effort to reduce its carbon footprint. The company has set ambitious environmental goals for 2030, including achieving net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain, and reducing its combined Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 50% from 2019 levels. To achieve this, Google plans to invest in both nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to offset any remaining emissions.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) delivered strong Q2 2024 results, with revenue increasing 15% year-over-year and diluted EPS rising 31%. The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) saw nearly 29% year-over-year growth, strengthening its position in the cloud market. Analysts have set a price target of $203.74, indicating a potential upside of 25.03% as of August 20.\nAdditionally, a recent UBS report highlights Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as a key player across all three layers of the AI value chain: enabling, intelligence, and application. The company\u2019s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform position it as an AI enabler, while its Gemini project strengthens its role in the intelligence layer. These factors suggest the company could significantly benefit from the projected $1.2 trillion AI market opportunity by 2027.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 6th on our list of the best ESG stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Fahad Saleem ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner.\u00a0Since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 7th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBrad Gerstner, the founder of\u00a0Altimeter Capital, has been a major believer in AI and tech stocks in general. Recently, the 53-year-old hedge fund manager shared some interesting data points highlighting the importance of tech stocks during an interview with Scott Galloway\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\u201cSince 2014 technology earnings have compounded at 16% and technology stocks have compounded at 18%. Non-tech earnings have compounded at about 4% and stocks at about 6%. So if you look at the long run of technology since 2005 it\u2019s gone from 5% of global GDP to 15% of global GDP,\u201d Gerstner said.\nGerstner, whose firm manages about $10 billion in assets, emphasized during the interview that the risk of not investing in AI is higher than the risk of investing. He was addressing the market concerns about ROI on AI spending.\n\u201cAs a professional investor, we\u2019re just trying to determine what level of asymmetry what level of enthusiasm or exuberance is baked into these stocks and what are we seeing day to day in terms of usage and revenues out of the consumer,\u201d he said.\nFor this article we scanned Altimeter Capital\u2019s Q2 portfolio and discussed its biggest AI stock picks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nBrad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital\nBrad Gerstner\u2019s Stake: $122,865,640\nWhen ChatGPT started making waves, Brad Gerstner became one of the top voices calling the AI revolution a threat to Google\u2019s search business. However, he has grown bullish on the company over the past few months. Talking about this change during a program on CNBC, the investor said he still believes the future of search is not \u201cten blue links\u201d but praised the company\u2019s efforts to change.\n\u201cThey have got to tighten the belts and get ready for this battle because this is a different battle than the one they\u2019ve been fighting for the last decade. They were dominant in ten blue links. They are not dominant in this. There are a lot of other players in the age of AI,\u201d he said.\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels. \u00a0With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. According to StatCounter report, Bing search engine\u2019s market share only increased from 3.03% in August 2023 to 3.91% in August 2024. This shows MSFT has not been able to make any notable dent in Google\u2019s market share.\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet\u2019s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts\u2019 forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) \u00a0is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe also added to\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI. During the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 7th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Favorite AI Stocks of Brad Gerstner. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MA.\nAs of 2024-09-16, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $242.28. It's currently trading at a price of $157.46. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 35.01%. The company is significantly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$7.04\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.65%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 21.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n128.67\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n145.15\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n242.28\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $163.10. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 3.46%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 17, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Walmart WMT, Procter & Gamble PG and Coca-Cola KO, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META, Oracle\u2019s ORCL and Nvidia\u2019s NVDA.\nIn recent months, we've witnessed a significant rotation in the stock market, with investors gravitating toward defensive, value-oriented stocks as they brace for an economic slowdown and potential shifts in interest rate policy.\nThis flight to safety has caused many value stocks\u2014traditionally considered stable but slow-growing\u2014to become highly sought after, driving their valuations higher. At the same time, tech stocks, known for their growth potential, have seen their prices drop, creating an unusual dynamic where some of the market\u2019s most innovative companies are now trading at lower relative valuations.\nThis presents a unique opportunity for investors. While value stocks like Walmart, Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola have been bid up due to their perceived safety, tech giants like Alphabet and Meta Platforms are now priced very attractively. Despite their lower valuations, these tech companies still have superior growth prospects, making this a rare moment where investors can acquire high-growth stocks at a discount, while more defensive stocks have become relatively expensive.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore how this market dynamic has unfolded and why tech\u2019s current pricing could be an opportunity you don\u2019t want to miss.\nIf you have been following my recent write-ups you will know that I have been talking about this rotation for some time now. Below we can see that defensive ETFs such as Value, Healthcare and Utilities have held up better than Tech and the broad market over the last few months.\nWhile it has been a good ride for those that were early in the trend, I am not sure this theme will continue much longer. In the chart above, we can see how stark the comparative valuations are now, with the tech stocks trading lower forward multiples than the value stocks.\nHowever, the narrative has begun to shift and after several months of consolidation, tech stocks appear primed for the next leg higher. In addition to the now attractive valuations, chatter and activity surrounding Artificial Intelligence is picking up again, which should lure investors back to tech. Apple just released its newest AI enabled iPhones and Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison is talking about building thousands of new data centers. Ellison also said that at a dinner recently with Elon Musk and Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang, that he and Elon were begging Jensen for more GPUs.\nWhen we compare the earnings growth projections for tech to value the disparity is striking. Over the next 3-5 years, tech stocks are expected to deliver far superior earnings growth.\nAlphabet: Analysts project GOOGL to achieve 17.5% annual EPS growth over the next few years. This growth is driven by the company\u2019s dominance in digital advertising, its strong position in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and its thriving cloud services segment through Google Cloud.\nMeta Platforms: META is forecasted to grow its earnings at an even more impressive rate of 19% annually. This growth comes from its continuing dominance in social media advertising, its shift to AI-enhanced tools for advertising and user engagement.\nWalmart: On the other hand, retail giant Walmart is expected to grow its EPS at a much more modest rate of 8.2%. While Walmart has invested heavily in e-commerce and technology to adapt to changing consumer habits, it still faces slower growth due to its mature market and tight margins in retail.\nProcter & Gamble: A defensive stock like PG, known for its household consumer products, has an EPS growth forecast of 6.6%. While PG offers steady earnings, its growth prospects are limited by its reliance on mature markets and a slower pace of innovation compared to tech.\nCoca-Cola: Finally, Coca-Cola\u2019s expected growth rate of 6.3% reflects its role as a staple in the consumer staples sector. KO\u2019s focus on beverages, while lucrative and reliable, doesn\u2019t offer the same explosive growth potential as tech companies operating in rapidly evolving industries like AI and digital media.\nGrowth forecasts clearly favor tech stocks like GOOGL and META. Their earnings are expected to compound at rates more than double that of traditional value stocks like WMT, PG, and KO. This highlights a key point: while value stocks provide stability, their limited growth potential makes them less attractive for investors seeking high returns over the long term. On top of that, tech stocks now offer better relative valuations following the recent rotation into defensive stocks, making them an even more compelling buy.\nFor example, GOOGL and META, despite their higher growth potential, currently trade at forward P/E multiples lower than their historical averages, as investors have become more cautious on tech. Meanwhile, WMT, PG, and KO, with slower growth prospects, are trading at elevated P/E ratios compared to their historical norms, as investors have flocked to these defensive names amid economic uncertainty.\nThis unusual dynamic presents a rare opportunity for investors. Buying tech stocks with high growth potential at attractive valuations can offer a combination of both growth and value. On the flip side, while value stocks provide near-term safety, they may be fully priced, with limited upside left if growth fails to materialize.\nFor investors, the key takeaway is that tech stocks are offering a better balance of growth potential and reasonable valuations, while value stocks, despite their recent popularity, may be nearing their upside potential.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.
