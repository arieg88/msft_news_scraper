Discover the potential of this market before other investors.\nThe report indicates a push to break up Google would be the first attempt to dismantle a company for monopolization since regulators unsuccessfully attempted to break up Microsoft more than two decades ago. If the DOJ moves forward with the breakup plan, the Android operating system and Google Chrome are the most likely units for divestment.\nThe DOJ is reportedly exploring less severe options as well, including forcing the company to share more data with competitors in an effort to stop Google from gaining an unfair advantage in its AI products.\nRegardless, people familiar with the matter said the government is likely to try to put an end to the type of contracts that were scrutinized in the recent case against Google.\nCheck It Out:\nReal estate is a wealth builder for the nation\u2019s 1%.

Regulators alleged Google maintained a monopoly on online search and related advertising through billions of dollars in payments to smartphone makers. Alphabet has said it will appeal that decision.\nGoogle is the most-used search engine in the world with more than $300 billion in annual revenue. A forced breakup of Alphabet would be the biggest breakup of a U.S. company since AT&T was broken up in the 1980s.\nGOOG Price Action: Alphabet shares were down 1.08% after hours at $164.14 at the time of publication, according to Benzinga Pro.\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

Wood\u2019s flagship fund ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is down about 18% so far this year and has lost about 75% of its value since hitting its peak in 2021. However, the latest data shows that the innovation-focused investor bought the dip on tech stocks after the latest selloff that shook financial markets globally.\nInvestors have pulled about $2.2 billion from ARK funds in 2024. The fund is on track to post its worst year of investor exodus since 2014. But Cathie Wood is doubling down on her innovation bets and is hopeful the upcoming rate cuts will be positive for the stock market.\nCathie Wood Says \u201cSomething Is Changing\u201d and the Fed is Now on \u201cHigh Alert\u201d\nTalking about the market situation, Cathie Wood said in a\u00a0latest video\u00a0on her YouTube channel that the recent selloff shows the market is going through a \u201ccathartic\u201d phase and \u201csomething is changing.\u201d\n\u201cI do believe that the Fed now is on high alert because the stock market seemed to be encouraging the Fed to hold tight, higher for longer, make sure that the inflation was out of the system.\u201d\nCathie Wood said that corporations are now in a weaker position amid high rates and they will initiate layoffs to cut costs and increase productivity. This weak employment situation could encourage the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates, according to Wood.\n\u201cInterest rates coming down should be very positive for the equity markets, but they will not arrest a recession very quickly. In fact, if consumers and businesses know that interest rates and maybe prices will be coming down, what will they do? They will wait.\u201d\nCathie Wood\u2019s ARK has posted its latest stock holdings data as of the end of the June quarter.

        "Title": "Better Tech Stock: Nvidia vs. Alphabet",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech stocks have been battered and beaten over the last month, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector down 13%. There's not one specific reason for the sell-off, but rather several different ones. Better-than-expected inflation reports at the start of July triggered a slight reshuffle on Wall Street, allowing investors to pull back from the reliability of tech and look into less stable investments.\nThen, midway through the month, the Biden administration proposed more stringent sanctions on chip exports to China. Combined with the start of earnings season at the end of July, many tech stocks slid in recent weeks.\nWhile a market dip can be worrying, it also presents many buying opportunities. The tech industry remains one of the best places to invest for the long term, fueled by innovative companies that never cease to push the envelope. Meanwhile, a sell-off generally means better-priced stocks.\nTwo attractive long-term options are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), with one leading the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market and the other home to a booming cloud business. Either of these companies' stocks would likely be real assets for any portfolio over the long term.\nSo, let's compare these tech giants and determine whether Nvidia or Alphabet is the better stock this year.\nNvidia's stock took a hard tumble over the last 30 days, falling 12%. The dip hasn't been great for current stockholders, but it has made the shares more accessible to new ones thanks to an improved valuation.\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is at one of its lowest levels in months, at about 62. That's high for a P/E and doesn't usually represent a bargain, but it's significantly lower than Nvidia's five-year average P/E of 80.\nThat average saw Nvidia's stock rise more than 2,500% since 2019, suggesting its current position is unlikely to stop it from delivering major gains in the coming years.\nMeanwhile, the company maintains a solid long-term outlook. Nvidia will post its 2025 second-quarter earnings on Aug. 28, an even that will likely boosting its share price. It beat Wall Street estimates for four consecutive quarters, and this quarter will likely follow suit.\nNvidia's chip rival Advanced Micro Devices reported second-quarter 2024 earnings this week. Revenue outperformed forecasts by $12 million as sales in its AI-focused data center segment surged 115% year over year. Considering Nvidia dominates the AI chip industry with an estimated 70% to 95% market share, it could be in for another quarter of beating expectations based on AMD's performance.\nA recent stock slump and an upcoming earnings release could be an excellent time to buy Nvidia before it's too late.\nAlphabet is another exciting way to invest in tech. While Nvidia dominates hardware, Alphabet has reached historic heights with the popularity of its software. Its Android, Chrome, YouTube, and Google have made the company a household name and a thoroughly reliable growth stock.\nAlphabet's shares have risen 178% over the last five years, beating the S&P 500's 82% rise. The company won over investors with consistent reinvestment in itself and financial growth.\nThe tech giant reported its second-quarter earnings last week, beating expectations in multiple areas. Earnings per share came in at $1.89 versus the $1.84 forecast. Net sales rose 14% year over year, landing $450 million above estimates. The quarter was the first time Google Cloud surpassed $10 billion in quarterly revenue and delivered over $1 billion in operating profit.\nThe company slightly missed on YouTube ad revenue, posting $8.7 billion against expectations of $8.9 billion. But sales in the segment still rose 13% year over year, rounding out an overall positive quarter for Alphabet.\nThe second quarter illustrated that Alphabet's advertising division remains a highly profitable business, alongside solid prospects in AI.\nBoth companies are among the most prominent names in tech, but Nvidia and Alphabet are otherwise challenging to compare. Their businesses operate in vastly different areas of the industry. Nvidia predominantly sells its chips to businesses, with part of its sales tied to the consumer market. Meanwhile, Alphabet's core business is digital advertising, and it is making impressive headway in cloud computing.\nHowever, these companies do complement each other. Alphabet requires graphics processing units (GPUs) like Nvidia's to run and expand its cloud services. And Nvidia's business is thriving by selling its chips to companies like Alphabet.\nAs a result, it's worth comparing their valuations to determine which is the better buy.\nAlphabet's stock is currently a far better value than Nvidia's, with a significantly lower P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. These metrics help determine a stock's value, and the lower the figure, the bigger the bargain.\nAs a result, Alphabet's stock is likely a lower-risk investment for now. With a lucrative ad business and expanding role in AI, it's worth picking up over Nvidia right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $657,306!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

While the devices are usually an afterthought for investors because of their small revenue contribution relative to Google\u2019s digital advertising business, expectations are high that new AI capabilities could demonstrate leadership in the highly competitive arena.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to get some solid information about the Google AI product to help turn around this period of profit taking,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, a senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder LLC. \u201cIt\u2019s very helpful for investors to hear news like this and generally most of the time it\u2019s positive news and helps the stock.\u201d\nA boost is much needed. Alphabet shares have fallen 15% from a high in mid-July. They\u2019ve come under pressure along with other megacaps amid concerns about slowing economic growth in the US and lofty valuations, while investors are increasingly worried that there\u2019s relatively little to show for heavy spending on AI. Alphabet shares fell after second-quarter capital spending came in higher than expected as the company strives to outmatch rivals in AI.\nOver the past year, the perception of Google\u2019s position in the race to deploy generative AI technologies has been critical to its stock performance. In February, Alphabet shares dropped more than 4% in a single day when Google paused image generation for its Gemini AI model after producing inaccurate historical depictions. In April, the stock rallied after unveiling updates to AI offerings for cloud customers.\nAt Tuesday\u2019s event, Alphabet is expected to show more on-device AI offerings, driven by native integration of its Gemini large language model for text, image and voice-level features, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cAdvantages for Google\u2019s Android in owning its foundational large language model are being highlighted by the delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence features, such as its integration with ChatGPT in version 18.1 of iOS,\u201d analyst Mandeep Singh wrote.\nAlphabet\u2019s recent selloff has left the stock hovering around the cheapest since March. It\u2019s priced at 19 times profits projected over the next 12 months, down from a high of nearly 24 times last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s at a discount to the average multiple in the S&P 500, which sits around 20.5 times. Shares in the company rose as much as 1.5% in early trading on Tuesday.\n\u201cThe stock is pretty cheap for the massive free cash flow machine they are,\u201d said Eric Clark, portfolio manager at Accuvest Global Advisors Inc. \u201cNew AI will enhance the margin profile for ads and allow better pricing as we saw with Meta.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nDonald Trump and Elon Musk held a warm, but glitch-delayed conversation on X that saw the tech mogul pitch a role for himself should the Republican nominee win a second White House term.\nMusk also had a more subtle message for Trump supporters: Stop demonizing EVs.\nWith its hardware event on Tuesday, Alphabet\u2019s Google is trying to outshine Apple\u2019s annual iPhone launch \u2014 and is letting longtime executive Rick Osterloh take center stage.\nIndia\u2019s antitrust regulator will withdraw a report that found Apple abused its dominance of the domestic market, backtracking for now from its high-profile investigation into the US company.\nHelloFresh SE shares jumped the most since 2019, paring some of the past year\u2019s huge decline, after the German meal-kit delivery company announced efforts to cut costs and preserve profits.\nPolish billionaire Rafal Brzoska won an injunction temporarily banning Meta Platforms Inc. from publishing fake ads that use images of him or his wife Omena Mensah in Poland.\nEarnings Due Tuesday\nPremarket\nSea Ltd\nTencent Music\nMadison Square Garden Sports\nHuya\nIHS Holding\n--With assistance from Mark Gurman and Subrat Patnaik.\n(Updates to add stock move in seventh paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside Worldcoin\u2019s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity\nSurgeons Cut a Giant Tumor Out of My Head.

Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) \u00a0is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\nCooper Investors Global Equities Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cUnsurprisingly the portfolio\u2019s best performers in the very short term reflect this pattern, having narrowed to those most obviously exposed to the AI story \u2013 TSMC and\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). While the portfolio has owned semiconductor companies for years it remains diversified and is underweight the group from an active risk perspective, dragging on relative performance in the last six months. The portfolio is currently positioned to take advantage of the Value Latency we see in smaller sized companies, and the performance of the quarter has been more aligned with those factors.\nWhile this positioning is painful in the short-term, we see considerable embedded value in our portfolio. We also see considerable risks and uncertainties existing in the AI theme that are not reflected in the Value Latency on offer in many stocks that have surged.\nReturning to the AI story, today the portfolio has around 10% of capital invested across TSMC and Alphabet. Meantime, Alphabet has multiple value levers to \u00a0pull across AI-augmented search, YouTube (now the \u2018must-have\u2019 streaming platform for young people) and Google Cloud.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc(NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Here's Why Alphabet Deserves a Spot in Your Portfolio",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In a market where countless stocks are trading at unreal valuations or growing at lightning speed, investors may be tempted to load up on these types of stocks. While I'm a proponent of owning some of these names, a well-balanced portfolio isn't completely levered toward growth at all costs.\nThis is why I think there is room for companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) in a portfolio. While Alphabet participates in the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, it's not its primary business. I think Alphabet deserves a spot in every investor's portfolio, as the current business model should provide market-beating returns for years to come.\nFirst, let's look at what just a few percentage points of outperformance each year looks like. Say you invest $500 per month into the S&P 500, which has historically returned around 10% annually. After 30 years, you'll have $1.1 million. That's a great run, but if you can get 12% annual returns (which I think Alphabet can do), that number rises to $1.8 million -- a 56% increase.\nThat's a huge effect just by putting in a bit of effort to identify companies that can barely beat the market.\nAlphabet is a company that has done that consistently by being the market leader in internet search through its Google search engine. Google holds greater than a 90% market share in this space, and its dominance is undisputed. This is how Google makes the bulk of its money, selling advertising space on the billions of daily searches.\nHowever, a new challenger has some investors worried. OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is launching SearchGPT, a Google competitor. This may be one of Google's strongest competitors, but it would have to be unbelievably better to unseat Google from the minds of millions of daily users. It's a long road ahead and would occur over decades, not quarters.\nAs a result, I'm confident Google will maintain its dominance for years to come, which will allow it to continue producing year after year of market-beating growth.\nBut how will it do that?\nAt the end of the day, investors care about profits, not just sales. Although sales drive profits higher, there are other ways to grow profits.\nOne primary way is share repurchases. When a company buys back its own stock, it reduces the number of shares, so each existing shareholder gets more profit per share. Alphabet has been doing this for a long time and has meaningfully reduced its share count over the past five years.\nLast year, Alphabet reduced its shares by about 3%. This gives it a near-automatic 3% earnings per share (EPS) growth rate, which means revenue growth doesn't need to be as fast.\nAlphabet has also started paying a dividend, with its annual yield hovering around 0.5%. While that's not a huge amount, it barely scratches the surface of what it can pay. Over time, this payout will increase and further reduce the required sales growth needed to drive market-beating returns.\nShould its dividend grow to a 1% yield, Alphabet maintains a 3% per year share retirement rate, and if its margins stay steady, Alphabet would only need to grow revenue at a high single-digit pace to beat the market. With Wall Street analysts forecasting 13% and 11% revenue growth for this year and next, I'd say it's well on its way to beating the market.\nWhen you consider that you can buy Alphabet's stock at around 22 times forward earnings on par with the S&P 500's earnings valuation, the stock is perfectly priced for long-term investors.\nYour portfolio doesn't have to double each year to be a successful investor. A simple two-percentage-point beat is enough to achieve extraordinary results.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "5 Reasons to Buy Alphabet Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) shares have climbed 6,290% since they had their initial public offering 20 years ago in August 2004. During that same time period, the S&P 500 generated a total return of 637%.\nNowadays, Alphabet is one of the world's most dominant businesses, carrying a market cap of $2 trillion and raking in $328 billion in sales in the past 12 months. But it still looks like a smart investment opportunity.\nHere are five reasons to buy Alphabet stock like there's no tomorrow.\nAlphabet is a leading internet enterprise that has its hands in various digital arenas. Consequently, it benefits from multiple secular trends.\nInvestors might already know that digital advertising is the company's bread and butter. It commands more than 40% of the market globally.\nThe company is thriving as the media landscape has shifted to streaming entertainment. YouTube, which Alphabet purchased for less than $1.7 billion in 2006, accounts for the most TV viewing time in the U.S., even more than Netflix.\nAs IT spending moves off-premises, businesses that offer cloud computing services gain. Google Cloud, with its third-place market position, grew revenue by 29% and posted an 11% operating margin in the second quarter. \nWith its Waymo segment, Alphabet is aiming to introduce fully autonomous driving to the masses. While a riskier and more uncertain endeavor, this is yet another potential growth vector that could propel the business.\nThere are very few companies that possess Alphabet's financial fortitude. Its financials are in pristine condition.\nThis is one of the most profitable enterprises on the face of the planet. In Q2, Alphabet reported $23.6 billion in net income, which translated to a fantastic net profit margin of 28%. Even in 2022, a difficult period for the digital ad market, the company still registered a margin of 21%.\nInvestors don't need to worry about Alphabet running into any financial issues. That's because as of June 30, it had a net cash position of $87 billion on the balance sheet.\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) boom has lifted certain companies to new heights. But investors shouldn't forget that Alphabet was already using the technology way back in 2001 in Google Search.\nThese days, virtually all of the company's various products and services have AI embedded in them in one form or another, whether it's Maps, YouTube, Gmail, or Google Cloud, to name a few examples. Alphabet has the ability to introduce new features to a user base of billions of people, a broad distribution that is a key advantage.\nAlphabet will invest at least $12 billion per quarter on capital expenditures, mostly to build further AI-related technical capacity.\nAlphabet has arguably one of the world's widest economic moats. As this is a platform company, network effects underpin its competitive position.\nGoogle Search becomes more powerful as more information and data are created, which draws more internet users that want to access it. And this engagement is valuable to advertisers.\nFurthermore, with so much content for anyone's interests, it's no surprise that YouTube has become such a popular streaming option. As more viewers spend more time on the service, content producers are incentivized to create even more.\nDespite its impressive performance, shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20.8. That represents a discount to the broader S&P 500, which makes no sense to me, as Alphabet is a far superior company than the average one out there.\nThis valuation makes Alphabet the cheapest stock of all the \"Magnificent Seven\" constituents. That's yet another reason to buy shares.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$191 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$158. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Alphabet's current trading price of US$165 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Alphabet\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n View our latest analysis for Alphabet \nGreat news for investors \u2013 Alphabet is still trading at a fairly cheap price. Our valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $254.39, but it is currently trading at US$165 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that Alphabet\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Alphabet's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 48%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? Since GOOGL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on GOOGL for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy GOOGL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\nDiving deeper into the forecasts for Alphabet mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

        "Title": "Is Alphabet on the Hunt for a Big Acquisition?",
        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a behemoth in the tech sector. The company generates tens of billions of dollars in free cash flow every year. It has some incredibly strong assets in YouTube and Google Search, and it's always looking for ways to get bigger and more diverse. And recently, the company has reportedly been in talks to buy some fairly large companies.\nCould Alphabet secure a big acquisition this year, and would that be a good move for the business and its investors?\nEarlier this year, there were rumors that Alphabet was looking to acquire HubSpot (NYSE: HUBS), a company that makes marketing software. At the time, HubSpot was worth more than $30 billion, and if it were to go through, it would have been Alphabet's largest-ever deal. Ultimately, however, that fell through.\nMore recently, Alphabet has been looking at buying another company called Wiz. It's a fairly young cybersecurity business, founded in 2020. But with some impressive growth and many Fortune 100 companies being its customers, Alphabet was reportedly looking to offer $23 billion for the business. Alas, that deal also ended up falling through. \nWith deep pockets, Alphabet is looking around for buyout targets to enhance and diversify its business. And it could be a matter of time before the company is able to pull off a major deal. But I wouldn't count on it happening this year, as even if Alphabet finds a company to buy, it may take time to obtain the necessary approvals from regulators -- assuming they OK a large deal.\nAlphabet has made some modestly sized acquisitions in recent years, including its $2.1 billion purchase of smartwatch maker Fitbit in 2021 and its $5.4 billion acquisition of cybersecurity company Mandiant in 2022. While those deals have helped diversify Alphabet's business, a much larger acquisition could have a more pronounced impact on the company's financials. Although Alphabet's quarterly growth rate has been rising by double digits, it is notably lower than its 10-year average.\nFor Alphabet to be able to justify its $2.1 trillion valuation and for the stock to continue soaring higher, it may need to find another lever to pull on so that its top line can accelerate at a faster pace, which could help attract more growth investors.\nA substantial acquisition could also help lessen the overall risk of investing in Alphabet. With chatbots answering queries in seconds and potentially driving some traffic away from Google Search, there's the risk that a core part of its business may struggle in the future. Alphabet has its own chatbot, Gemini, but there are many others it potentially has to compete with, as tech companies are launching their own versions to ensure they don't miss out on this new growth opportunity.\nThe danger is that there's a lot riding on Alphabet's search business, and that could be a problem if the company's chatbot proves to be underwhelming compared to the competition. Last quarter, which ended on June 30, the company's revenue totaled $84.7 billion, with its Google Search & Other segment accounting for $48.5 billion (57%) of the top line. An acquisition could make Alphabet much more diverse, and that could make it a safer buy amid expanding competition.\nAlphabet's stock trades at 24 times its trailing earnings, which isn't a steep multiple by tech stock standards. Although there's some uncertainty as to what will happen with Google Search in the future, and what acquisition(s) Alphabet may end up pursuing, I'd feel comfortable buying and holding the stock for the long haul, despite the risk.\nThe company is in strong financial shape, and there's a decent margin of safety with the stock, which makes it a more tenable investment to hold than other tech stocks. And with vast resources to tap into, I'm confident the company can find ways to expand into fresh areas to bolster its growth prospects.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nThe AI-led rally in the stock market is expected to ripple through other sectors and smaller tech companies, but analysts believe for now large-cap companies are still the key focus of money managers. Morgan Stanley in its August key themes report said that while small-cap stocks rebounded on rate-cut hopes, the window for their outperformance is \u201ctoo narrow.\u201d\n\u201cHistorically small cap outperformance depended primarily on economic growth acceleration. Greater risk exposure to a \u201chigher-for-longer\u201d rate environment has added inverse rate correlation to the mix. While periods of growth acceleration with lower rates are plausible (e.g. end-2023), we see this combination as relatively unlikely in the current inflation environment. The recent decline in interest rates was a tailwind to small cap stocks, but softer economic data likely limits the durability of this trade,\u201d the firm said.\nThe latest earnings season showed that ROI on the huge AI spending by major companies is small in the short term, but long-term gains seem promising. Many companies have already started seeing monetization on their AI investments.\u00a0 Goldman Sachs analysts Joseph Briggs, Kash Rangan, and Eric Sheridan said in a June report titled\u00a0GEN AI: TOO MUCH SPEND, TOO LITTLE BENEFIT?\u00a0that they remain more optimistic about AI\u2019s economic potential even if we don\u2019t see immediate benefits for now.\nHedge funds are one step ahead of average individual investors due to the sheer scale of resources and capital they have. That\u2019s why it\u2019s always interesting to see which stocks they are buying and selling. In this article we take a look at the 10 most important AI stocks which were on the radar of elite money managers based on their second-quarter filings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Chris Hohn\u2019s TCI increased its hold in the company by about 400% while billionaire Philippe Laffont reduced his stake in Alphabet by 39% to $504 million.\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares slipped recently following reports that OpenAI is working on a web search product called SearchGPT. Before that, the stock fell following earnings despite posting strong numbers. Revenue in the second quarter jumped 14% year over year driven by search and Cloud. At a forward P/E of 22, analysts believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0continues to be one of the cheapest AI stocks in the market as its valuation remains depressed amid fears caused by an overreaction.\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels. \u00a0With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market.\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares.

        "Title": "Declining Stock and Solid Fundamentals: Is The Market Wrong About Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had a rough three months with its share price down 6.3%. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Alphabet's  ROE today.\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n View our latest analysis for Alphabet \nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:\n29% = US$88b \u00f7 US$301b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.29 in profit.\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nTo begin with, Alphabet has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 7.1% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 18% net income growth seen by Alphabet over the past five years.\nWe then compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 8.0% in the same 5-year period.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for GOOGL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. \nAlphabet has a low three-year median payout ratio of 2.8%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 97% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.\nUpon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 10% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 21%, over the same period.\nOn the whole, we feel that Alphabet's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There could be signs of trouble looming ahead for the markets. While the economy is still doing relatively well and tech companies are reporting strong numbers, the danger is that in the not-too-distant future, there could be some weakness. And I'm not referring to just the possibility of a recession.\nSpending on artificial intelligence (AI) has helped many tech companies achieve considerable growth in recent quarters, and it has given their valuations a boost. But a slowdown in AI spending could also be what causes them to decline in the near future.\nAI presents a hot new growth opportunity for many tech companies, and some are spending feverishly for the sake of not being caught behind the latest trend. Some big tech CEOs have recently hinted that may indeed be the case.\nIn a recent interview with Bloomberg, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted that, \"there's a meaningful chance that a lot of the companies are overbuilding now and that you look back and you're like, oh, we maybe all spent some number of billions of dollars more than we had to.\" Meta is definitely benefiting from the excitement, integrating its own AI into its social media apps and Ray-Ban smart glasses. And through the first six months of the year, the company's revenue has grown by 25% to $75.5 billion.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai also said, during the company's July 23 conference call with analysts, that \"when we go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here.\" Alphabet has been investing heavily into AI all across its businesses, including into its Gemini chatbot as it looks to rival the success of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Alphabet, like Meta, has also been seeing an uptick in demand this year due to a stronger ad market and resilient economic conditions, Its revenue through the first six months of 2024 has totaled $165.3 billion -- a 14% increase from the same period last year.\nBut the good top-line results shouldn't make investors overlook these leaders' warnings with respect to AI spending, as they corroborate data from research company Gartner, which estimates that at least 30% of generative AI projects may end up being abandoned by the end of next year, suggesting that companies are indeed spending far too heavily on AI.\nIt has been off to the races for companies to develop AI models and their own chatbots for their websites. But as the time comes to quantify and justify whether those projects were truly worthwhile, it may result in a reduction in spending, which would be bad news for the markets.\nAnd if companies scramble to reduce their AI expenses, that could trickle over into less spending on other areas, including advertising and any tech-related expenditures. For Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and other growth stocks, that could mean a slowdown in their growth rates, even if they aren't making next-gen AI chips.\nMany investors justify paying significant multiples for AI stocks these days because of their promising growth prospects. But the risk is that those expectations may not match up to reality, at least, not in the near term, anyway. AI can disrupt some jobs and take over others, but that doesn't mean that every investment into AI will be a worthwhile one.\nInvestors shouldn't ignore these recent warnings from Zuckerberg and Pichai, as there may be a reduction in AI and tech-related spending in the months ahead, which could result in more bearish conditions for highly priced AI stocks. While that doesn't necessarily make all AI stocks bad buys today, investors should be wary of those trading at egregious earnings multiples. And with a recession possibly coming soon as well, there may be more of a reason than ever for investors to temper their expectations for tech stocks as a whole, as their returns could be limited in the near term.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

        "Title": "Should You Buy Alphabet Stock Following Its Antitrust Defeat? 3 Tech Watchers Weigh In.",
        "Author": "  Jake Lerch, Justin Pope, and Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Well, it's official: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google, has lost a landmark antitrust lawsuit in Federal court.\nOn Aug. 5, Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Alphabet has illegally stifled competition in the online search market. In his 277-page ruling, Mehta concluded, \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\"\nSo, what does this all mean for Alphabet and its stock? In this article, three Motley Fool contributors discuss Alphabet's prospects and how investors should react.\nJake Lerch: In a nutshell, there are two key takeaways from the recent antitrust ruling:\nThis ruling is a problem for Alphabet.\nHowever, it's far from catastrophic.\nFirst, let's examine why it's a problem.\nIt should come as no surprise that losing the case is a negative outcome for the company. After all, at the very least, Alphabet will have to spend more time and money appealing the ruling (which the company has already announced it will do). That process will likely drag out for several more years.\nHowever, if Alphabet's appeals fail, the company will be forced to settle the lawsuit or accept the judge's yet-to-be-revealed remedies. Neither of those options is favorable, as they could mean paying tens of billions of dollars in fines and legal settlements. In addition, the government could seek changes to Alphabet's business practices. Specifically, the government now finds itself in a powerful position to demand alterations to Google Search -- which is the company's most lucrative business segment.\nAll in all, this ruling introduces significant uncertainty to Alphabet and its stock.\nYet there are silver linings.\nFor one thing, the ruling focuses on Alphabet's practice of paying other companies to make Google Search their default search engine. Apple, for example, received over $18 billion in 2021 in exchange for making Google the default search engine across its products. Alphabet also has deals with Samsung and numerous other device makers, and Mozilla, the nonprofit project behind Firefox.\nThose agreements are now on the chopping block, which, in a strange twist of fate, may temporarily boost Alphabet's profits. Since the company won't be paying device makers like Apple to make its search engine the default, it should save billions of dollars per year. What's unclear is whether Google will lose significant search-engine market share in response, which would hurt profitability.\nIn any event, there's no reason to believe that Google's search dominance will end quickly. As noted earlier, the appeals process will likely drag out for several years. In the meantime, Alphabet will continue to rack up billions in revenue and profits. So, while this ruling highlights why Alphabet isn't a stock for every investor, I remain bullish on it.\nJustin Pope: Alphabet's loss in the antitrust lawsuit shouldn't be a shock -- Google has over 90% market share of internet search worldwide. Ultimately, the company's anticompetitive tactics, including paying Apple nearly $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on iOS devices, were its undoing.\nSo where does this go from here?\nOf course Alphabet will appeal, and the court will work to determine penalties ranging from fines to mandates. For example, the company could be forced to divest its Android business. Virtually every non-Apple smartphone -- about 70% of the world's phones -- uses Android software. Owning Android makes it easy for Alphabet to steer most of the world's smartphones to Google.\nThis can all seem scary to investors because Google, which makes money through digital ads, is Alphabet's golden goose. But note a couple of things.\nFirst, this process will take time, perhaps multiple years, to finish playing out. There's no reason to panic-sell Alphabet stock.\nSecond, Google probably deserves some benefit of the doubt. Most people who grew up with the internet have never used any search engine besides Google. After all, people don't search for things; they \"Google\" them. That's some serious brand power. Alphabet has also built an ecosystem around Google, including its popular web browser Chrome, and software like Gmail.\nThe company has aggressively pushed artificial intelligence (AI) features into Google and has massive amounts of user data from years of dominating search. Knocking Google off won't be easy, even if mandates encourage others to try.\nSo, while Alphabet's antitrust loss is noteworthy, let's pump the brakes and see how things play out. Until proven otherwise, Alphabet is one of the world's most dominant companies.\nWill Healy: Investors may not know what to make of the judgment that Alphabet's Google search engine is a monopoly. The company paid other companies like Apple and Samsung to make it the default search engine on their platforms. Although the government ruled such payments illegal, users don't pay Alphabet directly for using Google Search, leaving some wondering whether the ruling is relevant to the average consumer.\nPending the likely appeals and possible punishments, Alphabet's short-term and medium-term prospects have become less clear. This may lead shareholders to sell, or at least not add shares. However, such news may actually be an argument for buying shares slowly; here's why.\nFirst, Google is widely perceived as the best search engine. Hence, even if it can no longer pay companies to be the default search engine, investors shouldn't assume that it will lose all or even most of its market share. That share currently stands at 91%, according to StatCounter.\nSecondly, Alphabet has slowly moved away from relying on revenue from advertising, most of which is driven by Google Search. Advertising has fallen from 87% of revenue in 2017 to 78% in 2023. So, while the judgment could speed the transition away from advertising, relying less on search was the company's plan anyway.\nFinally, Alphabet's efforts to move outside of search are technically advanced and well-funded. The company has utilized artificial intelligence in some form since 2001. And Google Cloud, its largest non-advertising segment, is the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure provider:\nImage source: Statista.\nAdditionally, Alphabet holds $101 billion in liquidity. This means it can spend, and likely has spent, heavily on building these alternative businesses.\nIndeed, the hardest part for shareholders is waiting through the appeal, to see how any punishment could affect the company should Alphabet lose again. However, between the continued popularity of Google Search and a well-funded move away from its ad business, investors should probably consider adding shares on any significant pullback.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe AI industry has been experiencing explosive growth, making it a highly attractive sector for potential investors. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the global generative AI market was valued at approximately $40 billion in 2022, just before the launch of ChatGPT, and is now expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of more than 40% to reach over $1.3 trillion in size within the next decade. This growth is fueled by the rapid adoption of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing, where AI is being leveraged to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and create new revenue streams. For instance, in healthcare, AI-driven diagnostics and personalized medicine are revolutionizing patient care, leading to more accurate and timely treatments. The finance sector is also reaping the benefits of AI through advanced algorithms for fraud detection, risk management, and personalized banking services.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThe AI market is not just expanding in terms of applications but also geographically. North America has been a dominant force in AI development, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon leading the charge. However, Asia-Pacific, particularly China, is rapidly catching up, driven by significant investments and a robust government push toward AI adoption. The Chinese government has an ambitious AI plan aimed to make the country a global leader in AI by 2030, with projections that the AI industry of China could reach $150 billion in size by then. This geographical diversification is crucial for investors looking to tap into different markets and reduce their risk exposure.\nInvestors should also consider the substantial investments being made in AI startups, which are critical drivers of innovation. According to CB Insights, AI startups raised over $66 billion in funding in 2022, marking a record year despite broader economic uncertainties. This trend is expected to continue as more venture capital firms and corporate investors recognize the potential of AI to disrupt traditional industries. Furthermore, the integration of AI with other emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and quantum computing, is likely to create new opportunities and markets, further driving growth.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. Latest reports suggest that the company has signed an agreement with authorities in Australia to develop novel AI-powered tools for automated vulnerability scanners and data protocols which can quickly identify and assess the impact of open source vulnerabilities on the software supply chains of Australian critical infrastructure operators. Under the deal, Google Cloud will provide infrastructure and solutions, including machine learning and Big Data capabilities, plus domain specific large language models, to accelerate research and translate it into tools or as-a-service offerings. Alphabet plans to spend more than $670 million in Australia till 2026.\nAs media reports indicate that the Department of Justice in the US might pursue a breakup of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), prominent Wall Street analyst Daniel Ives, who works at Wedbush, has said that such a development would be a stretch with Google likely to appeal the rulings which might be in the court system for years. He said investors should not expect any disruption to the near-term operations of the firm. However, he cautioned that the business model tweaks and heavier scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions will be front and center for big tech in the coming months.\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Alphabet's estimated fair value is US$254 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nCurrent share price of US$166 suggests Alphabet is potentially 35% undervalued\nOur fair value estimate is 24% higher than Alphabet's analyst price target of US$205\nHow far off is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$91.3b\nUS$105.0b\nUS$114.2b\nUS$130.5b\nUS$141.9b\nUS$151.8b\nUS$160.2b\nUS$167.7b\nUS$174.4b\nUS$180.6b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x19\nAnalyst x13\nAnalyst x4\nAnalyst x3\nEst @ 8.80%\nEst @ 6.91%\nEst @ 5.59%\nEst @ 4.66%\nEst @ 4.01%\nEst @ 3.56%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% \nUS$85.4k\nUS$91.9k\nUS$93.5k\nUS$99.9k\nUS$101.7k\nUS$101.8k\nUS$100.5k\nUS$98.4k\nUS$95.8k\nUS$92.8k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$962b\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.5%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$181b\u00d7 (1 + 2.5%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.5%) = US$4.2t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.2t\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$2.2t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$3.1t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$166, the company appears quite good value at a 35% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alphabet as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.065. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nWhilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other fast money stocks.\nAs the financial world grapples with shifting economic indicators and political uncertainty, insights from leading experts offer a crucial perspective on what lies ahead. With inflation showing signs of easing and the Federal Reserve signaling a likely rate cut, the focus now shifts to earnings performance and broader economic trends. Adding to this complexity are political developments, such as the possibility of a Republican sweep.\nThe latest June 2024 inflation report revealed a softer-than-expected outcome, causing varied reactions across major stock indices. Initially, futures surged in response, but have since fluctuated. Currently, the Dow is showing gains, the S&P is up slightly, and the NASDAQ is just below the flatline. Inflation dropped by a tenth of a percent month-over-month, contrary to economists' forecasts of a rise.\nChris Harvey, Head of Equity Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, and Mike Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JPMorgan, shared their perspectives on the current financial situation in an episode of CNBC's Fast Money. Chris Harvey is cautious about the concept of market rotation due to ongoing uncertainties about earnings. While he doesn't oppose rotation, he pointed out that investor confidence is still shaky.\n\"That\u2019s right. We\u2019re not against rotation; we\u2019re just waiting for more clarity. Many investors are uncertain about earnings. Until we see a situation where companies don\u2019t go down on bad news, we won\u2019t be fully convinced about the rotation. We want people to believe that numbers will improve and that things will get better. However, right now, bad news is bad news, and that suggests the rotation may not be sustainable.\"\nIn contrast, Mike Feroli discussed the anticipated rate cuts. He believes that the Fed is likely to lower rates soon due to its more aggressive stance. Feroli suggests that the economy is weaker than some might think, which supports the expectation of rate cuts. He noted that we have probably reached the peak for interest rates and that future attention will shift to earnings performance.\nFeroli also explained why he updated his forecast to September. This change is based on recent CPI data showing significant inflation drops over the past year and a rise in unemployment. He expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, with additional cuts likely on a quarterly basis.\n\"Yes, the rate cuts are coming. The Fed has signaled their intention to cut rates more aggressively than they have in the past. We also believe the economy isn\u2019t as strong as some might think, so we expect rates to come down. I think we\u2019ve already hit the peak for rates. Right now, it\u2019s really about earnings.\"\nHowever, if the labor market weakens further, the pace of these cuts could accelerate. Regarding the potential impact of a Donald Trump presidency and a possible Republican sweep, Feroli highlighted the uncertainties. A Republican sweep could lead to more tax cuts, possibly extending or expanding those from 2017, which might boost growth but also increase deficits.\nAdditionally, trade and immigration policies remain unpredictable. While deregulation might mitigate some negative effects, the overall policy environment is still uncertain. Finally, when asked about the implications of a Republican sweep for bond markets, Feroli expressed concern about the deficit trajectory. Extending all tax cuts, particularly in a more Republican-leaning scenario, could exacerbate the deficit problem.\nIn another episode of Fast Money, Chris Mman, Chief Investment Officer at Lafayette College, discussed the potential timing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, emphasizing that September appears to be a strong possibility. He notes, however, that the Fed will be influenced by upcoming economic reports. Mman also highlights concerns over equity valuations and the potential impact of delayed rate cuts on the labor market.\n\"I believe July should have been on the table based on today\u2019s report. However, the Fed usually prefers to signal their plans in advance. My expectation was that they probably wouldn't preemptively set up for September, but given today\u2019s report, it seems quite likely they will. The Fed might use upcoming meetings and communications to guide the market's expectations.\"\nAs political uncertainties, including the Democratic ticket's spotlight, add to the mix, Mman reassures that the Fed is likely to focus on economic data rather than political pressures. He stresses that while inflation remains a critical issue, the Fed's priority will be managing employment trends to avoid a deeper economic downturn.\n\"Even if inflation accelerates temporarily, it\u2019s unlikely to concern the Fed greatly. Currently, the focus has shifted more to employment reports rather than inflation. If employment were to unexpectedly strengthen, it could reduce the Fed\u2019s incentive to cut rates. Ultimately, the goal is to avoid a severe economic slowdown that would force them into aggressive rate cuts.\"\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we review recent episodes of CNBC's Fast Money, where Fast Money traders highlighted stocks with high growth potential. We tracked each stock mentioned and ranked them based on frequency. From this, we identified the top 7 stocks that were mentioned a lot by Fast Money traders and were widely held by hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

The company\u2019s core advertising business is rebounding after a challenging 2022-2023 period, when advertisers curtailed spending due to economic concerns. While this quarter\u2019s exceptional growth rate may not persist, Alphabet\u2019s performance indicates it is likely to exceed our annual projections.\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best fast money stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other advertising stocks.\nWhen compared to the copy driven model of the late 1900s as popularized by shows such as Mad Men, the advertising era of 2024 is completely different. Today, advertisers have at their disposal the data of billions of people which they can characterize according to preference and target their ads to. This growth in digital advertising has been driven by the rise of video streaming platforms and digital publications, which continue to gain market share over paper newspapers.\nNowhere else is the impact of digital advertising in today's era clear as through the value of the world's largest search engine company. A mega cap stock, this firm has a market value of a whopping $2 trillion, making it one of the largest companies in the world in terms of market value. Yet, in another case of 2024 being a historic year of shifts for the technology industry as evidenced by technologies such as artificial intelligence, this firm is also facing the heat from the US government which might end up changing the very fabric of the industry.\nThe search engine giant, which earned $187 billion in trailing twelve month revenue from search and advertising, traces its roots back to the late 1990s when its founders created an algorithm called PageRank. This software determined which webpages were authoritative based on the amount and quality of backlinks they got, and as the engine grew, so did the firm's dominance in the global advertising industry as it processes more than 22 billion searches per day. However, this gravy train might be ending as a Washington judge ruled in August that its $26 billion in payments to other firms to make the platform the default option on their devices was an anti competitive behavior that locked others out in the industry.\nFollowing the ruling, there are rumors that the Justice Department might be considering breaking the company up by making it divest its mobile software and web browsing business divisions. However, any such decision will require court approval which will force the firm to comply. And while a court victory is great for news headlines, the US government has rarely broken up large companies in the modern era. The last such case was in 1982 through the breakup of the Bell System, and even if the browser and OS were made separate businesses, they are unlikely to survive on their own since both are provided to users for free.\nNot to mention, the long drawn nature of anti-trust action could take years, and end up being enforced when the industry is vastly different from what it is now. This is because artificial intelligence is gnawing at the heels of the industry, with products such as OpenAI's SearchGPT already in early stage releases. Speaking of AI, it's also making its mark on the advertising industry. Just as advertisers are able to rely on millions of users' data through search and social media platforms, AI helps them navigate through this data in novel and new ways.\nAs per McKinsey, marketing and sales could see a $931 billion productivity boost from AI through new features such as personalized campaigns and improved data use. These use cases have already become apparent, with the largest social media company in the world regularly sharing updates about how it is using AI to make advertisers' jobs easier on its platform. Two tools that it offers are the Advantage+ and Advantage+ Shopping platform which enables advertisers and sellers to automate their campaign operations and determine the best advertisements to run. The platforms also appear to be driving results, with the firm quoting a study that is \"demonstrating 22% higher return on ad spend for US advertisers after they adopted Advantage+ Shopping campaigns\" with revenue for the firm through the two AI platforms doubling annually during Q1 2024.\nSpeaking of revenue, the advertising industry's spending, which determines the fate of publishers is also determined by the state of the economy, consumer confidence, and advertisers' outlook. One such firm with brands in more than 100 companies shared during its Q2 2024 earnings call that while the advertising market is not at its best right now, it does appear to be recovering. This recovery is taking place in areas such as food and technology which joins strong performance in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and beauty care. Another publisher, which is one of the most well known digital media and lifestyle platforms in the world that relies on programmatic advertising (data driven user targeting through ads), saw its programmatic revenue grow by 3% annually during Q2 even as broader advertising revenue dropped by 19% annually.\nWith these details in mind let's take a look at which advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers. For stocks that are driving advertising technology, you should check out 8 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy Now.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the best advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers, we listed the NASDAQ and NYSE listings of an advertising ETF by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short and selected the stocks with the lowest percentage. An added 23 stocks after an internet search were also analyzed, but all these had market caps below $300 million so they were excluded.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) is the world's largest social media operator and one of the biggest players in the digital advertising industry. Its advertising business allows businesses to place ads on Google's different platforms, such as its search engine, and on websites that partner up with it. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also allows its advertising customers to customize their campaigns by targeting keyword based searches. While estimates show that the firm commands more than 50% of the search based advertising market, research shows that the general purpose nature of Google's search engine is hurting it as businesses choose to divert their spending to custom search platforms like Amazon.com, Inc.'s Amazon website. Additionally, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is also facing a lot of regulatory headwinds with reports suggesting that the Justice Department might break it up. Even still, this might not be its biggest problem, as the firm might struggle if OpenAI or another firm offers a superior web search product that uses AI to enhance user experience.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\"\nOverall GOOG ranks 2nd on our list of the best advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other artificial intelligence stocks recommended by financial media.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has now become a technology that most people are increasingly familiar with. With AI seeping into almost every aspect of life, from the ads you see on social media apps to the autonomous driving cars many consumers are shifting to. It's not an overstatement to say that AI has become part and parcel of everyday life for every person using technology today. Considering the widespread use and application of AI technology, this area of the market has become an exciting area to invest in today.\nWith the recent big tech companies' earnings being released, many investors are wondering what role AI is playing in the tech markets today, and how it will develop. On August 2, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi joined CNBC's \"The Exchange\" to discuss this very development. Here are some of his comments:\n\"I think what's happening is two things. On the one hand, it's macroeconomy, which has been sort of turbulent for a long period of time, and it seems to be now coming to an end, where we see it on the job market and people are seeing it on inflation and the 10-year coming down and so on. On the other hand, we see AI. People are very excited, they know it's gonna absolutely change the whole world, and that huge investments have been done by the hyperscalers in AI. But for us as a company, we've been investing in data and AI for the 10 years, and you know we see a steady growth revenue and customers getting value out of it, but theres been a huge deployment of capital... I think AI is gonna be amazing, it's gonna keep providing value.\"\nGhodsi's comments clarify the market's current opinion on AI, namely that this is an area of tech that cannot be ignored and must be invested in to the maximum. However, in light of such a market opinion, many investors may be beginning to wonder whether the huge amounts of investments being made in AI are justified or whether we are merely in what some may call an \"AI bubble\" that is definitely going to burst. Considering the immense value to be found in AI, though, many investors believe that such huge deployments of capital are, in fact, justified.\nConsidering the above, it's unsurprising that several big tech companies are part of the rat race to invest in and develop AI technologies. However, one notable absence in most lists of the best AI stocks to buy that are being made by financial media reporters is that of Apple. Many investors are beginning to take note of the fact that it is lagging behind other big tech companies that are rapidly developing AI tech. On August 6, Lightshed Partners' Walter Piecyk's shared his view on the smartphone maker's AI moves on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\".\n\"I signed up as a developer for the latest development or the latest release of iOS 18. I've been using the intelligent series - not that much better... There's a lot of work that's obviously gonna be done between now and when this is formally released. I just don't see it, for this year and for next year having some a big impact.\"\nInvestors may be better served by shifting to purer AI plays.

        "Title": "Alphabet and Meta Platforms Just Sent a Major Warning to Nvidia Shareholders",
        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the booming spending on artificial intelligence (AI) development. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are a key piece of infrastructure for training and running large language models, the backbone of generative AI. Big tech companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on as many Nvidia GPUs as possible right now.\nThat's been great for Nvidia and its shareholders. Sales more than tripled in its fiscal first quarter, reaching a record $26 billion in total revenue. But that kind of growth can't last forever.\nAnalysts expect more modest sales growth of \"just\" 38.4% next year. But some comments from Nvidia's biggest customers suggest that number might be too high.\nWhile Nvidia has seen its profits soar as a result of all the AI spending, the same isn't necessarily true of a lot of its biggest customers. A step up in capital expenditures like those required to build AI data centers can be a crunch on cash flow. That's especially true if those investments don't produce an immediate impact on revenue.\nThat's the challenge for cloud providers that rent computing infrastructure to developers. The three largest cloud providers are Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. If a developer comes to one of them and needs access to compute power they don't have, it will go to one of its competitors. As a result, they need to build data centers fast enough amid the current AI boom to ensure when a new customer comes to them, or an existing customer asks for more capacity, they can serve them.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai made this clear when asked about spending on AI during the company's second-quarter earnings call. \"I think the one way I think about it is when we go through a curve like this, the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here,\" he told analysts. In other words, he's intentionally overspending right now to ensure he gets as many customers as possible. Microsoft and Amazon are likely taking a similar approach.\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms is building its own data center capacity to support its AI development. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has ambitions of turning Meta into the leading AI company in the world. And that requires having the infrastructure in place before the company's software is ready for training and deployment.\n\"It's hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future, but at this point I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new infra projects,\" he said during Meta's second-quarter earnings call.\nHis comments echo Pichai's. Meta is spending now with the expectation that it will grow into its capacity. At some point, however, it will rightsize its data centers. At that point, it will significantly slow down its spending on servers and chips like Nvidia's.\nThe reason Nvidia shareholders should pay attention to everything Pichai, Zuckerberg, and a few other big-tech executives say about their AI spending is that the business has become heavily concentrated on those customers.\nTwenty-four percent of Nvidia's total sales in the first quarter came from just two customers. Between 60% and 70% of its revenue comes from just 10 customers, according to Seligman Investments analyst Paul Wick.\nWith all that revenue highly concentrated among just a handful of customers, a single change in the capital expenditure policy at one of them could drastically impact Nvidia's results. If Alphabet or Meta decide to cut back on spending in a couple of years after aggressively building capacity, Nvidia will see its growth slow considerably.\nThe stock is in a precarious position, with Nvidia shares trading at valuation multiples, with around 50x forward earnings and 40x enterprise value to revenue. If it continues to outperform management's guidance and analysts' expectations, the stock will continue zooming higher. But one quarter of poor results could send shares reeling. The comments from Alphabet and Meta suggest it may be only a matter of time before there's a stark pullback in AI spending.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other important AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence has led to a much-needed market rally in the technology industry over the past year. The benchmark S&P 500, dominated by tech giants, is up nearly 20% in the past year. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite is up over 21%. In light of easing inflation numbers and rate cuts, market analysts had forecast a jump in interest around growth options for 2024. However, the AI buzz has served to snowball this ordinary interest into an extraordinary wave of optimism around the whole economy. Although tech stocks have been the biggest beneficiary, there is little doubt that AI will soon penetrate other sectors of the economy, from manufacturing and supply chain, to transportation, entertainment, and retail.\nThere are numbers that illustrate this argument in quantifiable terms. Across the economic spectrum, investments in AI are increasing at a rapid pace. For example, according to a recent report on the AI industry by renowned investment bank Goldman Sachs, established businesses around the world are expected to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years. Investments in AI startups are also booming. So far in 2024, venture capital firms have made around 200 deals with AI firms, investing nearly $22 billion. The average size of a round of funding for AI startups is more than $100 million with an average valuation of more than $1 billion. In contrast, these numbers for non-AI startups are $20 million and $200 million.\nKey players who were early to catch on to the AI trend have leapfrogged competitors. Stocks of companies that make graphics processing units (GPUs), specialized AI chips, and generative AI products have soared. In general, the median returns of AI-linked firms on the S&P 500 are 20% compared to 2% for non-AI stocks. On the NASDAQ Composite, AI firms are responsible for 90% of the overall returns on the border index. Analysts expect these gains to translate into earnings and GDP growth. Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, argues that in the next ten years, AI is likely to automate 25% of all work tasks and raise US productivity by 9% and GDP growth by more than 6%.\nResearch presented in the keynote address to the 2024 EMW Conference by Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management suggests that these gains may be the beginning of a new super cycle for the tech industry, following previous cycles such as PCs in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s that led to the popularity of the cloud. However, investors have more reason to be optimistic about this growth since it compares favorably to cycles of the past. Software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan contend that tech companies seem to be investing in AI products by tying the spending to the revenues, ensuring a safety net that had not existed in previous cycles.\nSince the beginning of the AI wave in early 2023 following the launch of ChatGPT by California-based Open AI, the focus of the industry has shifted from software towards AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure firms have added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since the first quarter of 2023. Before a killer AI application can emerge or large scale AI automation can begin - Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist at MIT, predicts this will take more than a decade - new areas of AI infrastructure are emerging. These include utilities, energy, internet, and industrials (see 20 Industrial Stocks That Are Already Riding the AI Wave). The gains of prominent utility, industrial, energy, and internet firms critical to AI development rival the returns of traditional AI stocks.\nInvestments in energy and utilities are important if this AI potential is to be realized. Goldman analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect the proliferation of AI technology and the accompanying need to maintain data centers to drive an increase in demand for utilities that has not been seen in a generation. It remains to be seen, however, if the pace at which AI is progressing will keep pace with investments in power. This is because the utilities sector is highly regulated and has supply chain constraints that will not be easily overcome. If investments are made at the levels needed, it might still be a few years before their full benefits make their way towards AI firms.\nAll this hullabaloo around AI has investors on edge, with ghosts of previous bubbles haunting their memories. Although comparisons to the past are the surest way of finding your footing in unfamiliar territory, data shows that this may not be the wisest strategy considering present market dynamics. For example, at the height of the dotcom bubble just before the turn of the millennium, some software firms were trading at 132x their earnings. The five-year average for this value in 1999 was only 37x. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks were trading at P/E multiples of around 39x. The five-year average for this last year was 40x, showcasing why AI valuations may not be overextended.\nIndeed, AI firms can target multi-trillion dollar valuations, in line with some of the biggest software and internet firms on the market presently. That is the revolutionary power of AI technology. Over the past decade, tech giants have achieved a scale that few other businesses have before them. By combining billions in users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income, these handful of firms have reached 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. They are category leaders in fields such as smartphones, ecommerce, cloud, and software as a service (SaaS) - all of which AI promises to disrupt - and ahead of competitors in research and development spending. This is why many of these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business models, in hopes of holding onto their thrones.\nSome investors remain concerned about AI firms bullying software companies on the market in the near and long term. A cursory glance at the Price-to-Sale (PS) ratios for software stocks in the past decade reveals that after topping out in 2021, the valuations for SaaS firms are near their all time lows. Some of this pessimism around software can also be attributed to slower earnings growth. Coatue research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS stocks expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% at the peak of the Saas craze. As the future of human-machine interaction moves towards communication in natural language, software firms who adapt to AI changes are more likely to survive than those that do not.\nAs the markets become decoupled from rate hikes, inflation figures go down, and the prospects of a soft landing become brighter, the macro outlook for AI looks favorable as well. The main driver for future S&P 500 growth in terms of earnings remains AI. According to Coatue research, in the next three years, AI-linked stocks will grow at a compound annual rate of almost 20%, beating their non-AI counterparts by nearly 14 percentage points. 40% of the earnings from tech will be accelerated by AI tailwinds in the period. All indicators point towards a brighter future for AI investors in the long term.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI infrastructure stocks with more than 25% gains in 2024 that are also popular among hedge funds. These are the best AI stocks to buy according to the market participants and hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. The firm is investing heavily in the AI space, developing several AI products, building AI data centers to power these products, and developing AI-focused chips. In late July, media reports indicated that Apple, one of the rivals of Alphabet in the software space, used AI chips designed by Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, to build two key components of AI software infrastructure for a forthcoming suite of AI tools and features. This was in contrast to other tech giants who turned to NVIDIA for these chips.\nSundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), said during the second quarter earnings call that year-to-date, the AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers offered by the company had already generated billions in revenues and were being used by more than 2 million developers.\nOverall GOOG ranks 24th on our list of the most important AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Hottest 10 Stock Picks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against Jim Cramer's other stock picks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer talked about what he sees as Wall Street's biggest oversights this earnings season, especially on a day when the Dow dropped 141 points, and the NASDAQ advanced 0.2%. Cramer highlighted the misleading narratives surrounding the impact of GLP-1 drugs on food and beverage companies, the reluctance to lower prices post-pandemic, the skepticism around AI investments, and the persistent belief that\nIntel remains dominant in the tech sector.\nCramer argues that if companies were more honest about their changing situations, they would gain credibility and potentially boost their stock prices. Instead, by withholding important details, they leave investors confused and more likely to make poor decisions.\n\"If companies just own up to their own changing circumstances, things would be so much easier for everybody. But who wants to admit mistakes? They earn a lot of credibility for themselves leading the higher stock prices down the line, instead their stocks languish as investors try to assess what's really going on and they presume the worst not the best.\" said Cramer.\nIn a time filled with so much misinformation, Cramer emphasized how easy it is to be misled and underscored the need to recognize these gaps. According to Cramer, despite approximately 20 million Americans reportedly using GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs, food and beverage companies refuse to acknowledge any negative impact of these medications. They won\u2019t even suggest it. Cramer argues that their denial of the effects of GLP-1 drugs is simply untrue.\n\"We know that people eat much less when they take these GLP-1s and consume less snack food because it tamps down on cravings. ...These drugs are incredibly powerful. The idea they aren't doing damage to the snack food companies is insane.\"\nCramer commented on the rising prices, stating that most companies see no need to lower them, despite significant hikes during the pandemic. He pointed out that airlines, which have consistently underperformed, refuse to reduce fares, behaving as if the price hikes never happened.\n\"In the airlines, there are endless underperformers, they simply wouldn't roll back prices, they act as if they didn't even take them up in the first place.\"\nThe same goes for hotels and entertainment venues, which sharply increased prices during the pandemic and now resist lowering them, even as demand forecasts decline. Cramer also noted that many restaurants either claim their price hikes haven't hurt sales or refuse to acknowledge the need to roll back prices.\n\"They raised prices drastically during the pandemic. They won't cap the raising prices too much even as the forecast is coming down hard.\"\nDiscussing AI, Cramer strongly disagrees with Wall Street's claim that AI investments are a waste of money. He points out that many believe big companies spending heavily on AI-related video chips aren't seeing any significant returns, and are only investing to keep up with competitors (see 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\n\"We're constantly being told that none of the big companies spending a fortune in video chips for AI has seen any meaningful return on that investment. They're only doing it to prevent their competitors from getting an edge. That's what we keep on hearing. That's absurd!\"\nCramer also challenged the common belief that INTC remains a leader in its sector. He dismissed claims that the company is poised for a major comeback, particularly in data centers, and that it has a chip capable of rivaling its competitors' dominance. He pointed out that the company's financial health tells a different story, citing the company's decision to cut its dividend last year and suspend the remainder this year. According to Cramer, these actions don't signal dominance, and he warned that this is not the same semiconductor company it once was, despite what the company might claim.\n\"I keep hearing that Intel's gonna make a huge comeback that is catching up the others in the data center. That the data center has an Nvidia killer in GE-3. That it's using the chips to sack money from you and further it's dominance. Dream on! Have you seen Intel's balance sheet? Can you read one? Do you think a company that cut its dividend last year and then suspends what was left of it this year in order to assert its dominance?! Look, this is not the Intel of old even though we want it to be. Despite Intel's protestations, I wouldn't want to be Intel's partner.\"\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors:165\nJim Cramer pointed out that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) isn't just purchasing video chips for AI out of general concern about competition. Instead, they're particularly worried that Meta might overtake them, and Cramer believes this concern is justified.\n\"Google aren't buying because they're worried that the other guys might do something. They're specifically worried that Meta is going to catch and pass them and they should be.\"\nAlphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s extensive ecosystem, including Android, Chrome, Google Maps, and YouTube, enhances user engagement and drives revenue growth through its interconnected services. In Q2 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported $85 billion in revenue, a 14% year-over-year increase, largely driven by a 29% rise in Google Cloud revenue to $10.35 billion.\nCooper Investors Global Equities Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cUnsurprisingly the portfolio\u2019s best performers in the very short term reflect this pattern, having narrowed to those most obviously exposed to the AI story \u2013 TSMC and\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). While the portfolio has owned semiconductor companies for years it remains diversified and is underweight the group from an active risk perspective, dragging on relative performance in the last six months. The portfolio is currently positioned to take advantage of the Value Latency we see in smaller sized companies, and the performance of the quarter has been more aligned with those factors.\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Alphabet (GOOGL). Shares have lost about 3.9% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Alphabet due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\nAlphabet\u2019s second-quarter 2024 earnings of $1.89 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.2%. The figure grew 31.3% year over year.Revenues of $84.74 billion increased 14% year over year (15% at constant currency).Net revenues, excluding total traffic acquisition costs (\u201cTAC\u201d) (the portion of revenues shared with Google\u2019s partners, and the amount paid to distribution partners and others who direct traffic to Google\u2019s website), were $71.35 billion, which surpassed the consensus mark by 1.1%. The figure rose 15% from the year-ago quarter.TAC of $13.4 billion rose 6.8% year over year.Solid momentum across Search and YouTube contributed well. The growing cloud segment was a major positive. Accelerating advertisement revenues acted as tailwinds.However, Alphabet continued to witness sluggishness in Google Network ads, which was concerning.Nevertheless, the company\u2019s growing investments in AI, and strength in its Search and cloud businesses are likely to yield massive returns in the days ahead. Growing momentum in Generative AI is another positive.\nAlphabet reports revenues under Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets.Google Services:Revenues from the Google Services business increased 11.5% year over year to $73.93 billion, accounting for 87.2% of the total revenues. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $73.43 billion.Under this business, search revenues from Google-owned sites increased 13.8% year over year to $48.51 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $47.5 billion.YouTube\u2019s advertising revenues improved 13% year over year to $8.7 billion, while Network advertising revenues decreased 5.2% to $7.44 billion.

        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shareholders have seen the share price descend 12% over the month. But that doesn't change the fact that shareholders have received really good returns over the last five years. It's fair to say most would be happy with 173% the gain in that time. To some, the recent pullback wouldn't be surprising after such a fast rise. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean it's cheap now.\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Alphabet achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 23% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 22%. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Alphabet has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.\nIt's nice to see that Alphabet shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 25% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 22%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. Is Alphabet cheap compared to other companies?

From our perspective, the figures were largely as expected and there was no cause for us to change our assumptions nor estimates.

Discover the potential of this market before other investors.\nThe report indicates a push to break up Google would be the first attempt to dismantle a company for monopolization since regulators unsuccessfully attempted to break up Microsoft more than two decades ago. If the DOJ moves forward with the breakup plan, the Android operating system and Google Chrome are the most likely units for divestment.\nThe DOJ is reportedly exploring less severe options as well, including forcing the company to share more data with competitors in an effort to stop Google from gaining an unfair advantage in its AI products.\nRegardless, people familiar with the matter said the government is likely to try to put an end to the type of contracts that were scrutinized in the recent case against Google.\nCheck It Out:\nReal estate is a wealth builder for the nation\u2019s 1%.

Alphabet has said it will appeal that decision.\nGoogle is the most-used search engine in the world with more than $300 billion in annual revenue.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this internet search leader have returned -13% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -4.8% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 11.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share, indicating a change of +18.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.62 points to a change of +31.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.62 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $72.73 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $296.37 billion and $330.33 billion estimates indicate +15.5% and +11.5% changes, respectively.\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.\u00a0Since Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nTech stocks are continuing to decline amid fears the Fed is taking too long to begin interest rate cuts, stoked by the latest jobs data that showed unemployment is rising. However, some analysts believe the latest decline in AI stocks is part of a normal market rotation and gives investors an opportunity to buy. While talking to CNBC in a latest program, Michael Landsberg of Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth said that the latest decline is a \u201clittle bit of a reset, obviously.\u201d The analyst said that AI stocks had a \u201cgreat run\u201d and the latest pullback is a \u201ctypical process\u201d of market rotation.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we are not positive longer term on AI but when you have big runs like that that\u2019s why you rebalance portfolios to keep the risk in check,\u201d Landsberg said.\nAsked if the AI bubble has popped and this is the end of the AI hype, the analyst said \u201cabsolutely not\u201d and called the recent pullback \u201cdeceleration\u201d from growth and \u201cnormalization.\u201d\nLandsberg said that the earnings season will \u201cseparate the wheat from the chaff\u201d and believes major tech companies will still drive earnings in the future.\nFor this article, we scanned the latest AI news, earnings, and analyst ratings and picked the 10 biggest stocks moving on these developments. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nGoogle\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt said in a fresh note that OpenAI\u2019s SearchGPT will likely remain an \u201coverhang\u201d for Google as investors find out the possible impact of the tool on Google\u2019s search business. The analyst however said Google\u2019s search business is \u201chighly defensible\u201d and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search advancements are underappreciated by the market.\n\u201cWe think the advantages of this existing infrastructure are understated and overlooked and we continue to believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is best positioned to optimize generative AI search results for usability, monetization, and cost.\u201d\nDevitt reiterated an Outperform rating for the stock and $205 price target.\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares slipped recently following reports that OpenAI is working on a web search product called SearchGPT. Before that, the stock fell following earnings despite posting strong numbers. Revenue in the second quarter jumped 14% year over year driven by search and Cloud. At a forward P/E of 22, analysts believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0continues to be one of the cheapest AI stocks in the market as its valuation remains depressed amid fears caused by an overreaction.\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels. \u00a0With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market.\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet\u2019s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts\u2019 forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) \u00a0is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\nDeepwater\u2019s Gene Munster thinks that Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is going to win the \u201cAI arms race.\u201d While talking to CNBC, the analyst said that Google search business is \u201cintact, no need to worry.\u201d Munster\u2019s thesis is based on his in-depth testing of several large language models and chatbots including Google\u2019s Gemini. Munster also thinks other chatbots do not offer a strong imperative for users to switch from Google search as of yet.\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives in a fresh note named Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) as one of the stocks that can benefit from the AI boom.\nAccording to a latest UBS report, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls in all three layers of the AI value chain \u2013 enabling, intelligence and application layer. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an AI enabling player because of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform, while Gemini makes it a key player in the intelligence layer. On the application layer, UBS believes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has an edge with its Duet AI assistant and advertising. All these catalysts make Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) a company that could benefit from the $1.2 trillion AI opportunity by 2027, UBS said.\nConventum \u2013 Alluvium Global Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG), ie Google / YouTube, returned 20.8%. Although management reported good news \u2013 solid quarterly results, the expectation of margin expansion throughout 2024, as well as a maiden dividend (to add to its share repurchases) \u2013 we suspect the share price bounce was as much related to AI euphoria as it was to that positive news. From our perspective, the figures were largely as expected and there was no cause for us to change our assumptions nor estimates. Clearly Alphabet now trades at a larger premium to our valuation, but given the conservativeness of that valuation, in our view the premium is still not so much as to warrant selling. It represents 5.3% of the Fund.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.\u00a0While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) were sliding today on a report from Bloomberg last night that the U.S. Department of Justice was considering a full-scale breakup of the company following earlier lawsuits, including a ruling by a judge last week that said payments to companies like Apple and Samsung to be the default search engine on their devices constituted an illegal monopoly.\nAs of 11:35 a.m. ET on Wednesday, Alphabet stock was down 3.2%.\nAccording to Bloomberg, making the case to break up Alphabet is one of the options the department is considering after last week's ruling about the company's efforts to monopolize online search through exclusive agreements.\nIt's important to note that there has been no official move to break up the company, and this is just a news media report. But the recent ruling requires the government to make proposals for restoring competition to the search market, so Alphabet is likely to face some kind of punishment or restriction.\nSeparately, former CEO Eric Schmidt slammed the company in an interview, saying that it had lost its competitive edge by overly embracing work-from-home policies and other work-life balance initiatives, and that it's falling behind rivals in AI like OpenAI and Anthropic.\nRushing to sell Alphabet stock on today's news seems premature. The most likely outcome from last week's ruling seems to be that Google will no longer be allowed to be the default search engine on iPhones and other devices, but that doesn't necessarily mean it would lose its market share dominance since its leadership is arguably based more on force of habit and its reputation as the best search engine. There could be more severe consequences, though.\nWhatever happens, investors should follow the issue, especially with an election around the corner. A new administration in the White House could push tech regulation in one direction or the other.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

It is constantly making efforts to sustain its supremacy as well. The strong adoption of the Apple Watch on the back of useful and advanced features like Cycle Tracking, the Noise app and Activity Trends remains a major positive.\u00a0Garmin is enjoying growing momentum across its adventure watches on the back of feature updates.Garmin recently released new software and feature updates for select smartwatches, including epix (Gen 2), fenix 7, Forerunner, v\u00edvoactive 5 and Venu 3 Series.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc., AbbVie Inc. and Qualcomm Inc., as well as a micro-cap stock Flanigan's Enterprises, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here >>>Alphabet shares have been hit hard in the recent market turmoil, with the stock lagging the Mag 7 group as well as the Zacks Tech sector and the S&P 500 index since mid-July 2024. The immediate catalyst for the sell-off was Alphabet's July 23rd Q2 earnings report when it beat on the top- and bottom-lines but failed to satisfy investors with its ever-rising capex spending levels.\nThe Zacks analyst sees the market's capex fixation as over-done and strongly argues that Alphabet's aggressive spending plans are essential to its status as a leader in the coming AI world.\nThe company remains a leader in the search space and AI investments are critical to it sustaining that lead.\nWell-performing Google Cloud remains the key catalyst. Expanding data centers and growing generative AI capabilities remain major positives for cloud business. Also, integration of generative AI into the company's search engine is expected to sustain its dominance in the search market.Strong efforts to gain a foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. Deepening focus on wearables category and autonomous driving space, is a plus. However, sluggishness in the company's Network advertisement business is a concern. Growing litigation issues and increasing expenses are headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)Shares of AbbVie have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+22.7% vs. +21.1%). The company has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq.Skyrizi and Rinvoq are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications, which should support top-line growth in the next few years AbbVie has several early/mid-stage candidates that have potential to drive long-term growth. Boosted by its new product launches, AbbVie expects to return to robust revenue growth in 2025.However, the company faces several near-term headwinds like Humira's biosimilar erosion, increasing competitive pressure on Imbruvica and slow market growth trend for fillers in the United States and China.(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here >>>)Qualcomm's shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+42.8% vs. +40.0%). The company reported strong third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with the bottom and top lines beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by healthy demand trends in Android handsets and record automotive revenues.The Snapdragon X Series Platform integrated with Qualcomm AI Hub is witnessing significant market traction among leading global PC manufacturers. The company is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor firm for the intelligent edge and has offered bullish guidance for the fourth quarter.However, inventory corrections by clients are impeding sales in the IoT business. Increasing competition in the mobile phone chipset market is likely to strain margins. Rising geopolitical instability and high debt obligation remain concerns.(You can read the full research report on QUALCOMM here >>>)Shares of Flanigan's have declined -0.3% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry's decline of -7.2%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $47.73 million maintains a strong revenue growth, effective cost management, positive cash flow and a solid financial position. New store openings and operational improvements, like NetSuite, bode well.Yet, Flanigan's net income fell 18.6% in first-quarter 2024 despite a 9.7% revenue uptick, highlighting rising costs and potential inefficiencies. Operating expenses rose 10.4%, driven by higher payroll, consultant fees, and food costs, eroding profit margins. High long-term debt poses a financial risk, especially if interest rates rise.Franchise-related revenues fell 8.5%, indicating possible operational issues.

        "Title": "Better Tech Stock: Nvidia vs. Alphabet",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech stocks have been battered and beaten over the last month, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector down 13%. There's not one specific reason for the sell-off, but rather several different ones. Better-than-expected inflation reports at the start of July triggered a slight reshuffle on Wall Street, allowing investors to pull back from the reliability of tech and look into less stable investments.\nThen, midway through the month, the Biden administration proposed more stringent sanctions on chip exports to China. Combined with the start of earnings season at the end of July, many tech stocks slid in recent weeks.\nWhile a market dip can be worrying, it also presents many buying opportunities. The tech industry remains one of the best places to invest for the long term, fueled by innovative companies that never cease to push the envelope. Meanwhile, a sell-off generally means better-priced stocks.\nTwo attractive long-term options are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), with one leading the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market and the other home to a booming cloud business. Either of these companies' stocks would likely be real assets for any portfolio over the long term.\nSo, let's compare these tech giants and determine whether Nvidia or Alphabet is the better stock this year.\nNvidia's stock took a hard tumble over the last 30 days, falling 12%. The dip hasn't been great for current stockholders, but it has made the shares more accessible to new ones thanks to an improved valuation.\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is at one of its lowest levels in months, at about 62. That's high for a P/E and doesn't usually represent a bargain, but it's significantly lower than Nvidia's five-year average P/E of 80.\nThat average saw Nvidia's stock rise more than 2,500% since 2019, suggesting its current position is unlikely to stop it from delivering major gains in the coming years.\nMeanwhile, the company maintains a solid long-term outlook. Nvidia will post its 2025 second-quarter earnings on Aug. 28, an even that will likely boosting its share price. It beat Wall Street estimates for four consecutive quarters, and this quarter will likely follow suit.\nNvidia's chip rival Advanced Micro Devices reported second-quarter 2024 earnings this week. Revenue outperformed forecasts by $12 million as sales in its AI-focused data center segment surged 115% year over year. Considering Nvidia dominates the AI chip industry with an estimated 70% to 95% market share, it could be in for another quarter of beating expectations based on AMD's performance.\nA recent stock slump and an upcoming earnings release could be an excellent time to buy Nvidia before it's too late.\nAlphabet is another exciting way to invest in tech. While Nvidia dominates hardware, Alphabet has reached historic heights with the popularity of its software. Its Android, Chrome, YouTube, and Google have made the company a household name and a thoroughly reliable growth stock.\nAlphabet's shares have risen 178% over the last five years, beating the S&P 500's 82% rise. The company won over investors with consistent reinvestment in itself and financial growth.\nThe tech giant reported its second-quarter earnings last week, beating expectations in multiple areas. Earnings per share came in at $1.89 versus the $1.84 forecast. Net sales rose 14% year over year, landing $450 million above estimates. The quarter was the first time Google Cloud surpassed $10 billion in quarterly revenue and delivered over $1 billion in operating profit.\nThe company slightly missed on YouTube ad revenue, posting $8.7 billion against expectations of $8.9 billion. But sales in the segment still rose 13% year over year, rounding out an overall positive quarter for Alphabet.\nThe second quarter illustrated that Alphabet's advertising division remains a highly profitable business, alongside solid prospects in AI.\nBoth companies are among the most prominent names in tech, but Nvidia and Alphabet are otherwise challenging to compare. Their businesses operate in vastly different areas of the industry. Nvidia predominantly sells its chips to businesses, with part of its sales tied to the consumer market. Meanwhile, Alphabet's core business is digital advertising, and it is making impressive headway in cloud computing.\nHowever, these companies do complement each other. Alphabet requires graphics processing units (GPUs) like Nvidia's to run and expand its cloud services. And Nvidia's business is thriving by selling its chips to companies like Alphabet.\nAs a result, it's worth comparing their valuations to determine which is the better buy.\nAlphabet's stock is currently a far better value than Nvidia's, with a significantly lower P/E and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. These metrics help determine a stock's value, and the lower the figure, the bigger the bargain.\nAs a result, Alphabet's stock is likely a lower-risk investment for now. With a lucrative ad business and expanding role in AI, it's worth picking up over Nvidia right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $657,306!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): A Good Technology Stock To Buy For Long Term",
        "Author": "  Talha Qureshi ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Technology Stocks to Buy for Long Term.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other technology stocks.\nThe technology industry is one of the key drivers of the global economy. According to MGI research, the global technology industry was valued at $8.51 trillion in 2022 and is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.75% to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. In the United States alone the information technology industry drives more than one-third of the national economy.\nOne of the latest trends in the tech industry has been the increasing investments in artificial intelligence by both tech giants and start-up companies. According to a July 3 report by Reuters, the US venture capital funding surged to $55.6 billion during the second quarter of 2024. The funding surged more than 47% on a quarterly basis and was mainly driven by significant investments in artificial intelligence companies including $6 billion raised by Elon Musk\u2019s xAI.\nHowever, over the past few months, the technology sector has seen a major sell-off due to what analysts call an \u201cAI bubble\u201d. The sell-off initiated with investors raising concerns over return on investment regarding the premium they have been paying as capital expenditure on artificial intelligence. On August 5, CNBC reported that the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d US tech companies lost a combined $1 trillion market value at the start of the trading day. As a result, NASDAQ was down 3%, marking the index\u2019s steepest three-week slide in two years.\nWe recently covered the AI tech bubble in detail in 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst. Here\u2019s a glimpse of the article:\n\u201cIn the past few weeks, a major selloff in the technology sector, mostly over concerns about return on investments amid ballooning capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), has hit the stock market, sending valuations crashing and igniting fears of an AI bubble at the marketplace that might be about to burst. However, Stacy Rasgon, who has covered semiconductor stocks, one of the most prominent sectors in the AI world, for over fifteen years, has advised investors to stay the course, terming fears of a bubble as overblown. Rasgon claims that even though chances of an air pocket, used to refer to stock plunges, are 100%, he is confident the time for them is not now. He pointed to the very real and massive AI data center build as an example, predicting it would go on for a few years, helping push AI stocks higher.\u201d\nMichael Landsberg, Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth CIO appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the AI bubble. He believes that the AI bubble hasn\u2019t popped yet and what we saw recently was a reset of the market, where the market resets out-of-sync factors, and does not mean that the analysts are not positive about AI. He further added that a lot of AI companies have had a great past six months and are growing their earnings. He believes that ultimately earnings drive any stock and as far as AI stocks are concerned their earnings are growing and will continue to grow, thereby increasing the price.\nMoreover, Steve Eisman, Neuberger Berman Senior Portfolio Manager appeared on another CNBC interview termed the recent events as a \u201cPsychological Rotation\u201d. He mentioned that this was not a fundamental rotation, which could have been troublesome, rather it is a psychological rotation that will not hold for long. He further mentioned that Artificial intelligence is here to stay for years and he still sees massive growth opportunities for companies investing in AI.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of 10 best technology stocks to buy for the long term we used the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners. We searched for technology stocks and sorted them based on their market capitalization. From these stocks, we selected technology stocks that have been in business for 20 years or more and are expected to stay in business for several decades. Once we had the consolidated list, we ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a multinational conglomerate holding company that operates through Google Services and Google Cloud segments. It is a Magnificent Seven company and one of the best technology stocks to buy for the long term.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was held by 216 hedge funds in Q2 2024 with total stakes worth $35.31 billion. Fisher Asset Management is the top shareholder of the company with position worth $8.86 billion.\nThe major growth engines of the company, advertising and cloud computing are growing at a steady pace. Moreover, the company is exercising its competitive edge by leveraging its AI infrastructure. During Q2 2024, its cloud segment revenue crossed the $10 billion mark for the first time and also delivered more than $1 billion in quarterly profits. Generative AI solutions for cloud customers, which are already being used by over 2 million developers resulted in record revenue for the segment.\nMoreover, the Google Services segment revenue also increased 12% year-over-year to reach $73.9 billion for the quarter, driven by a 14% growth in search and other services revenue. This segment contains 6 major products that are used by more than 2 billion users monthly. Here as well Generative AI solutions proved to be detrimental in driving increased Google search volumes. CEO Sundar Pichai mentioned that despite concerns that Google might lose its search market share to OpenAI, the company's generative AI increased user satisfaction with the results.\nThe competitive edge of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) lies in the fact that it is one of the biggest digital advertisers and public cloud, leveraging AI expertise to drive significant revenue growth and profits. During the quarter the company was able to generate $23.6 billion in net income and delivered a free cash flow of $31.5 billion, indicating robust liquidity.\nIf we look at its 10-year performance, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been growing its revenue by 18%, net income by 21%, and has improved its levered free cash flow by 22%. Analysts expect its earnings to grow by 32% during the year, while the broader market average sits at 4.2%, making it a lucrative opportunity for growth investors.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best technology stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

Wood\u2019s flagship fund ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is down about 18% so far this year and has lost about 75% of its value since hitting its peak in 2021. However, the latest data shows that the innovation-focused investor bought the dip on tech stocks after the latest selloff that shook financial markets globally.\nInvestors have pulled about $2.2 billion from ARK funds in 2024.

This weak employment situation could encourage the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates, according to Wood.\n\u201cInterest rates coming down should be very positive for the equity markets, but they will not arrest a recession very quickly.

        "Author": "  Jessica Mathews ",
        "Text": "In the race to transport people in self-driving taxis, Alphabet\u2019s subsidiary Waymo has emerged as the clear frontrunner.\nOn Tuesday the company announced that its customers were taking more than 100,000 paid rides weekly\u2014double the number from just a few months ago in May. It\u2019s a signal that Waymo is extending its lead over its robo-taxi competitors and that its ride-hailing business could become a meaningful revenue stream for Google\u2019s parent company.\nWaymo\u2019s boost in ridership comes as it ramps up service this year\u2014fully launching commercial rides in San Francisco and starting gradual service in Los Angeles all in the last few months. Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana, who leads the company alongside fellow co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov, said in March that it had started testing self-driving rides in Austin and plans to start full service in that market later this year.\nAs Waymo has entered new cities, its competitors have fallen further behind. General Motors\u2013owned Cruise, which had launched commercial service in San Francisco in 2022, pulled its fleet off the streets after its handling of an accident last fall. While Cruise resumed supervised autonomous driving in some markets in May, it's still using human safety drivers. Amazon-owned Zoox, another robotaxi competitor, has yet to launch passenger service, though employees are taking rides in Las Vegas and Foster City, Calif. China-based startup WeRide, which drove more than 40,000 miles in California last year, just received its California permit to test its vehicles with passengers last week.\nOf course, Waymo, which just released new details about its upcoming sensor system for its vehicle yesterday, has had its own hiccups, too\u2014most recently with locals in the Bay Area. Over the last week, neighbors of a Waymo parking lot complained that its cars were honking overnight.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

We also see considerable risks and uncertainties existing in the AI theme that are not reflected in the Value Latency on offer in many stocks that have surged.\nReturning to the AI story, today the portfolio has around 10% of capital invested across TSMC and Alphabet. Meantime, Alphabet has multiple value levers to \u00a0pull across AI-augmented search, YouTube (now the \u2018must-have\u2019 streaming platform for young people) and Google Cloud.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other AdTech stocks.\nIt goes without saying that the advertisement technology industry happens to be an exciting and ever-evolving sector, as digital advertising continues to dominate the market trends and remains at the forefront when it comes to strategic marketing. According to industry data by Allied Market Research, the global AdTech market was pegged at $748.2 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $2.9 trillion by 2031. This demonstrates a CAGR of ~14.7% from 2022 to 2031.\nThis growth comes off the back of growing digital and internet penetration, increased usage of advanced technology like AI and machine learning, improved prospects for the gaming industry, and growth in social media apps including Facebook, WhatsApp, and others. Some of the top trends dominating the AdTech industry include higher usage of connected TV (CTV) advertising, in-app advertising, and interactive ads.\nThe AdTech market has been bifurcated into solution, advertising type, size of an enterprise, platform, etc. The AdTech industry includes a wide range of companies and products, such as demand-side platforms (DSPs), supply-side platforms (SSPs), ad exchanges, data management platforms (DMPs), and more. Experts are of the view that the global supply-side platform (SSP) market size should touch ~$117.32 billion by 2033. This means that the industry should compound at ~13.3% from 2023 to 2033. This growth is expected to stem from technological advancements, higher consumer demand, and supportive government policies.\nIn the same vein, the demand side platform software market size should touch US$120.1 billion by 2033 on the heels of an improved trend of programmatic advertising and, the need for better targeting along with measurement capabilities for online ads. While the AdTech industry seems promising, inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI) makes it even more appealing.\nGlobal AdTech industry continues to prepare for the complete deprecation of third-party cookies by Google, which makes up ~65% of the web browser market share. This transition seems to be a critical step for enabling user privacy and data security. Artificial Intelligence, because of its capability to process vast amounts of data, should play a crucial role.\nResearch suggests that ~54% of businesses believe that AI offers advertising cost savings and efficiencies and ~30% of marketing professionals decided to earmark more than 40% of their marketing budget to campaigns that are AI-executed. The advent of smart speakers, voice search, and podcasting can help advertisers in creating fresh avenues to connect with target audiences with the help of audio and voice technology.\nWhile advertisers can exploit the opportunities available in the AdTech industry, they need to be wary about challenges such as Ad fraud. These frauds are caused mainly because of bot traffic, domain spoofing, or ad stacking. Some other challenges include inventory quality, ad creativity, and brand safety.\nAI and ML are revolutionizing digital advertising by enabling advertisers to assess vast amounts of data in real time. As a result, the advertisers can make data-driven decisions for optimizing ad campaigns. Advertisers now use algorithmic advertising, personalization, and performance metrics to maximize ROI.\nAI algorithms help in automating media buying, making sure that ads reach the target audience. Personalized ads can be delivered using AI-powered recommendation engines and these engines enable real-time tracking, which can help make quick adjustments to fuel success.\nThe global AdTech industry is expected to compound in the mid-teens range over the next decade. Given that it's still early in its growth story, now is the time to look at some of the best AdTech stocks.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the holdings of SmartETFs Advertising & Marketing Technology ETF and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them. For the purposes, we sifted through Insider Monkey\u2019s hedge fund data for 1Q 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 222\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) owns Google which accounts for 99% of the company's revenue, out of which over 85% is from online ads.\nInvestors and experts continue to favour Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) primarily because of its strong 2Q 2024 results, which were supported by its Cloud business and AI infrastructure business. The tech giant\u2019s revenues came in at $85 billion in 2Q 2024, reflecting a rise of 14% YoY. This increase came on the heels of Search as well as Cloud, which for the first time crossed $10 billion in quarterly revenues and $1 billion in operating profit. Revenue from Google Cloud business went up by ~29% YoY to $10.35 billion.\nOptimism around the Google Cloud business continues to prevail, thanks to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s AI infrastructure and large language models, which continue to gain popularity. This should help the company as demand for cloud-based AI infrastructure and services is anticipated to become a $397.81 billion market (as per Fortune Business Insights). This means that the market should compound at over ~30% during 2023-2030.\nGoogle Cloud revenue has been outpacing the overall revenue growth of the company. Therefore, this significant opportunity in the cloud AI market might fuel the company\u2019s overall growth. The stock currently trades at ~21.51x its forward earnings, which is at a discount compared to Nasdaq-100's NTM earnings multiple of ~24.4x.\nStifel Nicolaus covered the shares of Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL), and gave a \u201cBuy\u201d rating.

As of the first quarter, the stock is held by 222 hedge funds with stakes worth $32.3 billion.\nPatient Capital Management, a value investing firm, released its second quarter 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here is what the firm said about Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL):\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best AdTech stocks to buy.

        "Text": "This week marks 20 years since Alphabet GOOGL\u00a0went public with the holding company being one of the most innovative firms of the 21st Century.\nFormerly known as Google, the iconic search engine pioneer has evolved to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicle production, and healthcare developments among other endeavors.\nAlphabet has also made significant investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies through its Google research team Brain.\nLucrative acquisitions have fueled Alphabet\u2019s growth with its stock up +19% year to date and skyrocketing over +6,000% since going public in 2004 which has dwarfed the gains of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet\u2019s Acquisition History\nAlong the way to being a tech behemoth, Alphabet has acquired over 200 companies with the largest being the $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility in 2012. This acquisition was aimed at accelerating innovation and choice in mobile computing and played a crucial role in implementing the Google Android ecosystem, the largest rival to Apple\u2019s AAPL\u00a0iPhone iOS.\nOther Lucrative Acquisitions\nWhere 2 Technologies (Acquired in 2004 for an estimated $400 million and led to the creation of Google Maps)\nYouTube (Acquired in 2006 for $1.65 billion) - Video and music streaming platform\nDoubleClick (Acquired in 2007 for $3.1 billion and implemented into Google Marketing)\nWaze (Acquired in 2013 for $966 million) -Traffic and navigation app\nNest Labs (Acquired in 2014 for $3.2 billion) - Smart home products\nDeepMind (Acquired in 2014 for $500 million and merged with Brain in regards to AI development)\nTwitch (Acquired in 2014 for $970 million) - Live streaming platform for gamers\nLooker (Acquired in 2019 for $2.6 billion to provide business intelligence software and data analytics in Google Cloud)\nFitbit (Acquired in 2019 for $2.1 billion) - Wearable fitness devices and app\nMandiant (Acquired in 2022 for $5.4 billion) - Independent cybersecurity services also implemented in Google Cloud\nStock Split History \nAlphabet\u2019s brilliant performance has led to the company splitting its stock twice in its history, the most recent being a 20-1 stock split in July of 2022.\nThe first stock split was a 2-1 split in March of 2014. This split also created two classes for shareholders, Class C shares with no voting rights under the ticker symbol GOOG\u00a0and Class A for shareholders with voting rights under the new ticker symbol GOOGL.\u00a0\nImage Source: Macrotrends\nGrowth Trajectory\nBased on Zacks estimates, Alphabet\u2019s total sales are now projected to rise 15% in fiscal 2024 and are slated to increase another 11% in FY25 to $330.36 billion. Annual earnings are expected to soar 31% this year to $7.63 per share versus EPS of $5.80 in 2023. Alphabet\u2019s bottom line is projected to expand another 13% in FY25 to $8.64 per share.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet\u2019s Dividend \nAlphabet recently paid its first-ever dividend in June, which it plans to pay out quarterly with a current yield of 0.48%.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMonitoring Alphabet\u2019s Valuation\nAt current levels, Alphabet\u2019s stock trades at 21.9X forward earnings which is slightly beneath its Zacks Internet-Services Industry average of 23.2X and the S&P 500\u2019s 23.6X. Notably, Alphabet trades nicely beneath its decade-long high of 37X forward earnings and at a discount to the median of 26X during this period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRecent Headwinds & Average Zacks Price Target \nAttributed to its dominance, some of the headwinds Alphabet has faced pertain to regulatory issues. Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) ruled that Google has illegally monopolized the online search and text advertising markets. Implementations of such could potentially lead to forcible actions against Alphabet to break up its businesses or the restriction of certain services.\nStill, the Average Zacks Price Target of $204.71 a share suggests 22% upside in Alphabet\u2019s stock from current levels.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConclusion\nOver the years, Alphabet\u2019s stock has taken its shareholders on a wonderful ride and has certainly been a millionaire maker for early investors. That said, GOOGL currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as the next wave of gains may take some time considering potential antitrust headwinds from the DOJ although Alphabet remains one of the most innovative companies to invest in.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe AI industry continues to be highly dynamic, with significant growth anticipated across various sectors in 2024. The expansion of generative AI, which saw exponential growth in 2023, is expected to continue this year, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value as businesses move from pilot projects to broader implementation. This shift suggests that 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI as companies aim to leverage capabilities more fully to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate across different industries. The market for generative AI is forecasted to grow rapidly, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 60%, reaching a valuation of around $37 billion by 2028. This growth is fueled by the widespread adoption of AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and Billionaire Druckenmiller is Betting on AI\nThe AI revolution is already transforming operations across the world by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and enhancing predictive capabilities. The healthcare sector, for example, is poised for substantial advancements due to AI, with the market expected to grow to around $188 billion by 2030, driven by innovations in genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. Edge computing is another area likely to see significant development in 2024, as it becomes increasingly critical for enabling AI applications that require real-time data processing. The move towards edge computing, where data is processed closer to the source, is expected to reduce latency and improve the performance of AI systems, particularly in sectors like autonomous vehicles, IoT, and industrial automation.\nThis trend underscores the growing importance of a robust semiconductor supply chain, especially as global trade tensions and geopolitical events continue to impact the availability of critical components like chips. Experts also emphasize the growing importance of ethical considerations and responsible AI. As AI technologies become more deeply embedded in various aspects of society, concerns around privacy, bias, and security are likely to intensify, prompting calls for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. The rapid growth will also bring challenges related to talent acquisition, supply chain management, and the need for responsible AI practices. As such, the industry is likely to be marked by both tremendous opportunities and complex challenges in the near term.\nREAD ALSO 10 Best Small-Cap AI Stocks to Buy and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

Latest reports indicate that the company will soon release the people generating feature of Gemini, the artificial intelligence assistant.

This development is important because the feature, not offered by Google competitors so far, will be available to users subscribed to paid Gemini plans, including Gemini Advanced, Business or Enterprise. Google has modified the image-generating model in Gemini for the new launch.\nAnother exciting development regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) comes from news agency Reuters.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0\u00a015 Best Stocks to Buy According to Hosking Partners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other best stocks to buy according to Hosking Partners.\nHosking Partners was established in 2013 by Jeremy Hosking as an independent partnership that offers a single global equity strategy. The firm appeals to investors seeking long-term returns and innovative thinking employing a capital cycle approach to investing. It has a diverse set of stocks in its portfolio that belong to a variety of industries consisting of AI, shipping, and financial services, among others. Jeremy Hosking earned an MA from the University of Cambridge, after which he served Marathon Asset Management 26 years as a founding partner and lead portfolio manager. There he contributed to developing the capital cycle approach to investment.\nIn its recent blog about shipping, Hosking Partners believes that understanding the cycles in different classes of shipping and global trends is essential for successful investment in the industry. Currently, Shipping (covering the container, dry bulk, product tanker and LNG sub-sectors) represents 1.25% of the portfolio. Global trade has declined as a percentage of GDP since 2010 caused by deglobalization, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical instability from the Russia-Ukraine war. This trend, coupled with the energy transition, is expected to constrain future supply and increase commodity price volatility, benefiting shipping by enabling cross-border trade.\nFurthermore, shipping is a significant emitter of CO2, accounting for about 3% of global emissions. Environmental regulations aim to reduce emissions, but uncertainty over future fuel technology deters investment in new ships, leading to a tighter supply. The industry\u2019s efficiency, measured by emissions per tonne-km, remains high compared to other transport modes. The shipping industry is at a pivotal juncture, with significant transformations driven by AI, the energy transition, and ESG considerations.\nAnother industry that Hosking Partners talks about is copper mining. Copper is often seen as a barometer for economic health and is crucial for the energy transition, including electric vehicles, power grids, and wind turbines. Wall Street banks are optimistic about copper prices, forecasting significant gains. Citi analysts suggest that prices could surge to over $15,000 per ton in the next 2-3 years if a strong economic recovery occurs, while their base case projects a rise to $12,000 per ton with modest demand growth through 2025 and 2026. Bank of America has also increased its 2024 copper price target to $9,321 from $8,625, citing tight mine supply and high demand driven by the energy transition as key factors.\nHowever, some experts are cautious. Colin Hamilton of BMO Capital Markets argues that commodity markets tend to self-correct, and if supply issues persist, demand may adjust, potentially leading to lower prices. Hamilton suggests that while high price targets might be temporarily achievable, adjustments in demand could follow. The market may see a modest surplus due to increased mined supply, which is projected to grow by 4-4.5%.\u00a0This is largely driven by new greenfield and brownfield projects. Despite the near-term surplus, long-term scarcity is anticipated as regulatory and political challenges in South America could impede the development of new mines.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL), provides a variety of platforms and services through its Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. Known globally for products like Google Search, YouTube, and Gmail, Alphabet\u2019s success is largely due to its dominance in the search engine market and lucrative deals with companies like Apple, making Google Search the default on many devices. Additionally, Alphabet is a significant player in the AI software industry, competing with major entities like Microsoft-backed OpenAI.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) experienced significant growth in Q2 2024, with a 15% year-over-year revenue increase and a 31% rise in diluted EPS. The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) grew nearly 29% YoY, strengthening its position in the cloud market. The company\u2019s first dividend and share buyback program further enhance its attractiveness. Despite a recent 14% drop in its stock price, it is valued at 20-25x FY2024 earnings, indicating a potential buying opportunity. Analysts have set a price target of $203.74, projecting a 25.03% upside as of August 16. Although regulatory challenges and AI competition pose risks, Alphabet\u2019s strong data capabilities and innovation provide resilience.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc.

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this company have returned -8.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.9% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 4.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.63 points to a change of +31.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.2%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $72.79 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.7%. The $292.25 billion and $325.79 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.9% and +11.5%, respectively.\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) ended the recent trading session at $162.85, demonstrating a -1.11% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.6%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.39%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.12%.\nHeading into today, shares of the internet search leader had lost 3.29% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.97% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.15% in that time.\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Alphabet in its upcoming release. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.83, showcasing a 18.06% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $72.79 billion, showing a 13.64% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $7.63 per share and a revenue of $296.53 billion, signifying shifts of +31.55% and +15.6%, respectively, from the last year.\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Alphabet. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To utilize this, we have created the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model that integrates these estimate changes and provides a functional rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.19% increase. Alphabet is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nLooking at its valuation, Alphabet is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 21.58. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 25.57 for its industry.\nWe can additionally observe that GOOGL currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.23. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. The average PEG ratio for the Internet - Services industry stood at 1.75 at the close of the market yesterday.\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 144, which puts it in the bottom 44% of all 250+ industries.\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nEnsure to harness Zacks.com to stay updated with all these stock-shifting metrics, among others, in the next trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Jefferies analysts maintain 'Buy' on Alphabet despite antitrust risks",
        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Investing.com - Jefferies analysts reaffirmed their \"Buy\" rating for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Sunday, despite ongoing antitrust concerns, following insights from a discussion with antitrust expert Glenn Manishin.\nAccording to Manishin, the likelihood of Alphabet facing a forced breakup or significant fines in its ongoing legal battles is minimal.\nManishin, a principal at ParadigmShift Law, brings a wealth of experience, having been counsel-of-record in landmark antitrust cases such as United States v. AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) and United States v. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\nHis insights provide valuable perspectives on the Department of Justice's (DOJ) antitrust case against Alphabet, particularly in regard to Google's ad tech platform and search business.\nAccording to Manishin, Alphabet is not expected to undergo a forced breakup or face major fines. Unlike the divestiture of AT&T's Bell Systems in 1982, such drastic measures are unlikely in this case.\nThe last forced divestiture was that of Standard Oil in 1911. Furthermore, the US Government lacks the authority to impose significant fines on antitrust violators, contrary to practices in other jurisdictions.\nThe antitrust case could take a long time to resolve, potentially spanning three to eight years. Manishin anticipates that the judge will take nine to eighteen months to propose remedies, after which Alphabet would likely appeal.\nThis appeal process would benefit from several factors, including rising AI competition, potential changes in administration, and historical legal theories that do not view capital as a barrier to entry.\nAlphabet's network effects are expected to play a crucial role in mitigating risks. Manishin draws a parallel to Microsoft's historical strategy of paying OEMs to preinstall Windows, leading to enduring network benefits even after such payments ceased.\nSimilarly, even if the judge bans payments from Alphabet to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to be the exclusive search provider, Alphabet's strong network effects could ensure it remains the search engine of choice, potentially leading to margin benefits.\nManishin posits that Google's advertising platform case, which is set to commence on September 9th in the Eastern District of Virginia, could have more significant financial implications than the current search-focused DOJ case.\nThe judge in this case might order behavioral remedies or even mandate a spin-off of the ad-tech business from the search business, thereby reducing Alphabet's dominance in the ad tech sector.\nStock Valuation and Outlook\nDespite the legal challenges, Jefferies analysts find Alphabet's current stock valuation attractive. Over the past month, Alphabet's stock has dropped 8%, compared to a 1% decline in the NASDAQ Composite (COMP).\nThe stock trades at an 11.6x forecasted CY25 enterprise value to EBITDA ratio, which is favorable compared to its 10-year near-term mean average of 12x.\nRelated Articles\nJefferies analysts maintain 'Buy' on Alphabet despite antitrust risks\nPilgrim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pride in $100 million settlement over chicken farmers' pay\nB.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 17 Latest AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks under hedge funds' radar.\nIt is no surprise that companies in the United States and China are leading the rest of the world when it comes to artificial intelligence. Conservative estimates about the impact of AI on the global economy, made by market experts at professional services firm PwC, reveal that AI-related gains, equal to close to $11 trillion, will account for nearly 70% of total global economic impact by 2030. In China, AI is expected to contribute to a nearly 26% boost to the GDP within the next six years, while this figure in the US will likely be 15%. AI no doubt represents the biggest commercial investment opportunity in this fast-paced world economy.\nSmart companies are seizing on this opportunity. According to market research firm IDC, investments in AI infrastructure will cross $30 billion this year and are projected to grow to $47 billion by 2028. This represents approximately 30% of the total global spending in AI. One of the most prominent AI use cases is in the customer service world. In this area, global businesses have spent more than $16 billion in 2024 so far. The impact of these investments in AI will be significant down the road. AI is likely to contribute to a $15 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030, up 14% from current levels.\nLike other sectors of the economy, Wall Street is no stranger to AI. The debut of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked the beginning of the AI revolution in the world of finance. Since then, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), sales of software, hardware, and services for AI systems have climbed rapidly and will top $400 billion in 2027. Financial sector spending is likely to double to nearly $100 billion in 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 30% \u2014 the fastest of five major industries. Hedge funds, often the pioneers of cutting-edge technology, are embracing generative AI as well.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. The firm has been one of the fastest in the tech world to integrate AI into the products it markets. For example, six of the most used Google applications on the internet, each of which has at least 2 billion monthly active users, already has Gemini functionality. Gemini is an AI-powered assistant that Google claims is the most advanced generative AI model in the consumer market. Generative AI models focus on the development of new content versus traditional AI models that analyze and interpret data. Gemini is also likely to be available on all Android devices, further improving reach.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is thus one of the best-positioned firms to capitalize on the AI boom, according to analysts at investment advisory Jefferies. Analyst Brent Thill has a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $220. In a recent note, he detailed that there was a bullish view on the ability of Gemini to access info across Gmail, Google calendar and more, supposing the users opt in.\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our list of the best AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. investors are anxiously awaiting a Google hardware event on Tuesday \u2014 banking on new AI features to help stop a selloff that\u2019s wiped out more than $360 billion in market value in just one month.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money\nBoston\u2019s Broke and Broken Transit System Hurts Downtown Recovery\nA Floating Island in Baltimore Raises Hope for a Waterfront Revival\nA Warehouse Store Promises Housing for South LA, in Bulk\nThe Cross-Continental Race Using Only Public Transit\nGoogle is unveiling one of the biggest redesigns of its Pixel phones in their nearly decade-long history at an event starting at 10 a.m. in Mountain View, California. While the devices are usually an afterthought for investors because of their small revenue contribution relative to Google\u2019s digital advertising business, expectations are high that new AI capabilities could demonstrate leadership in the highly competitive arena.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to get some solid information about the Google AI product to help turn around this period of profit taking,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, a senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder LLC. \u201cIt\u2019s very helpful for investors to hear news like this and generally most of the time it\u2019s positive news and helps the stock.\u201d\nA boost is much needed. Alphabet shares have fallen 15% from a high in mid-July. They\u2019ve come under pressure along with other megacaps amid concerns about slowing economic growth in the US and lofty valuations, while investors are increasingly worried that there\u2019s relatively little to show for heavy spending on AI. Alphabet shares fell after second-quarter capital spending came in higher than expected as the company strives to outmatch rivals in AI.\nOver the past year, the perception of Google\u2019s position in the race to deploy generative AI technologies has been critical to its stock performance.

In April, the stock rallied after unveiling updates to AI offerings for cloud customers.\nAt Tuesday\u2019s event, Alphabet is expected to show more on-device AI offerings, driven by native integration of its Gemini large language model for text, image and voice-level features, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cAdvantages for Google\u2019s Android in owning its foundational large language model are being highlighted by the delayed rollout of Apple Intelligence features, such as its integration with ChatGPT in version 18.1 of iOS,\u201d analyst Mandeep Singh wrote.\nAlphabet\u2019s recent selloff has left the stock hovering around the cheapest since March. It\u2019s priced at 19 times profits projected over the next 12 months, down from a high of nearly 24 times last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That\u2019s at a discount to the average multiple in the S&P 500, which sits around 20.5 times.

        "Title": "Here's Why Alphabet Deserves a Spot in Your Portfolio",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In a market where countless stocks are trading at unreal valuations or growing at lightning speed, investors may be tempted to load up on these types of stocks. While I'm a proponent of owning some of these names, a well-balanced portfolio isn't completely levered toward growth at all costs.\nThis is why I think there is room for companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) in a portfolio. While Alphabet participates in the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, it's not its primary business. I think Alphabet deserves a spot in every investor's portfolio, as the current business model should provide market-beating returns for years to come.\nFirst, let's look at what just a few percentage points of outperformance each year looks like. Say you invest $500 per month into the S&P 500, which has historically returned around 10% annually. After 30 years, you'll have $1.1 million. That's a great run, but if you can get 12% annual returns (which I think Alphabet can do), that number rises to $1.8 million -- a 56% increase.\nThat's a huge effect just by putting in a bit of effort to identify companies that can barely beat the market.\nAlphabet is a company that has done that consistently by being the market leader in internet search through its Google search engine. Google holds greater than a 90% market share in this space, and its dominance is undisputed. This is how Google makes the bulk of its money, selling advertising space on the billions of daily searches.\nHowever, a new challenger has some investors worried. OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is launching SearchGPT, a Google competitor. This may be one of Google's strongest competitors, but it would have to be unbelievably better to unseat Google from the minds of millions of daily users. It's a long road ahead and would occur over decades, not quarters.\nAs a result, I'm confident Google will maintain its dominance for years to come, which will allow it to continue producing year after year of market-beating growth.\nBut how will it do that?\nAt the end of the day, investors care about profits, not just sales. Although sales drive profits higher, there are other ways to grow profits.\nOne primary way is share repurchases. When a company buys back its own stock, it reduces the number of shares, so each existing shareholder gets more profit per share. Alphabet has been doing this for a long time and has meaningfully reduced its share count over the past five years.\nLast year, Alphabet reduced its shares by about 3%. This gives it a near-automatic 3% earnings per share (EPS) growth rate, which means revenue growth doesn't need to be as fast.\nAlphabet has also started paying a dividend, with its annual yield hovering around 0.5%. While that's not a huge amount, it barely scratches the surface of what it can pay. Over time, this payout will increase and further reduce the required sales growth needed to drive market-beating returns.\nShould its dividend grow to a 1% yield, Alphabet maintains a 3% per year share retirement rate, and if its margins stay steady, Alphabet would only need to grow revenue at a high single-digit pace to beat the market. With Wall Street analysts forecasting 13% and 11% revenue growth for this year and next, I'd say it's well on its way to beating the market.\nWhen you consider that you can buy Alphabet's stock at around 22 times forward earnings on par with the S&P 500's earnings valuation, the stock is perfectly priced for long-term investors.\nYour portfolio doesn't have to double each year to be a successful investor.

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet's (GOOG) Waymo said on Tuesday it had doubled its paid rides to 100,000 per week in just over three months as the autonomous ride-hailing firm expanded its areas of service and allowed more people to ride its robotaxis.\nWaymo's expansion comes just a month after Alphabet said it was planning a multi-year $5 billion investment in the company even as autonomous vehicle technology continues to face widespread skepticism, tight regulatory scrutiny and federal investigations.\nWaymo, which has about 700 vehicles in its fleet, is the only U.S. firm operating uncrewed robotaxis that collect fares. The company opened its service to everyone in San Francisco in June without joining a waitlist while expanding its operations in metro Phoenix. This month, Waymo extended services to the San Francisco Peninsula and to certain parts of Los Angeles.\n\"People still think of autonomous vehicles as the faraway future, but for more and more people they're now an everyday reality,\" Chief Product Officer Saswat Panigrahi said in a statement, adding that Waymo's expanded \"deliberately\" and by \"optimizing costs\".\nThat is critical as competition for Waymo is expected to intensify. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is expected to unveil the electric vehicle market leader's delayed plans for its robotaxi product in October.\nOthers in the race include General Motors' (GM) Cruise, which is finding its way back to U.S. roads with safety drivers after a major accident last year; Amazon's (AMZN) Zoox, which is expanding testing for its vehicles built without steering wheels and pedals; and China-based WeRide, which is seeking a $5 billion valuation from its New York IPO and got approval from California to conduct tests with passengers.\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Kim Coghill)\n"

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 10 Bullish Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against Jim Cramer's other bullish stock picks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed his enthusiasm for the current market, highlighting a significant historical perspective. He reminded viewers that 20 years ago, Google went public at $85 per share and closed its first day up 18%. While many traders were thrilled by this initial gain, looking back, it was a major missed opportunity. The stock has since delivered a 7,736% return, far exceeding the S&P 500\u2019s return of just over 600%. This example illustrates the potential wealth individual stocks can offer compared to broader indices, especially if you choose wisely.\n\"Twenty years ago today, Google went public at a split-unadjusted price of $85 per share. On its first day, the stock closed up 18%. Many traders, thrilled by this initial gain, took the profit. In retrospect, this was one of the greatest mistakes of all time. It has since delivered a 7,736% return, compared to the S&P 500's return of slightly more than 600% with dividends. This serves as a reminder of the wealth that individual stocks can generate compared to indices when you choose wisely. And I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s not that hard if you know how to research. So, I think it's time to reconsider the average approach, at least for today.\"\nCramer noted that, despite a strong recent performance\u2014with the Dow gaining 237 points, the S&P 500 up 0.97%, and the NASDAQ increasing by 1.39%\u2014the short-term market outlook is more complex. The market is currently on its longest winning streak since November of last year, with 93% of S&P 500 stocks showing gains.\nHowever, he cautioned that the market might be \"overbought,\" as indicated by the Market Edge oscillator, a tool Cramer has relied on since 1987. When the oscillator reaches plus five or higher, it signals that it might be time to sell. Conversely, readings of minus five or lower indicate oversold conditions, suggesting it's a good time to buy.\n\"Even though it was another good day for the markets. we need to consider both the short-term and long-term outlooks. The short-term setup isn\u2019t as favorable. We\u2019re currently on a significant winning streak, with the market having risen for straight days, the longest streak since November of last year. Impressively, 93% of the S&P 500 stocks are up. \"\nThis follows a Monday when the market dropped sharply due to the Yen carry trade imploding, which led to a wave of forced selling and subsequent panic.\n\"As I've often said, panic is not a strategy. Since that panic, the market has mostly been trending upward.\"\nJim Cramer has also expressed concern about the upcoming Justice Department case challenging the search engine giant's role in the advertising exchange market. This legal issue could have a significant negative impact on it, a company that has greatly benefited from this setup. A victory for the Justice Department could be even more damaging than the previous issue with Apple over default search engine payments, which contributed to its monopoly concerns.\nAccording to Cramer, the resilience of tech giants is evident, with strong recoveries even after short-term dips. (see 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\nJim Cramer emphasizes that investing in truly exceptional companies, rather than merely following market indices, usually leads to the best returns. Cramer advises investors to avoid panicking during market fluctuations and to maintain their focus on holding strong companies for long-term success.\n\"As we move forward, it's important to remember that investing in truly great companies, rather than just following the index, often yields the best returns. The substantial gain from Google over 20 years exemplifies this. Avoiding panic during market turbulence and sticking with strong companies is crucial for long-term success.\"\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we reviewed a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money and highlighted ten stocks that he is optimistic about. We also included information on hedge fund sentiment for each stock and ranked them based on how many hedge funds own each one, starting with the least owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 216\nOn the 20th anniversary of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s IPO, Jim Cramer reflected on the company's remarkable journey. Cramer had estimated Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s value at around $300 on its first day, a figure so high that it prompted questions from his lawyer. In hindsight, he admitted that $500 would have been a more accurate estimate, though he was being conservative.\n\"On this the 20th anniversary of the IPO, I want you to consider the saga of Google. I like the saga so much; it makes me happy. When it went public, it used a Dutch auction system which favored buyers over sellers. You got a driven price if you managed to snag a piece of it. I remember mentioning on air that I thought Google was worth about $300 that day, a price so high that our lawyer called me to ask how I came up with that number. I said I would have used $500 but was being conservative.\"\nSince its IPO, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has continually reinvented itself, growing its cloud business significantly under Thomas Kurian, who took over in 2019. Cramer praised Kurian\u2019s achievements, noting that Google Cloud is now on a $42 billion run rate. He also highlighted recent executive changes, including the appointment of a new CFO, which he views positively. Cramer noted that while Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been a tremendous performer\u2014delivering a 7,736% return since its IPO\u2014investors often struggle with short-term market fluctuations.\nHe compared this situation to recent market movements, such as\nNVIDIA Corporation\n(NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s strong performance despite broader market concerns. Cramer emphasized that individual stocks, rather than indices like the S&P 500, are the real drivers of wealth creation. He also advised maintaining positions in top-performing companies like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), despite short-term market volatility.\nArtisan Select Equity Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe top contributors to performance for the quarter were\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG), Lam Research and Elevance. Alphabet shares rose by 21% during the quarter, making it the largest contributor to our performance. The company reported excellent Q1 earnings, highlighting accelerating revenue growth, strong profitability and effective capital allocation. Alphabet\u2019s core search business is growing at a mid-teens rate\u2014the fastest growth rate in nearly two years. Importantly, its non-search businesses have reached significant scale, with its cloud and YouTube businesses expected to reach a combined run-rate of $100 billion by the end of 2024\nOverall GOOG ranks 2nd on our list of Jim Cramer's top bullish stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Affan Mir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Beginner Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other beginner stocks.\nWhile investing in the stock market carries risk, the US stock market is generally considered a safe place to invest. It has a long history of growth and has consistently recovered from downturns, including major recessions and financial crises.\nOver the last four to five years, the market has been hit by several unexpected downturns, due to a global pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, among other things, that crippled the global economy. However, the US broader market recovered swiftly and has been performing well since 2023. It is nearly 19% up year-to-date, as of August 23.\nNevertheless, it is still a complicated place for beginners and they should consider investing in shares of well-established companies with a history of stable performance and reliability. These stocks typically belong to large, financially sound companies that operate in diverse industries, such as technology, consumer goods, and healthcare.\nAdditionally, beginners can also look into index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track major market indices like the S&P 500. These options offer diversification, which reduces the risk associated with investing in individual stocks while still providing exposure to the broader market's potential gains. Investing in such well-established and diversified assets can help beginners build confidence and knowledge in the stock market. For such ETFs, you can check out our article on the best large-cap growth ETFs.\nOn August 16, Melissa Minkow, director of retail strategy at CI&T, discussed the latest trends in U.S. consumer spending in a CNBC interview. Despite concerns about a potential recession, Minkow believes we might have avoided one. She pointed out that although consumers may feel like they are in a recession, their spending habits show otherwise. They continue to spend, especially when presented with discounts. Retailers have adapted by offering more targeted promotions this year, which has helped maintain consumer spending despite previous challenges like the pandemic and supply chain issues.\nMinkow also noted that the effectiveness of promotions can vary across sectors. For example, quick-service restaurants like McDonald's and Starbucks haven\u2019t seen the same benefits from discounts as other retailers, partly because consumers may opt for more cost-effective alternatives like home-cooked meals. Additionally, brands that are already positioned as discount options might not see as much impact from promotions. However, retailers who offer significant discounts on desirable items can attract cost-conscious shoppers and increase sales volume, potentially offsetting the impact on profit margins.\nFor beginner investors in the stock market, the current retail sector dynamics offer both opportunities and challenges. The resilience of consumer spending, even in the face of economic uncertainty, suggests that certain sectors and companies could continue to perform well, especially those that effectively use promotions to drive sales. Retailers offering targeted discounts on popular items may attract more customers, boosting their sales volumes, which could lead to positive stock performance.\nHowever, beginner investors should also be cautious. Not all companies benefit equally from promotions, as seen with the restaurant and food segment, where discounts haven\u2019t significantly improved earnings. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific business models and market positioning of companies before investing.\nThe U.S. stocks have seen a significant surge over the last few quarters, which are mainly driven by strong economic data and optimism about a potential soft landing for the U.S. economy. However, experts remain cautious as we discussed in our best defensive stocks article.\nIn the article, we discussed the J.P. Morgan report that noted the market's heavy reliance on large, high-quality tech and AI companies, and it warned that maintaining this momentum could be challenging due to high valuations and potential market volatility. Here is an excerpt from the article:\n\u201cAccording to a July report by J.P Morgan, recent market trends have benefited large, high-quality companies, especially in tech and AI, which have resulted in high market concentration. However, maintaining this momentum in the second half of 2024 could be difficult due to high valuations and investor positioning. The report says that while U.S. market volatility is currently low, it could rise if conditions change.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used stock screeners to identify large to mega-cap stocks with a revenue compound annual growth rate of at least 5% over the last 10 years. The companies we chose are well-known, well-established, fundamentally strong, and some also pay regular dividends. We listed the companies in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter of 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\n10-year Revenue CAGR: 18.36%\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a California-based global technology conglomerate engaged in different sectors and offers a range of products, including internet technologies, advertising, hardware, and research and development. The company operates through three main segments, Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets.\nThe Google Services segment has a broad range of products, including Google Search, YouTube, Android, Chrome, Google Play, Google Maps, and Google Ads. This segment also features popular applications such as Gmail and Google Drive, which are designed to enhance productivity and connectivity for users.\nThe Google Cloud segment provides enterprise-grade cloud computing solutions, which allow businesses to develop, test, and deploy applications on an infrastructure. It includes Google Cloud Platform services, tools for data storage, machine learning, AI, and analytics.\nThe Other Bets segment focuses on healthcare and internet services. It includes Waymo, which is advancing autonomous driving technology, Verily, which is focused on life sciences; and Nest, known for its smart home innovations.\nAt a stake value of $35.3 billion, 216 hedge funds held positions in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the second quarter. As of Q2, Fisher Asset Management is the top shareholder in the company and has a position worth $8.856 billion.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a well-known name in the digital world and has made significant strides in both advertising and cloud computing. Google Cloud, while smaller compared to Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, has made progress over the past year, largely due to the rising interest in AI products. The introduction of the Gemini family of models has contributed to this growth, helping the company gain market share.\nIn the second quarter, Google Cloud saw a remarkable 29% increase in revenue and achieved a profit margin of 11%, a significant marker of its profitability. Forrester Research has recognized Google as a leader in AI infrastructure and large language models, which reinforces its position in this rapidly growing sector.\nCEO Sundar Pichai has highlighted that the company's AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions have already generated substantial revenue, with over 2 million developers using these tools. Pichai views AI as a major growth driver for the future. The company has embedded AI across its diverse range of products, including Maps, YouTube, Gmail, and Google Cloud, which is a sign of its commitment to integrating advanced technology into its offerings.\nAccording to Stat Counter, Google has dominance in the online search market as it controls around 90% of it. This strong position is supported by its expertise in search algorithms and AI. In the advertising sector, the company leads with six products, each boasting over 2 billion monthly users. This extensive user base enhances the company's ability to gather data and deliver targeted ads, which makes it a crucial partner for many brands.\nPichai has noted that generative AI enhancements are not only increasing the use of Google Search but also improving user satisfaction, especially among younger demographics. With the initial success of its AI initiatives, the company is ramping up its investments in this area, with plans to allocate nearly $50 billion in capital expenditures for 2024, reflecting a more than 50% increase from the previous year.\nPatient Capital Management stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best beginner stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against Guy Spier's other high conviction stock picks.\nGuy Spier\u2019s\u00a0Aquamarine Capital Management\u00a0is\u00a0a Zurich, Switzerland-based investment manager that employs the same long-term oriented, value investment approach as Warren Buffett, who Mr. Spier proudly considers himself a disciple of.\nSpier earned a degree in philosophy, politics, and economics from Oxford University in 1988 and followed that up with an MBA from Harvard Business School. Foollowing that, he spent several years working as a researcher and investor on Wall Street, including stints at Braxton Associates and Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, the latter of which inspired him to launch his own value investing fund in 1997.\nSpier is noteworthy in the investment world for his $650,100 lunch (alongside\u00a0Mohnish Pabrai) with Warren Buffett in 2007, which was purchased through a charity auction. Spier took several important lessons from that meeting, including the necessity of saying no, and ultimately wrote a book about his takeaways from that lunch and his broader investment journey entitled \u2018The Education of a Value Investor: My Transformative Quest for Wealth, Wisdom, and Enlightenment\u2019.\nMr. Spier makes all of his firm\u2019s investment decisions himself and is an even more ardent value investor than Buffett, holding on to many of his positions for several years without touching them. In the second quarter the fund added two small new positions to its 13F portfolio while otherwise leaving the rest of it untouched. Its 13F portfolio held $263 million worth of assets on June 30, 74% of which were invested in finance stocks.\nAquamarine\u2019s total return stands at 874% since inception through the end of 2023, or 9% annually, outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 717% returns during that period. Spier\u2019s fund hasn\u2019t been as successful in recent years however. It returned 18.7% last year, which underperformed the market, the sixth-straight year it\u2019s failed to top the market. 2000, 2002, and 2006 were three of the fund\u2019s strongest years, as it beat the market by more than 20%.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0is first up among Guy Spier\u2019s high conviction stock picks, with his fund owning an even 16,000 of the tech giant\u2019s class A shares. Aquamarine Capital bought the majority of its Alphabet stake in the fourth quarter of 2022 and has left it alone ever since. Alphabet is the most popular stock among hedge funds as well as a popular pick for other value investors like Donald Yacktman, whose firm owns 3.53 million class C shares as of June 30.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s latest quarterly results were solid, with revenue growing by 14% year-over-year to $84.7 billion, nearly 60% of which was courtesy search advertising. Operating margin rose 300 basis points to 32%, driving increased profitability (EPS rose to $1.89 from $1.44) even as Alphabet\u2019s capital expenditures nearly doubled to $13.2 billion during the quarter. The company is investing heavily in AI to try and stave off competitors like the AI-powered search engine SearchGPT, which threatens to jeopardize Google\u2019s highly lucrative monopoly over the search engine space.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy believes that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s aforementioned investents in AI are being underappreciated by the market, as the fund shared in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:MSFT).\nEven so, it is undeniable that the Google parent company has its moats and an excellent operational track record.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with ORCL.\nAs the company is far from bad, I believe this recent dip makes the stock even more attractive, which, if it maintains its prospects of growing by double digits a year, is very cheap.\nLooking at the forward price-earnings of the main Magnificent Seven companies, it is clear Alphabet stands out as the one with the lowest indicator. While the search machine is trading at 21 times its next 12 months' earnings, companies like Microsoft and Apple are already over 30, not to mention Amazon and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which add further distortion to this comparison. Even Meta (NASDAQ:META), which in recent history had the lowest multiples, has overtaken the tech giant.\nNote that although Alphabet has never stood out as a company that is traded with a rich multiple, in many periods it was much closer to the other companies, and only in recent months has this gap opened up.\nGOOGL Data by GuruFocus\nOf course, there is a reason for this. Even though the market often acts in a dysfunctional way, this would hardly happen without a plausible justification, especially for one of the world's largest companies. The main reason for the stock trading at this level, while maintaining an expectation of double-digit sales growth, is the threat to its main business, Google Search.\nIn the second quarter, the search tool accounted for 57% of the group's revenue, while other initiatives such as YouTube, Google Play and Google Cloud were closer to 10% each. Even with this dependence, credit must be given to Alphabet, which over the years has built up a complete and diversified business model.\nSource: App Economy Insights\nAccording to some bears, Google's search model could be disrupted or slowed down by large language models. Today, the most common thing when you want to go to a restaurant or have a question is to go to the search engine and type it in. One of the narratives suggests this could easily be replaced by a question to your chatbot, be it GPT Chat, Alexa or Siri. If, instead of searching, many people start using these other methods, search becomes less relevant and directly impacts the company's revenue.\nMy take tends toward skepticism. However long it takes for this narrative to materialize, instead of completely disrupting Google Search, it may only be something that will add obstacles, reducing growth rather than bringing about a stagnation or decrease in this line of revenue in the short and medium term. Artificial intelliegence will gradually become more popular, but to reach a considerable mass of the population that adopts it in their daily lives and replaces their habits of using Google search as a tool could take years.\nAs Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the world, even if this happens gradually, the company will be able to balance it with growth at other ends, whether in the cloud, through YouTube or a new line of revenue with Gemini. There is a range of options that bring an interesting vision and can help sustain this growth in the long run.\nIn many cases, investors tend to turn something simple into something complex. While this can sometimes be necessary, especially in technology segments that are very dynamic and the outlook changes all the time, overcomplicating something and getting carried away with the narrative is a very common mistake.\nTrying to look at it pragmatically, in a stick with the fundamentals analysis, Alphabet is still an excellent company. In the breakdown of revenue, you can see that search revenue and Google Play advanced by 14% year over year, YouTube by 13% and Google Cloud by 29%. Alphabet is far from a dying business. Even with this growth, the miss in YouTube ad revenue disappointed the market, which together with the higher capital expenditures, caused the stock to fall post-earnings.\nBut it does not stop there. As well as having a growth rank of 10 on the GF Score, its profitability rank is also solid at 10. Its financial strength is also very good with cash on hand of over $100 billion. In terms of profitability, it is worth highlighting a net margin of 26.70% as well as a return on invested capital of 32.50%, which shows a cash cow business model and assertive capital allocation.\nAlphabet's capital allocation is very good as it has robust cash on hand, which could eventually turn into another successful acquisition like YouTube, or reinvestment in the business that is transformed to at least remain relevant in industries like search, AI and cloud. In the second quarter, the company made capital expenditures of more than $13 billion to cope with a robust infrastructure that supports the advancement of Google Cloud, Google Search and other businesses through data centers, but it put pressure on free cash flow.\nFurthermore, although there is a risk that search will be affected, this is not a trend that seems likely to occur in the medium term. As already mentioned, this depends on the mass replacement and adoption of a new tool by the population. In the short and medium term, this technological evolution could bring greater assertiveness to ads and searches, boosting this market as a positive trend.\nWhen it comes to competition, although Google has recently lost ground to Bing (Microsoft's search engine), Alphabet still has a virtual monopoly, with more than 80% of the search market according to Statista.\nSource: Statista\nIn this way, the future for search is partly cloudy, but it does not seem so uncertain that it can be labeled a dying business.\nIn addition to the multiples, which became even more attractive after the recent dip, other methods reinforce that Alphabet's stock is at a level that will remunerate shareholders well. If we run a reverse discounted cash flow model using earnings per share, projecting growth of 15% per year for the next 10 years and 10% for the following decade, we find the current share price by discounting at a rate of 12%. In other words, if the company manages to achieve greater growth than this, the annual return for the shareholder would be above 12%, making the stock a real compounder.\nThis becomes even more interesting when we look at the last five years, where the earnings per share compound annual growth rate has been 25.90%. Although the company does not need to maintain this level consistently, it is possible that positive surprises could happen along the way so that EPS growth could exceed the projected 10% to 15% per year.\nIf we use more reasonable assumptions to try to find a fair price, it is still possible to find an interesting upside. With 18% in the first 10 years and 8% in the last 10, discounting by 11% (still a high and restrictive figure for a company of such quality), we would have a fair value of $212 per share, equivalent to an upside of 21%. I used EPS instead of free cash flow because of the recent history of high capex, which would negatively bias the reverse DCF model.\nAccording to the GF Value Line, the stock should be worth around $155, which currently qualifies it as fairly valued, showing that although Alphabet is much cheaper than its tech peers, it's still not a huge bargain.\nAlphabet still has relevant moats and is not a dying business. For this reason, even though there is a certain cloudiness to some parts of its business model, the discrepancy between the premium for companies like Apple and Microsoft seems to have become very large, while there is a discount on the Google parent's shares that makes it more attractive, especially after this dip.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are very different companies, but they are the top three players in the fast-growing cloud computing industry.\nThey offer hundreds of cloud services to businesses, from simple data storage to complex software development tools. More recently, they have invested heavily in new data centers filled with powerful graphics processors (GPUs) from the likes of Nvidia, and they rent the computing power to artificial intelligence (AI) developers. This could be one of the most valuable opportunities in the history of the cloud industry.\nMicrosoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are locked in a fierce battle for AI market share. DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN), on the other hand, has carved out a lucrative niche by only serving small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs), which are often overlooked by its trillion-dollar competitors. DigitalOcean stock looks like a great value, and here's why investors might want to buy it right now.\nThe cloud leaders typically focus on serving large organizations because they have the highest budgets, whereas SMBs receive less attention. DigitalOcean targets those customers exclusively, whether they are in the start-up phase or they have up to 500 employees.\nDigitalOcean provides them with highly personalized service, clear and transparent pricing, and cloud tools that are simple to deploy, because the company knows most of its customers can't afford in-house technical teams.\nDigitalOcean is now using that blueprint to deliver affordable AI solutions to customers. Right now, cloud leaders let their largest customers access tens of thousands of GPUs worth of computing capacity, which means developers with significant financial resources are building the most advanced AI models. Smaller companies simply can't compete.\nDigitalOcean recently announced it will allow its customers to access small numbers of AI GPUs (typically between one and eight), including Nvidia's flagship H100, to integrate AI into their workflows at a scale that suits them. CEO Paddy Srinivasan says this fractional on-demand access to GPUs is a first of its kind for the industry, and it helps democratize access to AI.\nThe company will also open a new state-of-the-art data center in Atlanta in early 2025 that will expand its AI compute capacity. It adds to the capacity DigitalOcean acquired when it bought Paperspace last year, which is a specialist in delivering AI data center infrastructure at affordable rates.\nIn fact, Paperspace is up to 70% cheaper than cloud leaders like Microsoft Azure when it comes to AI compute capacity, because it offers per-second billing to reduce wastage, and it doesn't lock customers into contracts. Plus, it has a leaner cost structure because it offers a narrow set of services, and it passes those savings on to the customer.\nDigitalOcean generated a record $192.5 million in revenue during the second quarter of 2024 (ended June 30), which was a 13% increase from the year-ago period. It marked the second consecutive quarterly growth acceleration.\nThe company was regularly growing its top line by more than 30% each quarter just two years ago, so it has slowed considerably overall. One reason is that DigitalOcean is currently slashing costs in order to boost its profitability. During Q2, the company had total operating expenses of $95 million, which was an 8.5% reduction from the year-ago period.\nThat resulted in $19.1 million in net income, a whopping 2,777% increase.\nThe fact DigitalOcean managed to accelerate its revenue growth while cutting costs and generating a healthy profit really speaks to the organic demand for its cloud services.\nPlus, here's something investors should keep an eye on in the coming quarters. DigitalOcean said its revenue attributable to AI, specifically, soared by a staggering 200% year over year in Q2. The company didn't disclose how much revenue it actually generated from its AI services (including Paperspace), so we can assume that growth was from a very low baseline number -- but it still signals surging demand.\nAccording to an estimate by Grand View Research, the cloud industry overall will be worth around $730 billion this year. The SMB segment alone could be worth $114 billion according to DigitalOcean, but the company expects it to grow by 23% annually going forward compared to just 21.2% for the cloud industry overall.\nDigitalOcean's strategy to deliver affordable AI infrastructure and services could add a new dimension to that opportunity, because it's penetrating a brand new market that has been underserved by other providers. Global consulting firm PwC thinks AI will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, so it's easily the largest financial opportunity DigitalOcean has faced to date.\nDigitalOcean stock is currently trading 75% below its all-time high that was set during the tech frenzy in 2021. It was overvalued back then with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of around 30, but the company has grown its revenue consistently ever since, and its P/S ratio now stands at just 4.1.\nThat's more than a 50% discount to its average P/S ratio of 8.8 going back to when the company came public in 2021:\nSimply put, DigitalOcean stock looks like a good value right now. Combine that with the company's accelerating revenue growth, surging profitability, and enormous opportunities in the cloud and AI industries, and investors could do well to start buying.\nBefore you buy stock in DigitalOcean, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and DigitalOcean wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Umar Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Big Data Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other big data stocks.\nThe global big data market is on a rapid growth trajectory, projected to reach $103 billion by 2027, more than doubling its size from 2018. This explosive growth is driven by the increasing reliance on data to inform business decisions, optimize operations, and unlock new revenue streams. According to Statista, the software segment, in particular, is poised to dominate, accounting for 45% of the market by 2027. Big data, characterized by its massive volume, high velocity, and wide variety, presents both opportunities and challenges. Traditional data processing tools struggle to handle the scale and complexity of modern data sets, which have been expanding rapidly due to the surge in mobile data traffic, cloud computing, and the integration of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). These factors have contributed to the rise of big data as a critical asset for businesses across industries. As the data landscape evolves, advanced analytics tools such as predictive analytics and data mining have become essential for extracting valuable insights from vast datasets.\nThe rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a surge in connected devices, generating enormous amounts of data that necessitate advanced big data solutions for effective processing and analysis. Cloud computing enhances the big data market by offering scalable and cost-efficient storage and processing capabilities, enabling businesses to handle large data volumes with ease. Technological advancements in big data are continually enhancing the management and analysis of vast datasets, making these processes more accessible and practical. This progress supports the growing trend of data-driven decision-making, where companies increasingly rely on data insights to make informed choices, optimize operations, and secure a competitive edge. Additionally, big data analytics helps organizations uncover hidden patterns and customer trends, fostering innovation and allowing for the development of products and services that adapt to evolving market demands, underscoring the vital role of big data in today\u2019s competitive landscape.\nInvestment in big data technologies is also driven by stringent data privacy and security regulations. Compliance with laws like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the U.S. is becoming mandatory for businesses. These regulations require robust data handling practices, pushing companies to implement advanced big data solutions that ensure data privacy and security. Enhanced measures such as secure storage and data privacy protocols build trust with consumers and stakeholders. Moreover, the need for effective data governance frameworks is accelerating the adoption of sophisticated big data technologies. These solutions facilitate comprehensive data management, including tracking data lineage, maintaining data integrity, and conducting regular audits. Emphasis is placed on integrating encryption, anonymization, and real-time monitoring tools to prevent data breaches and unauthorized access. Continuous investment in big data technologies is crucial for businesses to meet evolving compliance requirements, thereby driving the market\u2019s growth.\nAccording to a report by Verified Market Reserach, North America is projected to remain a leader in the big data market, driven by key industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In the financial sector, Big Data analytics plays a crucial role for banks, investment firms, and insurance companies by providing deeper insights into customer behavior, detecting fraudulent activities, and evaluating risk. By analyzing extensive data sets, including transaction histories, market trends, and customer demographics, financial institutions can uncover patterns and anomalies that aid in making informed decisions and managing risks. Predictive analytics models further enhance market trend forecasts, optimize investment strategies, and improve portfolio management, contributing to greater profitability and competitive edge in the financial sector.\nIn healthcare, Big Data analytics significantly improves patient care, reduces costs, and advances medical research. Healthcare providers use Big Data to analyze electronic health records (EHRs), medical imaging, and genomic data to tailor treatment plans, diagnose diseases with greater precision, and predict patient outcomes. Population health analytics also helps healthcare organizations identify high-risk groups, allocate resources more effectively, and implement preventive measures. Additionally, the integration of big data into healthcare systems supports real-time monitoring of patient health metrics, allowing for timely interventions and better overall outcomes. Pharmaceutical companies benefit from big data by accelerating drug discovery, refining clinical trials, and creating personalized medicines, driving innovation and progress in medical science.\nWith such a robust outlook for the big data market, investors are keenly eyeing companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. In this article, we will explore the best big data stocks to buy now, focusing on companies that are well-positioned to capitalize on the immense growth opportunities within this dynamic sector.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw strong growth in Q2 2024, with a 15% YoY revenue increase and a 31% rise in diluted EPS. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) grew nearly 29% YoY, enhancing its competitive edge in the cloud market. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) first dividend and share buyback program also boost its appeal. Despite a recent 14% stock drop, it\u2019s valued at 20-25x FY2024 earnings, suggesting a buying opportunity. Analysts have set a price target of $203.74, reflecting an anticipated upside of 25.03% as of August 16. While risks include regulatory challenges and AI competition, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) strong data capabilities and innovation offer resilience.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) forward dividend yield is 0.49%, with an annual payout of $0.80 and a payout ratio of 2.87%. The company has announced a dividend of $0.20, with the ex-dividend date set for September 9, and the payout date scheduled for September 16. Shareholders must be on record by September 9, to receive the dividend.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 5th on our list of the best big data stock to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

Shares of Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) fell 2.3% on Aug. 14, the first trading session following the Justice Department\u2019s announcement, while the S&P 500 SPX rose 0.3%.

The publicly traded companies created from this breakup \u2014 the seven so-called Baby Bells \u2014 outperformed the U.S. stock market for years.\nThough it\u2019s hard for most of us today to imagine, AT&T (the iconic \u201cMa Bell\u201d) at that time played as central a role in the U.S. economy as Google does today. According to a 1993 New Yorker article by James Stewart (the emeritus Columbia Journalism School professor), AT&T\u2019s chairman at that time characterized the Justice Department\u2019s proposal as a \u201cnational catastrophe\u201d that the company would \u201cfight to the death.\u201d\nWhat actually happened is telling when the share performance of AT&T and the Baby Bells post-breakup is compared to the performance of IBM IBM shares.\nThe Justice Department in the 1970s had attempted to split up IBM but failed. The government dropped its case against IBM on the same day in the early 1980s in which it announced the breakup of AT&T. Yet IBM\u2019s stock over the subsequent one-, five- and 10-year periods not only lagged the market but hugely underperformed AT&T and its spinoffs, as the chart below shows.\nAs Stewart wrote in his 1993 retrospective about AT&T and IBM: \u201cNearly everyone in the computer industry agrees that, following its antitrust victory, IBM complacently retreated into the mainframe world it dominated \u2014 a strategy that was rewarding in the short term but has now proved disastrous.\u201d\nTo be sure, AT&T\u2019s post-split success constitutes a sample of just one, making it impossible to draw robust statistical conclusions. But it nonetheless is a powerful reminder that our initial reactions can be completely wrong.\n\u201cWe were forced by the divestiture to make changes that probably were good for us,\u201d said Robert Allen, who became AT&T\u2019s chief executive in 1988. \u201cWe went through some tough years, but it paid off. We may have been more fortunate than IBM in that change was forced on us.\u201d\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

        "Text": "If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) we really liked what we saw.\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Alphabet:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.30 = US$102b \u00f7 (US$415b - US$78b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nTherefore, Alphabet has an ROCE of 30%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 6.6%.\n View our latest analysis for Alphabet \nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Alphabet compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Alphabet  for free.\nAlphabet is displaying some positive trends. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 30%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 53% more capital is being employed now too. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\nTo sum it up, Alphabet has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And a remarkable 165% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\nWhile Alphabet looks impressive, no company is worth an infinite price. The  intrinsic value infographic for GOOGL helps visualize whether it is currently trading for a fair price.\nAlphabet is not the only stock earning high returns.

It also claimed that many AI use cases are \u201cnever going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.\u201d The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver \u201cvalue commensurate with the hype\u201d.\nThe $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are \u201cfew real uses\u201d of AI other than \u201csummarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding\u201d.\nElliott Management said in its letter that it stayed away from \u201cbubble\u201d stocks included in the Magnificicient Seven group.\nElliott Management last year posted a modest gain of 4.7%. However, it has a record of no down years since the financial crisis in 2008. Since its inception in 1977, the fund has reported just two down years, a feat hard to match in the hedge fund industry.\nWhile Elliott calling mega-cap AI stocks a bubble is a major development, it\u2019s certainly not a surprise. Many investors and market experts have been warning about the hype around major AI stocks.\nHere is what Insider Monkey\u2019s founder and Research Director Inan Dogan said about Elliott Management\u2019s latest thoughts on AI stocks:\n\u201cI have been saying that NVDA\u2019s market cap assumes that the company will make around $150 billion in profits perpetually which is crazy. Elliott is saying the same thing and it is becoming news! Investors don\u2019t know how to bet on the AI revolution, so the only visible companies that they think will benefit are semiconductor and cloud companies. That\u2019s why they have been piling into NVDA. It doesn\u2019t mean that other tech companies are in a bubble territory. In contrast, if Elliott is right that other megacaps are overspending on NVDA chips right now, this implies that their earnings are understated and they are actually much more profitable and cheaper than Elliott thinks. That\u2019s why NVDA and cloud companies are in different categories. NVDA could be in bubble territory but I am not sure other megacaps in the Magnificient Seven group are in a bubble.\u201d\nFor this article, we analyzed the top AI stocks in the Mag. 7 group which according to Paul Singer are in a bubble. We also talked about three AI/tech stocks that were in Singer\u2019s portfolio, as of the end of the first quarter of this year. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nGOOG is an important part of the Mag. 7 group of stocks which Singer believes are in a bubble.\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares slipped recently following reports that OpenAI is working on a web search product called SearchGPT. Before that, the stock fell following earnings despite posting strong numbers. Revenue in the second quarter jumped 14% year over year driven by search and Cloud. At a forward P/E of 22, analysts believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0continues to be one of the cheapest AI stocks in the market as its valuation remains depressed amid fears caused by an overreaction.\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels. \u00a0With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market.\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet\u2019s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts\u2019 forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) \u00a0is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\nConventum \u2013 Alluvium Global Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG), ie Google / YouTube, returned 20.8%. Although management reported good news \u2013 solid quarterly results, the expectation of margin expansion throughout 2024, as well as a maiden dividend (to add to its share repurchases) \u2013 we suspect the share price bounce was as much related to AI euphoria as it was to that positive news. From our perspective, the figures were largely as expected and there was no cause for us to change our assumptions nor estimates. Clearly Alphabet now trades at a larger premium to our valuation, but given the conservativeness of that valuation, in our view the premium is still not so much as to warrant selling. It represents 5.3% of the Fund.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Billionaire Paul Singer Says Stay Away from These 7 AI Bubble Stocks; 3 Tech Stocks He\u2019s Buying. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Better Tech Stock: Microsoft vs. Alphabet",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech stocks haven't had it easy over the last month as Wall Street has grown weary of the short-term potential of sectors like artificial intelligence (AI) and chips. As a result, the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite has dipped around 10% since early July.\nHowever, it's hard to overlook the industry's long-term growth history. The same index climbed 285% over the last decade, outperforming the S&P 500's 178% rise. Tech remains a compelling market to invest in and hold for many years, since it's driven by innovative companies that have ceaselessly pushed the envelope. As a result, a recent sell-off presents an exciting investment opportunity, with many stocks trading at better values.\nTwo attractive options are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). These companies dominate their respective tech areas, exposing investors to some of the fastest-growing industries.\nSo, let's examine these companies more closely and determine whether Microsoft or Alphabet is the better buy.\nMicrosoft's share price dipped 11% over the last 30 days, brought down by an overall cooldown in tech and mixed earnings.\nThe company reported its fourth quarter of 2024 earnings on July 30, revealing a 15% year-over-year rise in revenue, beating Wall Street expectations by about $260 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share (EPS) of $2.95 came in $0.02 higher than anticipated. Microsoft's earnings were overall positive, with all three of its main segments delivering double-digit revenue gains and operating income popping 15% year over year.\nHowever, an AI-focused Wall Street was let down by the company's intelligent-cloud segment, which posted revenue of $28.5 billion, $200 million shy of analysts' forecasts.\nYet, it wasn't all bad news for Microsoft's cloud division. The segment matched its biggest rival in cloud growth for the quarter, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) also posting a revenue increase of 19% year over year. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Azure and other cloud-services sales rose 29% in the quarter.\nThe main takeaway from Microsoft's latest quarter is the long-term reliability of its business. The company's development has always been more of a slow burn rather than an all-at-once expansion. It's seen its stock rise 408% over the last 10 years. As a result, its stock remains a compelling buy for patient investors.\nAlphabet is another company that has suffered a stock slip, falling 10% in the last month. Like Microsoft, the company had a generally positive quarter but missed analysts' forecasts on one point.\nThe Google company was among the first to release new earnings, posting its Q2 2024 results on July 23. The quarter saw revenue increase by 14% year over year, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $450 million as EPS beat by $0.04. Alphabet's Google Cloud segment beat expectations and its competitors, delivering a 29% spike in revenue. The growth was promising as the company works to catch Microsoft and Amazon in the space by expanding its AI offerings.\nQ2 2024 earnings were positive but missed on YouTube ad revenue. Sales for the segment hit $8.66 billion against expectations of $8.93 billion. However, total Google advertising remains a lucrative division, with revenue increasing by 11% year over year thanks to considerable gains from Search.\nAlphabet has grown into a tech behemoth in its 25 years of business, responsible for the popularity of multiple leading brands, including YouTube, Google, Android, and Chrome. Despite recent declines, its potent position in tech has seen its stock rise 90% over the last five years alongside triple-digit earnings growth.\nMicrosoft and Alphabet are easily compared businesses. They are each active in cloud computing, productivity software, AI, and digital advertising. Meanwhile, they both boast a spot in the world's top-five most-valuable companies by market cap, illustrating their reliability as long-term growth stocks. Microsoft's market cap topped $3 trillion this year, while Alphabet's is just above $2 trillion.\nEither of these companies' stocks would likely prove to be assets if held over many years. As a result, it's worth comparing their valuations to make a more informed decision about which is the better buy.\nThis chart shows Alphabet's shares are trading at a significantly better value than Microsoft's, with a far lower price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. Additionally, Alphabet's P/E and P/S are below their 10-year averages, while Microsoft's are higher for both metrics.\nIn addition to a consistently expanding business and a solid role in tech, Alphabet is the better stock to buy right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $643,212!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Among The Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors",
        "Author": "  Fatima Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other American stocks.\nHistorically, September is considered to be the worst month for stocks. The S&P 500 index has generally averaged a decline in the month of September for decades, which has resulted in many financial news reporters, such as the Wall Street Journal, dubbing September as a weak month for US stocks. So with August coming to an end, many investors in the US and abroad may be wondering whether now is a good time to pick up US stocks for their portfolios.\nWhile history can often be an accurate indicator of stock performance, this is not always the case. This year may very well be an outlier in the historical trend outlined above, seeing as many financial analysts are expecting the US Federal Reserve to move ahead with a rate cut this September. CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on August 21 highlighted that according to the Fed's recent meeting minutes, it is quite probable that we will be seeing a rate cut this September, which will probably result in stock prices rising and the markets performing better. This is because when a rate cut is announced, consumers and businesses tend to increase their spending and investment, which has a direct and positive impact on stock prices, causing them to rise. As such, if we do see a rate cut next month, investors may actually benefit from investing in American stocks.\nOn August 22, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss the status of the US markets at present. Here's what he had to say:\n\"The FMOC minutes that came out yesterday showed the Fed staff saying this is a strong labor market, while that jobs report that came out Friday and the revisions that just came out show a lot of jobs disappearing. It's not a stronger market, and I think it gives more ammunition for the Fed to start a cutting cycle, and that's gonna give a lot of life to the economy and to the markets. Especially cyclical stocks and small-cap stocks.\"\nAccording to Lee, investors looking to buy into US equities right now would benefit greatly from a rate cut if it does come about in September. A major beneficiary of such a cut would actually be the tech sector. In this regard, Lee said the following:\n\"I think tech is still in a good place because of AI, and NVIDIA should reinforce that. It's not a demanding multiple, maybe 28x forward earnings, which is, for the best, one of the most important companies in the world, not a high multiple. So, if tech is in a good place, and then we get fed cuts, I think it allows the whole overall market to expand.\"\nConsidering the above, US markets may actually be a good place to invest for foreign investors at present, and within these markets, tech may be a good place to start. This is why we've compiled a list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors, comprising most tech companies. Our list includes some of the best American tech stocks to buy, alongside some of the top US stocks for foreigners.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nWe selected the most popular American stocks among major hedge funds to compile our list, by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter of 2024. These companies are considered to be the best US stocks to invest in today according to major institutional investors, and should thus be considered by foreign investors looking to buy into American equities.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is yet another big tech name on our list. One of the main reasons its being added to this list is because of its current position as a leader in the AI space and its potential to retain this position.\nIn the first half of 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) delivered exceptional results with revenue growth at 14%. The primary reasons for this growth included not only the increasing adoption of AI automation tools but also the fact that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) occupies a dominant position in the digital advertising market. The company is being bought up by investors considering its numerous milestones in AI product development as well. For instance, at Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) annual developer conference this May, the company unveiled its \"AI Overviews,\" which are AI-powered summary responses for queries. This represents an immense step forward in AI integration within Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Search business, which is its key revenue growth catalyst, and is one of the many reasons why investors are purchasing Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stocks today.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was found in the portfolios of 216 hedge funds in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $35.3 billion.\nHere's what Pershing Square Holdings said about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its first-half 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, delivered stellar business results in the first half of 2024. Revenues grew 14% powered by Google\u2019s dominant position in the fast-growing digital advertising market as well as certain company-specific tailwinds including the increasing adoption of AI automation tools by advertisers and YouTube\u2019s continued success in the Connected TV Medium. Strong revenue growth coupled with cost control initiatives and stable staffing levels (headcount has remained flat year-to-date), resulted in strong operating leverage. Operating profit margins expanded approximately 340 basis points, excluding one-time severance and real estate charges. In the second quarter, the company\u2019s Cloud segment outpaced its major competitors with 29% revenue growth and achieved 11% profit margins, after first reaching profitability just 18 months ago.\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Tuesday, August 13, 2024The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) and QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM), as well as a micro-cap stock Flanigan's Enterprises, Inc. (BDL). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Alphabet shares have been hit hard in the recent market turmoil, with the stock lagging the Mag 7 group as well as the Zacks Tech sector and the S&P 500 index since mid-July 2024. The immediate catalyst for the sell-off was Alphabet's July 23rd Q2 earnings report when it beat on the top- and bottom-lines but failed to satisfy investors with its ever-rising capex spending levels. \nThe Zacks analyst sees the market's capex fixation as over-done and strongly argues that Alphabet's aggressive spending plans are essential to its status as leader in the coming AI world. \nThe company remains leader in the search space and AI investments are critical to it sustaining that lead. \nWell-performing Google Cloud remains the key catalyst. Expanding data centers and growing generative AI capabilities remain major positives for cloud business. Also, integration of generative AI into the company\u2019s search engine is expected to sustain its dominance in the search market.\u00a0Strong efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives. Deepening focus on wearables category and autonomous driving space, is a plus. However, sluggishness in the company\u2019s Network advertisement business is a concern. Growing litigation issues and increasing expenses are headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)Shares of AbbVie have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+22.7% vs. +21.1%). The company has successfully navigated Humira's loss of exclusivity by launching two other successful new immunology medicines, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. \u00a0Skyrizi and Rinvoq are performing extremely well, bolstered by approvals in new indications, which should support top-line growth in the next few years AbbVie has several early/mid-stage candidates that have potential to drive long-term growth.\u00a0 Boosted by its new product launches, AbbVie expects to return to robust revenue growth in 2025.\u00a0However, the company faces several near-term headwinds like Humira\u2019s biosimilar erosion, increasing competitive pressure on Imbruvica and slow market growth trend for fillers in the United States and China.(You can read the full research report on AbbVie here >>>)QUALCOMM\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry over the past year (+42.8% vs. +40.0%). The company reported strong third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, with the bottom and top lines beating the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven by healthy demand trends in Android handsets and record automotive revenues.\u00a0The Snapdragon X Series Platform integrated with Qualcomm AI Hub is witnessing significant market traction among leading global PC manufacturers. The company is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor firm for the intelligent edge and has offered a bullish guidance for the fourth quarter.\u00a0However, inventory corrections by clients are impeding sales in the IoT business. Increasing competition in the mobile phone chipset market is likely to strain margin. Rising geopolitical instability and high debt obligation remain concerns.(You can read the full research report on QUALCOMM here >>>)Shares of Flanigan's have declined -0.3% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry\u2019s decline of -7.2%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $47.73 million maintains a strong revenue growth, effective cost management, positive cash flow and a solid financial position. New store openings and operational improvements, like NetSuite, bode well.\u00a0Yet, Flanigan's net income fell 18.6% in first-quarter 2024 despite a 9.7% revenue uptick, highlighting rising costs and potential inefficiencies. Operating expenses rose 10.4%, driven by higher payroll, consultant fees, and food costs, eroding profit margins. High long-term debt poses a financial risk, especially if interest rates rise.\u00a0Franchise-related revenues fell 8.5%, indicating possible operational issues. Declining gross profit margins for restaurant and package store sales signal higher costs without matching price increases. Competitive pressures, economic sensitivity and substantial lease obligations also challenge profitability.(You can read the full research report on Flanigan\u2019s here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include BlackRock, Inc.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Famous Analyst Says You Should Buy the Dip on These AI Stocks.\u00a0Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nGene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said in a latest interview with CNBC that the key reason behind the latest decline in tech stocks was major companies projecting high CapEx and giving no updates on AI monetization. Munster, however, thinks AI spending is necessary for these companies to reap rewards in the future. Munster referred to a latest interview of Mark Zuckerberg in which he said if his company does not keep spending on AI it may miss the biggest opportunity in the next 10-15 years. Munster said Zuckerberg believes this AI spending \u201ccannot slow down.\u201d\n\u201cI am most optimistic because that CapEX number, if you\u2019re gonna boil it down to one point, it\u2019s gonna be higher for longer and it\u2019s good for AI.\u201d\nAsked whether investors should stick with mega-cap AI stocks or move on to smaller companies that could benefit from this AI spending, Munster said that depends on to what degree you believe in the transformative power of AI.\n\u201cIf you are in my camp.. which I think it (AI) will be more transformative than the internet, then small companies and the big companies are going to participate.\u201d\nMunster thinks the AI-led bull market could last for 3-5 years before ending in what he called a \u201cspectacular bubble burst.\u201d\nFor this article we picked the AI stocks Gene Munster and his firm Deepwater Asset Management hold, according to the disclosures on CNBC.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nGene Munster in his latest interview reiterated his bullish take on Alphabet, saying the company is best positioned for AI monetization thanks to the huge \u201cdistribution\u201d advantage due to billions of users of its products.\nMunster also said recently that Alphabet is going to win the \u201cAI arms race.\u201d While talking to CNBC, the analyst said that Google search business is \u201cintact, no need to worry.\u201d Munster\u2019s thesis is based on his in-depth testing of several large language models and chatbots including Google\u2019s Gemini. Munster also thinks other chatbots do not offer a strong imperative for users to switch from Google search as of yet.\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives in a fresh note named Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) as one of the stocks that can benefit from the AI boom.\nAccording to a latest UBS report, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls in all three layers of the AI value chain \u2013 enabling, intelligence and application layer. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an AI enabling player because of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform, while Gemini makes it a key player in the intelligence layer. On the application layer, UBS believes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has an edge with its Duet AI assistant and advertising. All these catalysts make Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) a company that could benefit from the $1.2 trillion AI opportunity by 2027, UBS said.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the company is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note-taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrated with other Google apps.

The company continues to introduce new search pathways with advanced models and algorithms that are 100 times more efficient than they were 18 months ago. Disruption risks to core search from generative AI have not completely abated, but Alphabet\u2019s technical prowess and historical investments in leading technologies are becoming more apparent.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Famous Analyst Says You Should Buy the Dip on These AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Alphabet's Google said on Wednesday it has updated Gemini's AI image-creation model and would roll out the generation of visuals of people in the coming days, after months-long pause of the capability.\nIn February, Google had paused its AI tool that creates images of people, following inaccuracies in some historical depictions generated by the model.\nThe issues, where the AI model returned historical images which were sometimes inaccurate, drew flak from users.\nThe company said it has worked to improve the product, adhere to \"product principles\" and simulated situations to find weaknesses.\nThe feature will be made available first to paid users of the Gemini AI chatbot, starting in English and later roll out the model to bring more users and languages.\nGoogle said it has improved the Imagen 3 model to create better images of people but it would not generate images of specific people, children or graphic content.\nOpenAI's Dall-E, Microsoft's CoPilot and recently xAI's Grok are among other AI chatbots that can now generate images.\nThe search engine giant also said over the coming days, subscribers to Gemini Advanced, Business and Enterprise would have access to chatting with \"Gems\" or chatbots customized for specific purposes.\nUsers can write specific instructions for particular purposes and create a Gem, saving them time from rewriting prompts for repetitive use cases.\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)\n"

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): Among Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs' Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks: Top 20 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against Goldman Sachs' other hedge fund stock picks.\nThe close of August has marked a highly awaited paradigm shift on Wall Street that investors have been wishing for months. This shift comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally admitted that the time for interest rate cuts had come. Investors rejoiced and the flagship S&P index gained 1.15% while the Dow's blue chip stock index added 1.14% to its value.\nBefore the Fed chair's remarks, investment bank Goldman Sachs had already taken a detailed look at the implications of interest rate cuts on the stock market. In a podcast, the bank's trading strategy head Josh Schiffrin started by explaining that the prospect of the Fed reducing rates was linked \"very closely to the performance of short-term bonds.\" He however added that it's \"really been bonds that have been responsive, where the story has been quite clear,\" pointing out that \"the stock market has been range bound and choppy with a fair amount of rotation between different sectors\" which leads to index level moves being \"muted.\" This makes sense when we consider the Dow and S&P's movements following Powell's latest comments, as the one percentage point gain for each indicated that investors were well prepared for rate cuts even before the Fed Chair took the stand.\nSpeaking of the flagship S&P index, GS' head of American Equity Sales Trading John Flood shared some insights at the June close. Starting off by highlighting the drives of the index's performance during the first half of the year, Flood outlined that when it came to hedge funds, artificial intelligence and GLP-1 were the two key trends that had driven index returns. He described it as \"a long momentum trade\" with \"both cohorts\" of the hedge fund side, namely the \"systemic and fundamental long-short\" fully involved in trading.\nThe Goldman equity head also added that retail investors were finally back as well, and they were focused on \"focused on the ten biggest stocks in the world.\" You can see which companies these might be by reading 20 Largest Companies in the World by Market Cap in 2024. One key concern among investors and analysts alike this year has been a bifurcation in market returns that has seen only the best performers yield most of the rewards. This was also on the mind of analysts from another well known Wall Street bank, who added that it created an opportunity for further profits. Flood shared that while five stocks accounted for \"60% of S&P 500's return year to date,\" this sharp divide did not make him uncomfortable.\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\nThe investor flood of optimism surrounding AI, which has pushed the shares of the top AI GPU designer in the world to post an unbelievable 321,150% in all time returns, has also led to worries that the market might be witnessing another period akin to the ill fated dotcom era of the 1990s. When asked whether this period reminded him of that time, Flood replied that his firm felt \"a little bit more like 1995 than 1999. And 1995 clearly was a very positive year for the stock market and a positive run,\" particularly since \"valuations and earnings from market leaders are way friendlier today than they were in 1999.\" Concluding by sharing that he felt \"very bullish\" the analyst also forecast his estimate for the flagship S&P. His estimate? Well, Flood believes that \"you could see S&P 500 trade well north of 6,000 this year as the biggest get bigger and we continue to just see a little bit of a news vacuum into the elections right now.\"\nThe bit about market bifurcation between big and small companies was also on the mind of GS' senior US portfolio strategist Ben Snider. He commented on the jump in small cap stocks in July when they gained as much as 2% while other indexes lost up to 1.98% due to investors positioning themselves for potential interest rate cuts. Snider explained that small cap stocks tend to take on more debt, and lower rates coupled with their lower market values lead to big gains. According to him \"if just 1% of assets comes out of the S&P 500 and flows into, for example, the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index, that 1% of S&P 500 market cap would represent more than 15% of Russell 2000 market cap.\" Coming back to AI, the Goldman strategist has a tip for those who might be worried that the hype surrounding AI might be more than the technology's ability to generate money for the firms that plan to plow a trillion dollars into it. He shared that as opposed to the market cap weighted benchmark S&P, it might be prudent to invest in the equal weight variant \"if you are concerned about the degree of concentration or AI investment.\"\nSpeaking of AI, GS was also out with a detailed report in July which analyzed the year to date returns of different AI sectors. The AI stack, broadly speaking, is made up of four categories of firms. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid and moving upwards, these are chip manufacturers and designers, those that provide AI capacity like server farms, firms that sell AI products, and finally, companies that will see the largest gains from the ubiquitous or near ubiquitous adaptation of AI. As per GS, the year to date returns of these four sectors as of late July were 139% (represented only by the top AI GPU stock), 22%, -2%, and 2% respectively. One of the strongest performers within the AI infrastructure segment is utilities, and there's further room ahead as analyst Ryan Hammond believes that \"after adjusting valuations for the improvement in long- term EPS growth expectations that the sector has experienced, Utilities\u2019 PEG (P/E to long term growth (LTG)) ratio is 2x, well below the historical average of 3x.\"\nSo, with GS taking a broad view of the market, we decided to see which hedge fund stocks the bank is a fan of.\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs' top hedge fund stocks, we ranked the bank's list of stocks with the number of hedge funds that, according to its data, had the stock as a top ten holding.\nWe also mentioned the total number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks as per Insider Monkey's data. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 165\nGS' Number Of Funds: 51\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the world's biggest search engine operator - a position that has also enabled it to play a pivotal role in the global advertising industry. The firm's primary line of business is selling ads to run on its search engine as well as for sites that have partnered up with it. While the scale of these operations provides Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) with a wide competitive moat, 2024 has been an important year for the firm. Not only has the Justice Department purportedly considered anti trust action against the company for being a monopoly after a court ruling, but the advent of artificial intelligence has created a new industry that could potentially disrupt the decades old internet search engine business model. However, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s considerable resources, as evidenced by a whopping $111 billion in cash and equivalents means that it can spend all the money that it wants to create new products. Additionally, its DeepMind division is one of the oldest players in the AI industry, and Google Cloud is Apple's preferred partner for AI training - both of which position it favorably in the AI race.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 26, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\nSemiconductor and AI leader Nvidia reports earnings next Wednesday, August 28 after the market close and investors are waiting with bated breath. Nvidia's remarkable performance over the past two years is almost unfathomable, yet the company\u2019s expansion appears it should continue at this same rapid pace for years to come.\nHere, we will cover the path Nvidia has taken to get to its current position, what to expect from next week\u2019s earnings report and whether it\u2019s possible for Nvidia to reach a $10 Trillion market capitalization.\nThe results Nvidia has provided its shareholders with over the last 25 years is truly hard to understate. Over that period, the stock has compounded at an annual rate of 35.4%, yielding a dizzying 217,000% return. Even more recently, over just the last five years, NVDA stock has compounded at an annual rate of 98.5%, 30xing investor money over that time.\nAt the depths of the 2022 bear market, Nvidia had a market cap of $250 billion; today, it stands at a staggering $3 trillion. The meteoric rise is a direct result of Nvidia\u2019s strategic focus on AI infrastructure through its data center products. Since the pivot, annual sales have nearly quadrupled to $80 billion, and are expected to double again by 2026. Even more impressive is that Nvidia boasts 53% net margins on that revenue.\nFueled by surging demand for AI-driven solutions, Nvidia positioned itself at the heart of the AI revolution. Nvidia\u2019s focus on strategic partnerships with major cloud providers, its continued innovation in AI software (like the CUDA platform), and its ability to foresee the massive potential of generative AI were key to the stock\u2019s unprecedented rally.\nPartnering with fellow tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet has been the primary driver of its growth. Because Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet run massive cloud computing operations, and much AI development will occur in the cloud they have plowed tens of billion into Capex spending. While this is hugely beneficial to Nvidia, it is also good for all three major cloud providers. It\u2019s a symbiotic relationship as Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft add more power users to their platforms and Nvidia sells them the hardware.\nIf we look at the current quarter earnings forecasts, we can put into perspective the incredible pace that Nvidia continues to grow both the top and bottom line. Sales for the quarter are expected to grow 110% year over year (YoY) to $28.2 billion, while earnings are projected to climb 133% YoY to $0.63 per share. Looking further out, the expectations are equally impressive.\nAlthough Nvidia had sat atop the Zacks Rank for nearly two years, as analysts were continuously upgrading earnings estimates, today it has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, which most definitely isn\u2019t a negative thing. There is nothing bearish about a rank #3, just simply that earnings estimates haven\u2019t been upgraded recently.\nIt isn\u2019t just possible, it\u2019s likely Nvidia will reach a market cap of $10 trillion within the next five years based on current forecasts. Today, Nvidia has a one year forward earnings multiple of 48.9x, which is well below its five-year median of 55x. Incredibly, Nvidia has grown so fast that even though the stock price is up 20x in the last five years, it is still close to its cheapest relative valuation because of the incredible profit growth.\nTo get to the conclusion that Nvidia may be worth $10 trillion is of course quite speculative, however a simple extrapolation shows how it is not an unreasonable expectation. Earnings are forecast to grow 37.6% annually over the next three to five years, and if the stock grows at that pace while maintaining its current earnings multiple, it would be there in under five years.\nFor investors seeking exposure to AI and high-growth tech, Nvidia remains among the most compelling options. Despite the incredible run-up in its stock price, the company\u2019s leadership in AI infrastructure, strategic partnerships, and unmatched growth rates suggest that Nvidia could still have significant upside potential.\nAt its core, Nvidia is positioned to remain a key player in the AI revolution, with its GPUs powering the future of AI-driven industries. The company\u2019s focus on continuous innovation and its partnerships with major cloud providers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet provide a strong foundation for future growth.\nWhile Nvidia\u2019s valuation is relatively high, it is backed by extraordinary earnings growth that is expected to continue at a rapid pace. The company's potential to reach a $10 trillion market cap underscores its long-term growth trajectory, making it an attractive investment for those with a higher risk tolerance and a long-term perspective.\nIn conclusion, Nvidia's stock may be a buy for investors who believe in the future of AI and are willing to weather short-term market volatility in exchange for long-term gains. With its leadership in the AI space and strong earnings growth projections, Nvidia could continue to reward investors as it moves toward new milestones.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Text": "The most recent trading session ended with Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) standing at $164.50, reflecting a -1.13% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.6%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.39%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.12%.\nShares of the company have depreciated by 3.19% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 2.97% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.15%.\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Alphabet Inc. in its upcoming earnings disclosure. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $1.83, marking a 18.06% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year.

These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell).

        "Title": "Prediction: 1 Unstoppable Stock Will Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet in the $2 Trillion Club Within 3 Years",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio ",
        "Text": "The U.S. economy has produced the world's most valuable companies for over a century. United States Steel became the first company to achieve a $1 billion valuation in 1901, and 117 years later, Apple became the first company to surpass a valuation of $1 trillion.\nApple was also the first company to cross the $2 trillion and $3 trillion thresholds. Only three other U.S. companies -- Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet \u2014 are valued at more than $2 trillion as of this writing, but I think one more is set to join them.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is the parent company of popular social networks Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads, and WhatsApp, but it's also becoming a serious contender in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. Meta is using AI to improve monetization on its social platforms, but it also developed the world's most advanced open-source large language model (LLM) called Llama.\nHere's how Meta could achieve a $2 trillion valuation within three years, and if it does, investors who buy the stock today could earn a 67% return.\nMeta serves over 3.2 billion people across its family of apps every single day. Social networks like Facebook and Instagram used to focus on connecting users with their friends and family, but they have transformed into entertainment platforms with AI-powered recommendation engines ensuring everybody sees the most relevant content, even if it wasn't posted by someone they know.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg says this shift is increasing the amount of time users spend on Meta's platforms, which means they view more ads and, therefore, become more valuable to the company. Speaking of which, Meta continues to develop AI tools for advertisers, too, which can help them create the most engaging content and target the most relevant audience.\nEventually, Zuckerberg says businesses will be able to tell Meta their objective and their budget, and its AI engine will autonomously handle the entire process for them \u2014 from crafting the creative to selecting the target audience. That's a game changer, because it means even the smallest business with no marketing team can yield the best possible return from its ad dollars.\nBut it gets better. Meta released a chatbot called Meta AI last year that can answer questions on most topics and even generate images on demand. It paves the way for Business AI, which could be a substantial revenue driver in the future. Zuckerberg believes every business will have its own AI agent trained to handle incoming queries from customers on Messenger and WhatsApp, for example, and even process sales. That will facilitate around-the-clock service even when the business owner is unavailable.\nLlama is the LLM that powers the exciting AI features I just mentioned. It's open-source, because Zuckerberg believes a widely deployed model used by thousands of developers will improve at a much faster rate than if Meta did all of the testing and troubleshooting alone.\nMeta just released Llama 3.1, and with 405 billion parameters, it's the most advanced version so far. Zuckerberg says Llama 3 is already competitive with most leading models, but he's focused on developing Llama 4, which he believes will set the standard for the industry next year.\nTraining Llama 4 will require up to 10 times the data center compute capacity compared to Llama 3, which means it will likely cost tens of billions of dollars in new infrastructure. I'll talk more about the cost in a moment, but better LLMs will result in more advanced user-facing AI applications, so Meta will have to invest heavily if it wants to stay ahead of the pack.\nOtherwise, users might spend more time on OpenAI's ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini instead of Meta AI, which could hurt the company's ability to generate revenue.\nMeta generated $39 billion in revenue during Q2, which was a 22% increase from the year-ago period. But the company's bottom line is the real story, because it continues to benefit from the cost-cutting measures enacted since late 2022. They involved 21,000 job cuts and a commitment from Zuckerberg to spend more cautiously on projects like the metaverse, which generate minimal revenue.\nAs a result, Meta's Q2 net income soared 73% year over year to $13.4 billion. That followed three straight quarters of triple-digit percentage growth.\nThe result was especially impressive when you consider the speed with which Meta is ramping up its capital expenditures for AI. It allocated $8.4 billion toward capex during Q2, which was up from the $6.3 billion it spent during the first quarter.\nMeta CFO Susan Li told investors capex could hit $40 billion for the whole of 2024, so spending appears set to accelerate in the second half of the year. Plus, Li forecasts \"significant\" growth in capex in 2025.\nNearly all of that money will go toward data center infrastructure, servers, and chips to accelerate the development of LLMs like Llama 4, which will bring new user-facing AI applications to life.\nBased on Meta's trailing-12-month earnings per share of $19.59 and its current stock price of around $488, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.9. That means it would have to rise 23% just to trade in line with the Nasdaq-100 index, which trades at a P/E ratio of 30.6. That alone would lift Meta's market cap to almost $1.5 trillion.\nBut Meta is even cheaper when measured against its future earnings. Wall Street expects the company to generate $23.93 in earnings per share during 2025, placing the stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 20.4. If that forecast is accurate and Meta's P/E ratio also rises to trade in line with the Nasdaq-100 by the end of next year, that will place its valuation at $1.8 trillion.\nThat implies Meta will only have to grow its earnings per share by 11% in 2026 to warrant a $2 trillion valuation. Considering the company grew its earnings at a compound annual rate of almost 30% in the decade between 2014 and 2023, I say there is a very good chance it delivers.\nPlus, there is a strong possibility that AI is a more powerful tailwind for Meta than analysts expect right now. The company's growing portfolio of AI tools \u2014 especially for businesses \u2014 could drive up marketing spending and also pull ad dollars away from its competitors. There is no telling how big that opportunity might become.\nEven if it doesn't get there within three years, I think Meta has a clear path to join the $2 trillion club eventually.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Self Driving Car Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other self driving car stocks.\nAdvancements in artificial intelligence, data analysis, and machine learning are shaping how industries perform today. These three technological advancements have enhanced the potential of autonomous vehicles and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).\nHowever, are the consumers ready to put their hands off the driving wheel and trust self-driving vehicles? Let\u2019s explore how the autonomous driving industry is progressing with almost all major automotive manufacturers investing significantly to put their Full Self Driving (FSD) cars on the road.\nAccording to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global autonomous vehicle market is valued at $41.10 billion in 2024. The market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 22.75% to reach $114.54 billion by 2029. The COVID-19 pandemic hindered the overall output of the automotive industry thereby delaying the production and roll-out of self-driving cars. In addition, increased government regulations to ensure road safety have also proved to be a barrier for automakers. However, with significant improvement in software and hardware technology backed by artificial intelligence, we see automakers rolling out their Level 2 and Level 3 autonomous cars on public roads.\nFor instance, on June 25 CNBC reported that Waymo a leading autonomous vehicle company, opened its self-driving robot taxis for users in San Francisco. The company claims that more than 300,000 people signed up for the service. To cater for the growing number of users Waymo One has rolled out a fleet of 300 cars in the city.\nAccording to a survey by McKinsey & Company, automotive market leaders believe the autonomous segment to be less fragmented due to the complexity and investment involved in its operations. As per the survey, 15% of the respondents believe North America will have most companies working and deploying autonomous technology in the future. In contrast, 38% of respondents believe the European market to be led by at most two or three companies.\nRegionally speaking, China and North America are leading the race to become the first countries to roll out Level 4 highway pilot technology. Respondents of the survey are equally divided with 58% believing either country could be the first in Level 4 technology.\nAs mentioned above, developing and rolling out autonomous vehicles requires a huge investment in software technology. However, the investment is also expected to return high margins. The survey found that experts believe autonomous vehicle software is expected to have an average margin of 15% and hardware technology will add another 10% to the margin, thereby making the autonomous vehicle segment a lucrative venture for automotive companies.\nEmerging trends in the autonomous vehicle industry are paving the way towards achieving level 5 autonomy. Some of the latest developments in the industry include, the use of Internet of Things (IoT) to allow vehicles to connect with other vehicles, its environment, and the internet. This not only improves the vehicle safety by providing quick data acquisition and analysis to make timely decisions based on the traffic changes on the road. New sensor technologies such as the LiDAR scans the surrounding of the car using laser technology. When these LiDAR sensors move continuously using multiple laser sensors they create a 3D representation of the surrounding ensuring the vehicle drives safely without collision. Almost all level 3 autonomous vehicles use LiDAR scanners to enhance vehicle visibility to around 300 meters during daytime.\nMoreover, advancements in artificial intelligence such as object detection algorithms along with the LiDAR help the vehicle detect pedestrians, traffic signs, and other vehicles on the road. Other deep learning algorithms are helping improve the user experience by enhanced voice recognition, gesture recognition, and sentiment analysis to help interact with the vehicle efficiently. Last but not the least, Big Data analysis techniques are being utilized by autonomous automakers to improve vehicle autonomy through analyzing data collected through radars, scanners, and cameras.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the 10 best self-driving car stocks to buy, we looked at autonomous driving stock holdings of the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF. We selected the top 20 stocks from the ETF holdings and ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q1 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 222\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a multinational technology conglomerate that offers various products and platforms internationally. It is the parent company of Google and other subsidiaries including Waymo, which focuses on developing autonomous vehicle technology.\nWaymo started as Google\u2019s self-driving car project and has progressed to become a leader in the autonomous vehicle industry. The subsidiary has served more than 2 million trips to date and has successfully driven 20 million autonomous hours on the road. Waymo makes Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), one of the best autonomous vehicle stocks to buy. It was held by 222 hedge funds during the Q1 of 2024, with total stakes worth $19.75 billion. Cantillon Capital Management is the top share holder of the company with a position worth $837.24 million.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong second quarter of 2024, with consolidated revenue growing 14% year-over-year to reach $84.7 billion. Growth in revenue due to strong performance across the board. The Google Cloud revenue made history by crossing the $10 billion mark for the first time and the operating profits reached over $1 billion for the quarter. Revenue for the Google services also went up by 12% year-over-year to reach $73.9 billion.\nAn overall strong revenue growth resulted in the net income growing to $23.6 billion during the quarter with free cash flow generation of $13.5 billion. This strong financial position of the company provides significant growth opportunities for its autonomous vehicle subsidy, Waymo. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) allocated $5 billion worth of funds for Waymo to support its ongoing operations, thereby indicating management\u2019s commitment to the cause. Waymo is now delivering over 50,000 weekly paid public rides in San Francisco and Phoenix, with testing ongoing in the Bay Area.\nThe company has a history of growth. It has been able to grow its top-line and bottom line by 18% and 21%, respectively over the last decade. 62 analysts have a consensus Buy rating on the stock, with their median price target of $205 presenting an upside of 24% from the current level.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\nOverall GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of the best self driving car stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's hard to overstate the degree to which artificial intelligence (AI) has altered the technology landscape since early last year, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the ranks of the world's most valuable businesses.\nWhile the No. 1 position has changed hands several times over the past 12 months, it's currently occupied by Apple. The company's recent AI announcements have energized the Apple faithful, driving its market cap to $3.4 trillion.\nWith its full-court press into AI, Microsoft takes up the No. 2 spot at $3.1 trillion. Nvidia, with its industry-leading AI chip, has doubled over the past year to earn the No. 3 spot at $2.9 trillion. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- each with solid AI game plans of their own -- are also members of this exclusive fraternity, with market caps of $2.1 trillion, $1.9 trillion, and $1.2 trillion, respectively (as of market close on Wednesday).\nWith a market cap of just $41 billion, it might seem like an exaggeration to suggest that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, might have a shot at joining the $1 trillion club. However, the strong, accelerating demand for servers designed to harness the power of AI -- and the company's years of experience in the field -- suggest Supermicro might have the qualities needed for membership.\nWhile Supermicro has only recently caught the attention of AI-centric investors, the company has been serving up custom-designed servers for more than three decades. This track record of experience served Supermicro well when those wanting to harness the power of generative AI came calling.\nThe company's claim to fame is its track record of developing power-miserly, rack-scale servers that boast a lower cost of ownership. Yet these cost-efficient systems are still able to provide the computational horsepower necessary to harness the power of AI and hyperscale data centers.\nFurthermore, Supermicro's building-block architecture ensures it can create a system to accommodate any budget or technology level. Finally, partnerships with the most important names in AI chips, including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others, ensure a steady supply of the most in-demand processors.\nThis successful strategy has helped generate meteoric growth. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), revenue surged 200% year over year to $3.8 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $6.56 soared 329%. Management is forecasting its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year revenue guidance to $14.9 billion, which would represent growth of 109%.\nManagement said Supermicro grew 5 times faster than the industry average over the preceding 12 months, suggesting the company is gaining market share. Analysts at Northland came to the same conclusion, noting the company has increased its market share from 8% to 11%, with \"plenty of room for future share gains.\"\nFinally, in a nod to Supermicro's importance within the broader market, the stock was added to the Nasdaq-100 Index on July 22.\nSupermicro has the inside track when compared to its rivals. When demand for AI servers ratcheted up last year, the company was nimble enough to adjust on the fly. Its strong relationships with all the top AI chipmakers gave Supermicro a steady supply of the processors needed to outfit its high-end servers. That said, it will be some time before Supermicro achieves the title of trillionaire.\nAccording to Wall Street, Supermicro is on track to deliver revenue of $14.9 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 2.75. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $363 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap. Still, those days are a long way off, as Supermicro is scrambling to increase its production capacity to support sales of $25 billion.\nIf the company can keep up its triple-digit year-over-year growth, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap as soon as 2029. However, even the bulls concede that maintaining growth of that magnitude is unlikely to happen. What's more likely is that the growth rate tapers off to a more manageable 50%, in which case Supermicro could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2032.\nSome on Wall Street believe the demand for AI-capable servers will continue for years. Bank of America analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya calculates the market will increase at a compound annual growth rate of 50% over the next three years, maintaining that Supermicro's revenue could \"grow even faster.\"\nThis helps underscore the massive opportunity. If Supermicro captures just a small part of that windfall, the company will be a member of the $1 trillion club in short order.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 17 Trending AI Stocks According to Latest News And Analyst Ratings.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nOne of the biggest breakthroughs of artificial intelligence in the past few years has been the advances in natural language processing. These AI models in language are now making their way into the business world and the society at large. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Expert economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani recently wrote in a report that the ability of AI tools to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects.\nSome of these macro factors are more discernible in the form of numbers. A recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models (read more about these firms by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To) compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\nThis exciting phase in the world of technology has ushered in a new boom for the world economy, previously plagued by inflation concerns, geopolitical conflicts, and stagnating demand figures. The bullish sentiment on AI needs to be balanced with caution. In the long run, investors should prepare themselves for significant changes to how the world works as AI could automate nearly 300 million jobs. In previous cycles of automation, new jobs and opportunities have risen to replace this. Recognizing these opportunities (read more about them by accessing 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave) ahead of the time could go a long way towards balancing the risk profiles of growth-heavy portfolios. Recent research suggests that 60% of the workforce presently was occupied in positions that did not exist just half a century ago, lending credence to claims that over 80% of employment growth since the time can be explained by tech-driven innovation.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. The company has been investing heavily in AI tech over the past few years. Recent reports indicate that Google Cloud, one of the products marketed by the firm, is allowing startups in the AI domain access to high-tech NVIDIA GPUs and customized Google chips in order to build their AI models. This opening up of the cloud to AI startups is only limited to startups funded by Y Combinator, a venture capital firm based in California near Google headquarters, presently. However, the tech giant may allow a wider group of AI firms access to the cloud in the coming months.\nEven as AI-powered search engines disrupt the core business of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), analysts like Scott Devitt of Wedbush, who has an Outperform rating on the shares with a price target of $205, believe the internet giant has a highly defensible search moat. Per the analyst, the search advancements of the firm are underappreciated by the market. Devitt notes that the firm has several advantages over peers, including an unmatched breadth of data to develop and train AI models, a large user base, AI-optimized compute infrastructure, access to engineering talent, and a track record of monetization.\nOverall GOOG ranks 5th on our of the trending AI stocks according to latest news and analyst ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Alphabet GOOGL is benefiting from strength in the Google Services segment, which is mainly driven by Search, YouTube and Android.The company is continuously expanding YouTube\u2019s capabilities to strengthen the Google Services segment.Per a 9to5Google report, Alphabet recently announced its plans to add a \u201cpersonal radio\u201d feature to YouTube Music, enabling users to publicly share their personal radio on their profile/channel page. Users can enable this feature by navigating to YouTube Music, selecting their profile icon, and then enabling public stats or public personal radio.This apart, the company added a \u201cMark as played\u201d feature to YouTube Music, allowing podcasters to mark an episode as played or unplayed, with confirmation messages appearing in the overflow menu.Alphabet\u2019s partnership with Garmin GRMN in a bid to boost YouTube Music\u2019s adoption rate by expanding its reach to more platforms remains noteworthy.The YouTube Music app is now available on Garmin IQ Connect smartwatches. The app experience is similar to Wear OS watches, with users able to search their library for music and podcasts and a slick playing page with physical buttons for play, pause, and skip.Growing YouTube Music efforts will enable Alphabet to capitalize on the solid growth opportunity present in the music streaming market, which, per a Grand View Research report, is expected to witness a CAGR of 14.4% between 2023 and 2030.Moreover, it would also aid Alphabet in narrowing down its gap with Spotify SPOT and Amazon AMZN.\u00a0Per a Statista report, Spotify maintained its dominant position in the music streaming space in 2023, with a market share of 32%.Amazon, on the other hand, is making continuous efforts to strengthen its foothold in the music streaming market with Amazon Music. It recently introduced Maestro, an AI playlist generator, in Amazon Music, enabling users to create any and all playlists, with the feature currently in beta for select U.S. customers.\nGoogle rolled out an updated version of YouTube\u2019s \"Erase Song\" tool, which allows content creators to remove copyrighted songs from videos without affecting other audio.The company also added a Cast menu redesign to the YouTube app. The updated Cast icon now features a floating bottom sheet with rounded corners, allowing users to control volume and voice search, and also provides remote control options for televisions.In addition to YouTube, Alphabet is making concerted efforts to enhance its search and Android capabilities in a bid to further boost the Google Services segment.Alphabet bolstered its search capabilities with the addition of a \u201cListen to this page\u201d text-to-speech feature on Google Chrome, enabling users to hear texts on web pages. This new feature will support several languages, including Arabic, Bengali, English, French, Chinese, German, Hindi and Portuguese, to name a few.The company recently introduced an \u201cEverything else\u201d feature in Google Wallet for Android to create digital passes for its users. This option allows users to scan a photo of any pass to create a digital version in Google Wallet.Google upgraded the Locked Folder for Google Photos to bolster its Android offerings. With this new upgrade, a \u201cLocked\u201d option appears directly next to the Favorites, Archive and Trash options in the Google Photos app for much faster access.All the above-mentioned endeavors are expected to drive the performance of the Google Services segment, which is the key growth catalyst for the company. In the second quarter of 2024, revenues from the Google Services business increased 11.5% year over year to $73.93 billion, accounting for 87.2% of the total revenues.The strengthening Google Services segment will, in turn, likely contribute to the overall financial performance of the company in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Regulatory scrutiny on AI firms is intensifying, particularly around issues of data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the ethical use of AI. Governments worldwide are beginning to implement regulations that could impact how AI technologies are developed and deployed. For instance, the European Union has proposed an AI Act that seeks to create a regulatory framework that addresses the risks associated with AI while promoting innovation. This regulatory environment could lead to increased compliance costs and slower adoption rates in certain sectors, posing a potential risk for investors.\nAnother critical consideration for investors is the talent shortage in the AI industry. The demand for skilled AI professionals far outstrips supply, leading to fierce competition among companies for top talent. This talent gap could slow down the development and deployment of AI technologies, particularly in smaller companies that may not have the resources to compete with tech giants like Google and Microsoft for talent. Despite these challenges, the overall outlook for the AI industry remains highly positive.

        "Title": "Is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) the Best Automation Stock to Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Bob Karr ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Automation Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other automation stocks.\n2023 was the year of\u00a0generative AI, mainly because of the widespread adoption of ChatGPT and the resulting response that followed. Now,\u00a02024 is the year in which companies have truly started using this ever-evolving technology. McKinsey revealed that AI supported the companies in both aspects: cost decreases and revenue jumps.\nIn 2024, the integration of automation technologies continues to revolutionize every aspect of supply chain management. This led to unprecedented levels of efficiency and agility. The global integrated automated supply chain is expected to reach US$25.6 billion by 2033, from US$13.4 billion in 2023, according to industry data by Market.us.\nFrom removing warehousing bottlenecks to inventory management and demand forecasting, supply chain automation reshaped traditional practices and redefined the dynamics of the logistics industry. \u00a0In inventory tracking, advanced warehouse management systems, which are powered by AI and ML algorithms, focus on optimizing inventory placement, route planning, resource allocation, etc.\nInventory tracking and management are being revolutionized through the usage of automation solutions, such as RFID tagging, barcode scanning, and computer vision. Real-time tracking technologies are offering granular visibility in inventory movements. This allows businesses to monitor stock levels, spot discrepancies, and manage understocking/overstocking. Manufacturers are now getting inclined towards smart factories.\nSmart factories reflect and demonstrate Industry 4.0 principles. They tend to leverage 5G, IoT, AI, and other advanced technologies. Experts believe that smart factories allow predictive maintenance and decision-making.\nA new theme is emerging in the field of automation, which is automated decision-making. Its adoption rapidly expanded beyond traditional sectors such as manufacturing and logistics. Demand for decision intelligence stems from data-driven and well-informed decision-making requirements which enhances corporate competitiveness and efficiency.\nAutomated decision-making is now being accepted by critical domains including healthcare and finance. In\u00a0healthcare, automation supplements the clinical decision-making processes, improves patient-care delivery, and manages resource allocation. It involves leveraging AI and ML algorithms to assess patient data, medical images, and genomic sequences, and customize patient care.\nLikewise, in\u00a0finance, automated systems continue to reshape top-notch operations like risk assessment, fraud detection, and investment management. AI algorithms assess large datasets of financial transactions and market trends to optimize investment strategies. In 2024, the software development industry is all set to embark on a remarkable transformation with cutting-edge innovations.\nThe latest technologies in software that are expected to reshape the landscape include quantum computing, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR),\u00a0big data, data analytics, 5G technology, robotics, etc.\nQuantum computing\u00a0continues to rapidly advance, evolve, and reshape scientific and industrial landscapes. Unlike classical computers\u2014which use bits as the smallest information unit\u2014quantum computers make use of qubits. These exploit quantum mechanics principles to perform complex and difficult calculations. For example, at the time of drug discovery, quantum algorithms simulate molecular interactions in a more accurate and refined way as compared to traditional methods. The integration of\u00a0quantum computing\u00a0with AI is another critical emerging trend.\nThe unprecedented advancements in robotics and AI are expected to bring revolutionary positive transformations. More and more sectors continue to understand the benefits of adopting robotics and AI. Globally, the robotics market should achieve healthy revenue growth, with a projected value of US$38.24 billion this year. The strongest segment in the robotics market is\u00a0expected to be service robotics, which should lead in market volume. Service robotics find its application in sectors, like Healthcare, Medical, Military and Defense, Logistics, etc. while industrial robots are used in Automotive, Electronics, Food & Beverage, etc.\nThe trends driving the robotics market are supported by developments in emerging technologies. These include 5G, AI, Edge Computing, IIoT, cloud, open-source, etc. Since AI in robotics continues to evolve, more and more industries are exploiting the latest technologies. Therefore, manufacturers are making data-driven decisions. Some industries use self-learning robots to execute work processes.\nSmart factories\u00a0are using AI-enabled robotics to execute smarter, reliable, and efficient processes. They help in production optimization. AI-powered robotic technologies, which include computer vision and tactile sensing, are utilized to help automate certain tasks. For example, reinforcement learning is used for better industrial assembly. The adoption of robotics, smart automation, and high-tech manufacturing will help workers with manual labor and reduce repetitive tasks.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nAverage Upside Potential: 23.95%\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) operates as a holding company. With the help of its subsidiaries, the company offers web-based searches, advertisements, maps, software applications, enterprise solutions, commerce, and hardware products.\nUiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH), which is a leading\u00a0enterprise automation and AI\u00a0software company, and Google Cloud announced an expanded partnership to help customers transform their enterprise with AI-powered automation. UiPath is now\u00a0available\u00a0on Google Cloud Marketplace. Therefore, Google Cloud customers can purchase UiPath Business Automation Platform. This will help them reliably deploy and scale automation initiatives on Google Cloud infrastructure.\nGoogle Cloud\u2019s expanding partnership with UiPath Inc. (NYSE:PATH) should create new opportunities for businesses as they will be able to streamline thousands of processes with AI and automation. These businesses will save costs and unlock new innovation.\nThe company has released its 2Q 2024 financial results, with total revenues coming at $84.7 billion. Of this, more than ~75% was contributed from advertising on Google Search and its other channels. As of now, investors are in a dicey situation as to what should be the next course of action after the recent Antitrust Defeat. For those who are unaware, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which is the parent company of Google, lost an antitrust lawsuit in Federal court.\nThe $20 billion in annual payments to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), made by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), for making Google the default search engine made the critical part of the case. The judge provided a ruling, wherein, he said that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) illegally stifled competition in its online search market.\nEven though this ruling is a major setback for the company, it should be noted that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) pays billions of dollars to several other companies. These are made to make Google Search the default search engine. Since the tech giant will not pay anymore, this can help the company save billions of dollars per year. Even though it is believed that the appeals process will take several years, Google\u2019s search market share should not reduce quickly. Apart from this, the company has included artificial intelligence features in Google. Because of this, it has collected massive amounts of user data. In 2Q 2024, the company\u2019s capital spending went up by 91% to reach $13.18 billion. The company is playing the long game when it comes to incorporating Al-powered technologies.\nAnalysts at Truist Financial upped their price objective on shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from $190.00 to $196.00. They have a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on 24th\u00a0July.\nAccording to Insider Monkey\u2019s 1Q 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was part of 222 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 214 in the last quarter.\nPatient Capital Management, a value investing firm, released its 2Q 2024 investor letter and mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 9th on our list of best automation stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 23, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. TSM, Intel Corp. INTC, Apple Inc. AAPL, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Arm Holdings plc ARM.\nThe semiconductor industry has witnessed stupendous growth over the past four decades, with chips becoming an integral part of electronic devices like computers and smartphones, to name a few. An increase in acceptance of emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to fuel demand for semiconductors.\nManufacturing, healthcare, and retail sectors have already integrated digital technologies that require robust semiconductor solutions. Thus, the global semiconductor industry is likely to witness a CAGR of 14.9% from 2024 to 2032, hitting $2062.59 billion by 2032, per Fortune Business Insights.\nHowever, despite the positive trend, picking the top semiconductor stocks is challenging since their sales fluctuate incessantly. So, here is one chip stock to buy right away \u2014 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. \u2014 and one industry bigwig to shun \u2014 Intel Corp.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing expects healthy demand for its chips as more companies begin to implement AI features in smartphones. Apple Inc.\u2019s initiative to launch the iPhone 16 this fall should boost demand for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2019s chips. The new \u201cApple Intelligence\u201d system has already benefited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Apple is one of the biggest clients of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and accounts for around one-fourth of TSM\u2019s revenues.\nDemand for AI applications like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Gemini and Open AI\u2019s ChatGPT has increased noticeably. But such applications require huge data, kept in data centers, which rely on graphic processing units (GPUs) that NVIDIA Corporation manufactures. And without TSM\u2019s manufacturing prowess, the GPUs can\u2019t be operative. So, in a way, the surging demand for AI applications would continue to boost Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2019s sales over the next several years and help its shares soar.\nNo doubt, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2019s earnings outlook for the current year remains promising, with the $6.45 Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share up 11.4% from a year ago.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2019s shares have already outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF this year (+64.6% vs. +22.6%).\nIntel, regrettably, is losing its competitive edge over its rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Intel is in a fix after failing to make much progress in its foundry business. AMD has progressed significantly in producing high-performance processing machinery. Intel\u2019s failure to take advantage of the ever-growing AI applications industry is alarming against the strong growth posted by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which is currently the industry standard.\nOn the other hand, Arm Holdings plc is disrupting Intel\u2019s server, storage, and networking space. ARM\u2019s designs in the micro server segment have witnessed espousal by quite a lot of Intel\u2019s competitors. As a result, Intel\u2019s earnings outlook for the current year remains bleak, with the $0.38 Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share down a massive 77.5% from a year ago.\nIntel\u2019s shares have underperformed SOXX year to date, down 57.4%. Notably, both Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel are listed in SOXX.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, by the way, has generated profits more competently than Intel. This is because TSM has a return on equity (ROE) of 25.5%, while Intel\u2019s is around 4.4%. As a thumb rule, any reading above 20% is primarily considered very strong.\nMeanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is a solid dividend payer, which is indicative of a stable business model. Its dividend payout ratio sits at 31% of earnings, a low payout that indicates the company is reinvesting the bulk of its earnings in research and development, a must for growth. Whereas, Intel\u2019s dividend payout ratio is 109% of earnings, which is unsustainable.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2019s shares are less expensive than Intel\u2019s, which has given the integrated circuit foundry an edge over the world\u2019s largest semiconductor company. After all, buying INTC\u2019s shares will burn a larger hole in your wallet than the TSM stock.\nThis is because, per the Price/Earnings ratio, TSM stock presently trades at 26.5X forward earnings. However, INTC\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 56.6X.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, rightfully, is a better buy than Intel as it is well-positioned to make the most of the growth in AI, can generate profit consistently, and has a lower valuation.\nProminent brokers have also increased the average short-term price target of TSM by almost 19% from the company\u2019s last closing price of $172.04. The analysts\u2019 highest price target is at $250.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this internet search leader have returned -0.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 7.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share, indicating a change of +18.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.63 points to a change of +31.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $72.79 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $296.53 billion and $330.36 billion estimates indicate +15.6% and +11.4% changes, respectively.\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 14, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Alphabet GOOGL, Arm Holdings ARM and Skechers SKX.\nEarnings season is always exciting for investors, with companies finally unveiling what's transpired behind the scenes.\nAnd concerning positivity throughout the current Q2 cycle, three companies \u2013 Alphabet, Arm Holdings and Skechers \u2013 posted quarterly records. Let's take a closer look at each quarterly print.\nAlphabet's quarterly release was overall positive, but the post-earnings reaction certainly didn't reflect the favorable results. The tech titan posted 31% earnings growth paired with a 14% sales increase, with Google Cloud revenues of $10.3 billion reflecting a quarterly record.\nImportantly, operating income from Google Cloud saw a sizable jump, reported at $1.2 billion vs. $395 million in the year-ago period. The favorable cloud results reflected the company's third consecutive beat on the metric\nShares have faced pressure over the last month, down 13% and partly reflective of profit-taking after a monster run. Still, the valuation picture for the company has become considerably attractive, with the current 19.9X forward 12-month earnings multiple nowhere near the 22.3X five-year median.\nThe current PEG ratio works out to 1.1X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth.\nIn addition to profit-taking, commentary surrounding CapEx spooked some, with investors seemingly becoming impatient concerning tailwinds from its AI-related investments. Still, the company believes underinvesting is a much greater risk to its future.\nThe stock maintains a bright outlook, with the $7.62 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 13% over the last year and suggesting 30% Y/Y growth.\nArm's quarterly prints in its short history have reflected favorable underlying business trends, regularly breaking records set in prior releases. Though the recent results snapped a streak of post-earnings positivity, the stock is up 80% on a YTD basis.\nIts latest positive results were driven by record royalty revenue, with Armv9 (the company's most advanced technology) penetration growing rapidly. In fact, revenue from chips based on Armv9 technology contributed around 25% of royalty revenue in the period, up from roughly 20% in the period before and 15% in the period prior to that.\nNotably, increased adoption of Armv9 in the mobile market led to 50% year-over-year smartphone royalty revenue growth, with other markets also beginning to ramp up. The company's compute platform remains the most power-efficient, explaining why many notable companies have inked deals with ARM.\nSkechers has made a quiet comeback over recent years, with brand momentum leading the charge. The apparel giant posted record quarterly sales in its latest release, with its earnings outlook remaining bright across the board following the print.\nThe stock presently sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nThe CFO's comments confirmed the brand momentum: 'Skechers continues to reach new milestones in expanding our global footprint. Achieving another sales record and exceptional earnings is a testament to the strength of our brand and our ability to meet consumers' needs.'\nSkechers topped off the favorable results with a guidance upgrade, also revealing a new $1 billion share repurchase program in a shareholder-friendly nature. It's worth noting that the company's margins continue to be highly favorable, with further margin expansion occurring throughout the period.\nThe 2024 Q2 earnings cycle is slowly winding down, with several companies \u2013 like the three above \u2013 posting quarterly records.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods,\u00a0please click here>>>\nHere are the key points:\nThe overall picture that has emerged out of the Q2 earnings season is one of stability and an improving earnings outlook, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality. That said, estimates for the current period have started to weaken faster than we saw in the last two periods.\nFor the 431 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, or 86.2% of the index\u2019s total membership, total earnings are up +10.6% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 79.8% beating EPS estimates and 59.2% beating revenue estimates.\nFor 2024 Q3, total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +4.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway, with the current +4.7% earnings growth pace down from +6.9% in early July.\nQ2 earnings for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 companies are expected to be up +33.5% from the same period last year on +14.3% higher revenues. Excluding the \u2018Mag 7\u2019, Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +6.2% (from +11.0%).\nThe \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 stocks - Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA \u2013 have been in the spotlight in the ongoing market turmoil. This followed these companies\u2019 Q2 quarterly releases that mostly failed to impress market participants, particularly the reports from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla.\nAs we noted in this space recently, the market\u2019s issue with the Mag 7 companies\u2019 quarterly reports wasn\u2019t so much their current earnings or outlooks for the coming periods but rather with their ever-rising capex levels that are going towards AI projects. Market participants would like to see a clearer monetization path for these AI investments, but management teams have generally been unable to provide that level of visibility.\nWe don\u2019t see elevated capex by Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, or any other Tech operator as an issue. After all, these investments will ensure that these companies remain at the cutting edge of this evolving new business opportunity.\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, we now have Q2 earnings from all but Nvidia, which is scheduled to report on August 28th. For the group as a whole, combining the actual results from the six companies that have reported already with estimates for Nvidia, total Q2 earnings are on track to be up +33.5% on +14.3% higher revenues.\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +20.6% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.5%, followed by another strong showing expected next year. A big contributing factor to the Tech sector\u2019s positive earnings outlook is the sector\u2019s margins outlook.\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year\u2019s record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector\u2019s productivity.\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway.\nThis is a bigger decline to estimates relative to the comparable periods for the two preceding quarters. The negative revisions trend is widespread and not concentrated in one or two sectors, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut over this period. The Tech and Finance sectors are the only ones enjoying positive estimate revisions over this period.\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +8.4% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +8.1%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.2%. In other words, about half of this year\u2019s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.
