        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NASDAQGS over the last few months, increasing to US$154 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$129. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Alphabet's current trading price of US$139 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Alphabet\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nGood news, investors! Alphabet is still a bargain right now. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $211.45, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. However, given that Alphabet\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 48% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Alphabet. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? Since GOOGL is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on GOOGL for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy GOOGL. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

        "Title": "Is Alphabet Stock a Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has long been a stock market winner. Shares have risen by 338% in the past 10 years. This performance outpaces both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite.\nBut at a market cap of nearly $1.7 trillion, you might be wondering if this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock is a smart buy today. Here is why I think it is.\nOne mark of a great business is its financial performance, particularly over several years. Here's where Alphabet absolutely shines.\nFor starters, growth has been impressive. In the last decade, the company's revenue and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased at compound annual rates of 18.7% and 19.6%, respectively. Tackling massive -- and expanding -- end markets, while benefiting from scale advantages, helps.\nAnd looking ahead, it's easy to be optimistic that the double-digit gains will continue. Wall Street analysts' consensus estimates predict revenue will rise at an annualized pace of 10.6% over the next three years, with diluted EPS growing at a 15.1% yearly clip.\nAlphabet's finances are in tip-top shape. In the last three years, the company produced a whopping $285 billion of cumulative operating cash flow. That figure alone exceeds the market caps of the majority of public companies out there.. With more money than it knows what to do with, Alphabet has consistently bought back stock, reducing the outstanding share count by roughly 10% in the past five years.\nAs of Dec. 31, the company had a net cash position of $98 billion. This reduces financial risk by adding a huge buffer should economic conditions deteriorate. At the same time, Alphabet should still be able to invest aggressively in growth initiatives, while smaller rivals might have to play defense just to survive.\nAlphabet owns and operates some of the most widely used digital services on the face of the planet. CEO Sundar Pichai summed up this dominance when he commented in the Q2 2023\u00a0earnings press release: \"With fifteen products that each serve half a billion people, and six that serve over two billion each, we have so many opportunities to deliver on our mission.\"\nOf course, Google Search, which generated 56% of overall company revenue in the fourth quarter, remains Alphabet's crown jewel. It commands a 90%-plus share of the global search market, a figure that has remained steady even with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022.\nThere's also Chrome (web browser), Android (mobile operating system), and Gmail (email service). All of these lead their respective product categories on a worldwide stage.\nBesides those popular internet properties that make Alphabet a leading tech titan, there are other significant value drivers that can't be ignored.\nYouTube, which the company acquired for $1.7 billion in 2006, generated $31.5 billion in sales in 2023, making it arguably one of the most successful acquisitions in corporate history. According to data from Nielsen, YouTube attracts the most TV viewing time of any streaming service in the U.S. -- even more than Netflix. And it benefits from powerful network effects.\nGoogle Cloud posted revenue growth of 26% in 2023, and it reported four straight quarters of positive operating income. Because the cloud market is set to continue expanding at a rapid clip in the years ahead due to enterprise and government clients moving to off-premises IT infrastructure, this segment will be propelled by a powerful tailwind. \nAnd with Waymo, Alphabet also has a top player in autonomous driving software. The self-driving segment increases Alphabet's optionality, because it could pay off over the long term.\nDriven by Q4 financial results that the market wasn't happy with, shares of Alphabet have fallen 12% since Jan. 30 (as of March 7). And the stock is currently 13% below its peak price. But I view this as an opportunity.\nShares are trading hands at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.7. In my opinion, this looks like an absolute no-brainer buying decision for investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Alphabet stock could see a big surge as Google is a \"clear winner\" in AI, according to Wedbush.\nAnalysts pointed to multiple advantages the Google parent has over other firms in the AI space.\nMore upside could lie ahead if Alphabet expands partnerships and issues more guidance on AI projects.\nAlphabet stock is primed for a big jump, as Google will emerge as a clear winner in the artificial intelligence race that's gripped Wall Street, Wedbush analysts said in a recent note.\nThe firm added Alphabet stock to its \"Best Ideas List\" and raised its price target on the Google parent from $160 to $175 per share. That implies a 15% upside from the stock's current levels, with Alphabet trading around $152 a share on Friday morning.\n\"We believe the perceived structural risks to Google Search are overstated and continue to view Alphabet as a net beneficiary of generative AI,\" analysts said in a note on Friday.\nThe new price target is largely because of Alphabet's \"multifaceted\" edge over other competitors in the AI race, Wedbush said, such as its wide breadth of available data to train AI models and its massive user base across its products, like Android, Search, and YouTube.\nThe company could also soon be collaborating with Apple to incorporate its Gemini AI into iPhones.\nShares of the tech titan have lagged the gains of other Magnificent Seven names like Amazon and Microsoft, which are up 18% and 14%, respectively year-to-date, and the stock has underperformed the wider Nasdaq which is up by about 11% for the year.\nHowever, sentiment over Alphabet's AI endeavors has improved, analysts said, citing more upbeat commentary on Google in recent months. Meanwhile, Alphabet shares are still up over 6% since the start of the year. That displays some resilience in the stock, despite controversy arising in March after Gemini was known to create historically inaccurate images.\nThe stock could see more upside catalysts in the future, Wedbush said, adding it was looking for the Google parent to issue more guidance on its business model for its Search Generative Experience, deeper \"cost reengineering\" to develop its AI projects, as well as more partnerships to develop AI models with other firms.\n\"We continue to view Alphabet as a secular winner within the digital advertising industry with broad exposure and durable market share of overall media spending,\" analysts added.\nWedbush has been bullish on Alphabet and the broader AI-fueled rally for months. AI is likely spawning a new 1995-style tech bull market, Wedbush analysts said in a previous note, predicting tech stocks could soar another 33% in 2024.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is better known by some of the brands it owns, like Google and YouTube. It's one of the largest tech companies and one of the members of the exclusive trillion-dollar market-cap club. However, thanks to other tech giants posting strong quarters, it has lost its place as the third-largest U.S. company behind Microsoft and Apple. Nvidia and Amazon have now passed it, although Amazon may fall beneath Alphabet on a day-to-day basis.\nSo, is there something wrong with the stock? Let's look at all sides of the analysis, then decide which camp is best.\nThe biggest factor in many big tech companies' success right now is artificial intelligence (AI). AI progress and optimism is why Nvidia has shot up so dramatically over the past year, and what propelled Microsoft to pass Apple as the world's largest company.\nFrom the start, Alphabet has appeared behind in the AI race. It lost to ChatGPT as the first to launch a usable generative AI product, and to Microsoft's Bing as the first search engine to integrate generative AI. Additionally, its generative AI engine, Gemini, has recently been subjected to bad press, as its image generation feature failed to depict accurate images of prompts.\nThe big problem is that if Alphabet's AI model is flawed, or shows a particular bias, it can affect its primary business: advertising. The Gemini model will become the basis of everything Alphabet does, and if it causes issues with Alphabet's advertising model, advertisers may look elsewhere to spend. Considering that 76% of Alphabet's total revenue comes from ads, this would be a big problem.\nAlphabet is well aware of the issues with its Gemini model. It apologized for the image generation issue and vowed to improve the platform. Additionally, just because the consumer-facing model does one thing doesn't mean that there isn't a different model being used internally to perform tasks like improving search results.\nThe Gemini model still scores better than many competitors in tasks like math and coding, making it a clear choice for many applications.\nWhile time will tell what Alphabet does, investors should be assured that the company isn't letting a generational investment opportunity slip by.\nBecause of Alphabet's various problems, there isn't much of a premium attached to the stock. Alphabet is trading for just 21 times earnings estimates, the same as the S&P 500.\nEssentially, the market is valuing Alphabet like an average company. While this assessment may be fair due to its lackluster performance in critical product development, if Alphabet hits its stride, the company will look incredibly undervalued.\nAs another side note, if Alphabet fetched the same premium as Microsoft (35 times forward earnings), its market cap would be $2.95 trillion -- making it the second-largest company in the world and only a bit behind Microsoft at $3.05 trillion.\nPerception is a big part of how stocks are valued in the market, and market sentiment about Alphabet isn't great right now.\nSo, which viewpoint makes the most sense?\nIn my opinion, the stock is a buy. The other big tech firms are expensively priced, and not doing so much better that they warrant those massive premiums. As a result, Alphabet is one of my top tech stocks to buy right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "There is an answer for investors who fear they missed out on the big rally in technology stocks. After strong 2023 returns, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock has underperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index so far this year.\nShares of Google's parent company are up about 1% in 2024 while the index has returned nearly 7%. But with businesses including the leading online search engine, a growing YouTube social media platform, and one of the top three cloud computing platforms, Alphabet stock could be ready to take off again.\nAlphabet still gets most of its revenue from advertising, and an online advertising slowdown has soured investors on the company's stock. Google advertising revenue declined by more than 10% in fourth quarter of 2023 year over year.\nBut Alphabet's cloud segment is growing and has increased its revenue share for the past several years. Google Cloud contributed nearly 11% of Alphabet's sales in 2023, compared to just 4.3% in 2018.\nInvestors seem to think it is falling behind in the race to monetize artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, though. The company famously muddled the introduction of its Gemini AI model. But even if Alphabet is losing the sprint for a successful generative AI offering, it could be a winner in the AI marathon. \nThat's because cloud users are integrating AI tools to modernize their businesses. The integration of AI will require more and more computing power. That's evident in the exploding revenue Nvidia has been reporting from sales of its H100 graphics processing units (GPUs). \nWhat's important for Alphabet, and specifically Google Cloud, is that AI is intensifying the adoption of cloud computing. Tim Potter, a principal at Deloitte Consulting, noted that \"Most AI solutions are either services offered directly by cloud hyperscalers or solutions built on top of a hyperscaler's cloud infrastructure.\"\nThat's good news for leading cloud providers like Alphabet and should help to meaningfully drive its business going forward. \nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Of all of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, the one getting the least respect right now is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Alphabet has been plagued by many publicity blunders related to its generative artificial intelligence (AI) model, but these failures likely won't last forever.\nSo, where will Alphabet be five years down the road?\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google, Android, YouTube, and more. While these seem like varied businesses, they are all heavily focused on advertising. Advertising provides 76% of Alphabet's revenue, so excelling in this area is crucial. It's also why getting its AI model right is critical.\nAmong the ways Alphabet uses AI is to make better choices about which ads reach which people. If its results on that front are weak, advertisers may not feel that spending with Alphabet is critical for optimal performance and look elsewhere to spend their ad dollars. This hasn't happened yet -- Alphabet's ad revenue rose 11% year over year in Q4.\nAlso, Alphabet's generative AI product, Gemini, made its fair share of public blunders since its launch. From AI image generation issues to its generative AI model giving incorrect answers to questions, its rollout has been far from smooth.\nThe most important part of any AI model is data, and Alphabet is about to get a huge boost in its data quantity and quality. Apple is reportedly considering integrating Alphabet's Gemini model into its iPhones. This partnership would give Alphabet information on an important user base, making the ad space it sells more valuable.\nThis kind of information could make Alphabet's AI model a force to be reckoned with in five years. But the market is treating Alphabet like it's already doomed.\nUnlike many of its big-tech peers, Alphabet's stock is not trading at a premium valuation. It's valued at just under 22 times earnings, which is far from what others trade at.\nWith Microsoft and Apple trading at 37 and 26 times earnings, respectively, Alphabet looks fairly priced compared to the others.\nThis sets Alphabet up for a nice run, as its future growth isn't priced into its stock. With Wall Street analysts projecting 11% growth in the next two years, the stock is set up to provide investors with market-beating returns (greater than 10% per year).\nAnd that doesn't include the effects of stock buybacks.\nAlphabet has taken advantage of its cheap valuation by repurchasing its shares. In Q4 alone, it bought back $16.2 billion in stock. This reduced its outstanding share count by over 3%, which boosted its earnings per share.\nAdditionally, Alphabet's operating margin ticked up thanks to disciplined spending.\nAll of this combines to make it a company that can grow its earnings per share by a percentage in the mid-teens range -- a much faster pace than it's growing its revenues. This sets the stock up to potentially crush the market over the next five years.\nAs a result, I think Alphabet is a fantastic stock to buy right now, as it is well set up for the future if it gets its AI models right. Because of Alphabet's vast engineering resources, I don't think this will be much of a problem.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Technology stocks are off to a strong start in 2024, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index clocking 9.8% gains as of this writing. The same cannot be said about Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), as shares of the technology giant are flat so far in 2024.\nAlphabet delivered solid results at the beginning of the year, but its ad revenue wasn't up to the market's expectations. Additionally, concerns were raised by investors about Alphabet's ability to compete in the generative artificial intelligence (AI) market after its chatbot Gemini ran into controversy.\nCan the company turn around negative investor perceptions and deliver solid returns to investors over the next five years? Let's find out.\nIn 2023, Alphabet reported total revenue of $307.4 billion, a 10% jump over the previous year in constant currency terms. That was a drop in growth from the 14% jump the company clocked in 2022. Analysts expect Alphabet's revenue growth to improve slightly in 2024, rising at an 11.4% rate to total $342.6 billion.\nHowever, as the following chart indicates, Alphabet's pace of growth is expected to decelerate slightly over the next couple of years.\nThere are a couple of reasons why that may be the case.\nFirst, the company's ad business is under threat from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Alphabet's Google Advertising revenue was up just 6% in 2023 to $237.8 billion. Meta Platforms, on the other hand, delivered a 16% jump in advertising revenue last year to $132 billion. It is worth noting that the digital ad market recorded 10.7% growth in 2023, according to eMarketer. So Meta's faster growth than the digital advertising market means that it is gaining share in this lucrative niche from Alphabet.\nMoreover, Alphabet's estimated revenue growth for 2024 means that it could keep losing share to Meta. That's because the digital ad market is forecast to grow 13.2% this year, and analysts predict a 17% increase in Meta's revenue in 2024.\nAlphabet's growth is also expected to stay mediocre because of the competition in its cloud computing business. Though Google Cloud revenue increased an impressive 26% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $9.2 billion, competitor Microsoft's Azure cloud increased 30% year over year in its corresponding quarter thanks to the growing adoption of its AI-focused cloud services.\nAll this indicates why investors seem to prefer other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks this year instead of Alphabet. There is no doubt that Alphabet is trying to get its foot in the door of the generative AI market, with management explaining the company's AI-related efforts at length on the January earnings conference call, but the numbers indicate that its peers are using this technology in a better way to boost their financial performance.\nHowever, there is one reason why investors might still want to consider taking a chance on Alphabet and buying the stock right now for the long haul.\nThe rapid rise in the stock prices of Alphabet's Magnificent Seven peers means they trade at expensive valuations (see chart below).\nBuying Alphabet at this valuation could turn out to be a smart long-term move. We have seen that its cloud business is already growing at a healthy pace, and certain analysts believe that it could gain ground in the generative AI market as well. JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth, who has an overweight rating on Alphabet stock, predicts that the company could make a comeback in the generative AI space.\nThat wouldn't be surprising, as the company is aggressively adding generative AI tools into its advertising tools to drive greater returns for advertisers. So with the stock trading at 23 times trailing earnings and 20 times forward earnings -- a discount to the Nasdaq-100's earnings multiple of 32 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks) -- investors are getting a good entry point.\nAnalysts predict Alphabet's earnings will increase at an annual rate of 19% for the next five years. Based on its 2023 earnings of $6.79 per share, the company's bottom line could increase to $13.84 per share in five years. If Alphabet's growth picks up by that time and the market rewards it with a higher earnings multiple, this tech stock could deliver impressive gains.\nEven if Alphabet is trading at 24 times forward earnings after five years, which is equivalent to its five-year average forward price-to-earnings ratio, its stock price could jump to $332 in five years. That would be a 138% increase from current levels, which is why it may be a good idea to buy Alphabet while it is still cheap.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Eric Volkman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "As the seemingly eternal leader in internet search, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has made a great many investors richer over the course of its more than 25-year history. Lately, though, it hasn't been the most exciting stock, neither soaring higher nor crashing violently in price on the tech sector's gyrations.\nSome believe it's being unfairly ignored by the market, and the market is missing a chance to get a solid investment at a cheap price. Let's explore one analyst's bullish take on the company.\nAs February came to a close, Redburn-Atlantic's James Cordwell upped his price target on Alphabet's class A voting shares (the ones with the GOOGL ticker symbol). These should be worth $170 apiece, according to him, up from his previous level of $165. In making his change, Cordwell maintained his buy rating on the shares.\nThat makes for a potential gain of around 30% on both classes of Alphabet's stock, given that they're hovering around the $130 level these days and they trade at basically the same level.\nCordwell feels that Alphabet is priced more like a traditional blue chip stock in an unexciting industry than a leader dominating a corner of the tech sector. He wrote in a note that with \"Alphabet's forward P/E now just in line with that of the [S&P 500 index] sentiment has clearly turned negative regarding Google Search's competitive position and ongoing growth potential.\"\nIt can be tough for a company that's been so firmly established in its niche to win investor love.\nWith longevity, more people can take a business for granted and forget that it still might have powerful growth in front of it. Technological advances will make internet search more of a valuable resource, not less, and there's no meaningful competition to the powerhouse that is Alphabet. That makes Cordwell's latest take on the stock rather compelling and $130 looks like a cheap price for a company with a bright future.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Despite more than a year of seemingly nonstop coverage on the artificial intelligence (AI) market, Wall Street just can't get enough. The industry remains a high-growth area, with plenty of investment opportunities.\nData from Grand View Research shows the AI market hit nearly $200 billion last year and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. That rate would see the segment achieve a valuation nearing $2 trillion by decade's end.\nSo despite the industry's meteoric rise over the last year, it seems to have barely scratched the surface of its potential. As a result, it's not too late to dedicate a portion of your holdings to AI and benefit from its growth for years.\nTwo exciting options are Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), with one expanding in the hardware side of the industry and the other investing in its AI software offerings.\nLet's examine these businesses more closely and determine whether you're better off investing in the budding AI market through AMD's or Alphabet's stock.\nShares in AMD have climbed 43% year to date. The company rallied investors by pivoting its business to AI as it seeks to claim a slice of the lucrative market.\nIn 2023, Nvidia stole much of the spotlight, as it snapped up an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs) while AMD was left playing catch-up. However, AMD shifted its focus over the last year and could make a big splash in the industry in 2024.\nLast December, the company unveiled its new MI300X AI GPU. The chip was designed to compete directly with Nvidia's offerings and already caught the attention of some of tech's most prominent players, signing on Microsoft and Meta Platforms as clients.\nAMD's earnings have yet to reflect its heavy investment in AI. However, its financials are moving in a positive direction. In its fourth quarter of 2023, AMD's revenue rose 10% year over year to $6 billion, beating analysts' expectations by about $60 million.\nThe company's AI-focused data center segment posted revenue growth of 38%. Meanwhile, improvements in the PC market boosted AMD's client segment by 65% year over year.\nIn addition to AI chips, AMD is diversifying its role in the market by expanding in AI PCs as it seeks to dominate its own area of the industry.\nIt's impossible to deny Alphabet's top spot in tech, with brands like Android, YouTube, and Google attracting billions of users worldwide. The popularity of these offerings has seen Alphabet snap up a leading 25% market share in the digital advertising market.\nHowever, over the last year, all eyes have been on the tech giant's expanding AI efforts. Toward the end of 2023, the company impressed by debuting Gemini, a large language model that looked likely to make Alphabet competitive against cloud rivals Microsoft and Amazon.\nYet the Google company's stock is down 7% in the last month after a disappointing launch for Gemini. Alphabet held a presentation for the new AI model recently, and Gemini gave inaccurate depictions of historical figures and failed to recognize key differences between other prominent figures. The blunders forced Alphabet to take its AI image services offline for now.\nIn spite of recent headwinds, Alphabet hit nearly $70 billion in free cash flow last year. The company has a mountain to climb to get its AI tech on track and keep up with competitors, but Alphabet is financially secure and has the funds to keep investing in its business.\nDespite having a slower start than their respective rivals in AI, AMD and Alphabet have promising prospects in the industry over the long term. However, for now, Alphabet's recent software fumbles make AMD's chip business feel more secure.\nMeanwhile, earnings per share (EPS) estimates suggest AMD might have more room to run over the next two years.\nThe chart shows AMD's earnings could reach just over $7 per share in the next two fiscal years, while Alphabet's may hit nearly $9 per share. On the surface, Alphabet looks like the clear winner.\nHowever, multiplying these figures by the companies' recent forward price-to-earnings ratios (AMD's 58 and Alphabet's 20) yields projected stock prices of $418 for AMD and $176 for Alphabet. Based on their current positions, these projections would see AMD's stock rise 98% and Alphabet's 30% by fiscal 2026.\nAlongside a more reliable role in AI, AMD's stock is a screaming buy over Alphabet this month.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Both are off record highs set earlier in the year and neither one is performing like NVIDIA, up triple digits.\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)owns Apple shares. Warren Buffett bought a big position in the company in 2016 and considers it one of the four lynchpins of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s business.\nBuffett loves it so much, he gushes about Apple at nearly every Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.\nBerkshire Hathaway Bought Apple on the Cheap\nIt may be hard to believe today, but Apple was out of favor in 2016 when Buffett dove in. It traded with a forward P/E as low as 10.6 that year. Apple\u2019s 2024 forward P/E is 28. No one is calling Apple a value stock in 2024.\nApple also had a cheap P/S ratio in 2016. The high that year was 2.8 and the low was 2.3. Currently, Apple trades with a P/S ratio of 7.3. It\u2019s not over 10, which is considered expensive, but 7.3 is above the current average of the S&P 500 at 4.2.\nApple also had an attractive P/B ratio in 2016. It\u2019s high was 4.7 and low was 3.9 that year. A P/B under 3.0 usually indicates value. Currently, Apple\u2019s P/B ratio is a sky-high 38.\nCriteria for Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway to Buy a Stock\nBuffett loves companies with great free cash flow and Alphabet has doubled its free cash flow since 2019. In 2023, it had annual free cash flow of $69.5 billion, up from $30.9 billion in 2019.\nBuffett also likes companies that are doing share buybacks and Alphabet announced a $70 billion buyback in April 2023.\nDoes Alphabet have a moat? Berkshire Hathaway looks for companies with competitive advantages of a \u201cmoat.\u201d\nAlphabet\u2019s advertising revenue has been a moat over the last two decades, although some are questioning whether AI might eat into it. But Alphabet also has YouTube, which recently posted its best quarter for ad revenue ever.\nBuffett also likes companies with great management who have been in a place for years. Alphabet fits that bill.\nWill Buffett Buy Shares of Alphabet for the Berkshire Hathaway Stock Portfolio? \nTune into this week\u2019s podcast for Tracey\u2019s analysis of Alphabet\u2019s valuation. The stock is on sale. But is it cheap enough for Buffett to dive in?\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL in her personal portfolio.]\n\u00a0\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Using Too Much Debt?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. As with many other companies Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nThe chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Alphabet had US$12.9b in debt in December 2023; about the same as the year before. But it also has US$110.9b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$98.0b net cash.\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Alphabet had liabilities of US$81.8b due within a year, and liabilities of US$37.2b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$110.9b in cash and US$48.0b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it can boast US$39.9b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nThis surplus suggests that Alphabet has a conservative balance sheet, and could probably eliminate its debt without much difficulty. Simply put, the fact that Alphabet has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.\nAnd we also note warmly that Alphabet grew its EBIT by 18% last year, making its debt load easier to handle. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Alphabet's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nBut our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. Alphabet may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the last three years, Alphabet recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 81% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Alphabet has US$98.0b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. The cherry on top was that in converted 81% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$69b. So is Alphabet's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Alphabet, you may well want to click here to check an interactive graph of its earnings per share history.\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "With its stock down 7.2% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. Specifically, we decided to study Alphabet's  ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:\n26% = US$74b \u00f7 US$283b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.26 in profit.\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nFirstly, we acknowledge that Alphabet has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 8.7% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for Alphabet's moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.\nAs a next step, we compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 7.8%.\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is GOOGL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\nAlphabet doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Alphabet's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "Title": "Google\u2019s founders didn\u2019t market test Alphabet\u2019s name before launching the now $1.9 trillion juggernaut. Here\u2019s the advice Steve Jobs gave Larry Page",
        "Author": "  Sasha Rogelberg ",
        "Text": "Even from Google\u2019s inception, cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin considered the company\u2019s potential for astronomical growth. Named after \u201cgoogol,\u201d the term for the numeral 1 with 100 zeros behind it, Google, then just a search engine founded in 1998, would become as large as the internet would allow.\nThe company has far exceeded the parameters of just the internet. Valued at about $1.9 trillion, Alphabet Inc., Google\u2019s parent company, ranks No. 1 on Fortune\u2019s 2024 Most Innovative Companies list. Broken into three segments\u2014Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets\u2014Alphabet\u2019s reach spans from Android, Chrome, YouTube, and its Bard AI chatbot under its Services umbrella, to cloud computing under its Cloud umbrella, to private equity fund CapitalG, DeepMind AI research, and Waymo under its Other Bets umbrella. Google Services makes up 90% of the company\u2019s revenue, Fortune calculated from Alphabet\u2019s 2023 fourth-quarter earnings report.\nPage, the eighth-richest person in the world with a net worth of about $136 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has certainly reaped the rewards of Alphabet\u2019s success. With stints as CEO of Google from 1997 to 2001 and 2011 to 2015, and of Alphabet until 2019, Page remains a board member and shareholder of his company, effectively controlling it alongside cofounder Brin.\nTuesday is Page\u2019s 51st birthday, and while he\u2019s another year older and wiser, it was Apple cofounder Steve Jobs who imparted some prescient wisdom about the company\u2019s future, which now boasts the sixth-largest market capitalization in the world.\nPage visited Jobs toward the end of Jobs\u2019 life in 2011 to receive some frank advice from his mentor: \u201cThe main thing I stressed was focus,\u201d Jobs said, according to Walter Isaacson, author of Jobs\u2019 biography. \u201cIt\u2019s now all over the map. What are the five products you want to focus on? Get rid of the rest, because they\u2019re dragging you down. They\u2019re turning you into Microsoft. They\u2019re causing you to turn out products that are adequate but not great.\u201d\n\u201cHe was right,\u201d Page told Fortune CEO Alan Murray at Fortune\u2019s Global Forum in 2015, just days after Alphabet\u2019s October founding. \u201cI mean, he did fine as well.\u201d\nPage did listen to his advice at first, telling employees to focus on Android products and the now-defunct Google+. But the growth of Alphabet suggested the company was poised for bigger things, and more of them.\nAlphabet was designed as a container for Google\u2019s future ventures, even its more esoteric ideas such as glucose-monitoring contact lenses. While Page conceded that Jobs was correct on some level, he also believed that Alphabet\u2019s ventures were interconnected and that energy, telecommunications, and transportation all fit under its umbrella.\n\u201cI always thought it was kind of stupid if you have this big company, and you can only do, like, five things,\u201d Page said in a 2014 fireside chat with Khosla Ventures, taking a jab at Jobs.\nPage and Brin were so certain of Alphabet\u2019s name and purpose that they didn\u2019t even market test it.\n\u201cI wanted to have a name that people would be proud to work for,\u201d Page said. \u201cBut [I] actually didn\u2019t want it to be too catchy because the idea really wasn\u2019t to have a consumer brand in the way that Google is, but really a brand for companies to be part of.\u201d\nAlphabet was a brand for its employees and investors, Page said. But he doesn\u2019t take credit for the name.\n\u201cI chose Google, so [Sergey] chose Alphabet.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

The feature will help train Fitbit users on their personal health by leveraging data collected from their wristbands.Further, the search giant intends to provide AI-powered screenings for tuberculosis, lung cancer and breast cancer in India in collaboration with Apollo Radiology International.

The tool utilizes generative AI to assist clinicians search for information from patient notes, scanned documents and other clinical data. The tool's understanding of medical terminology and specific data points provides transparency and reduces hallucinations.Further, the company\u2019s launch of MedLM, a family of generative AI models designed for the healthcare industry, remains a major positive.

        "Title": "Better AI Buy: Microsoft vs. Alphabet Stock",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman and Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After the launch of ChatGPT, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) emerged as top rivals, and that battle has persisted. Microsoft has aligned itself with ChatGPT parent OpenAI, while Alphabet has sought to challenge its leadership with products like Bard and later Gemini. So which artificial intelligence (AI) stock is the better buy?\nJeremy Bowman (Microsoft): The question of whether to build or buy is a common one in technology, and in generative AI, Microsoft and Alphabet have largely gone in different directions in this regard.\nMicrosoft has tied its fortunes to OpenAI, the ChatGPT parent, through a reported $13 billion investment, and that has enabled Microsoft to essentially use OpenAI's technology as its own. As a result, the tech giant has been able to implement OpenAI's technology in products like its Azure cloud infrastructure services, GitHub code repository, Office productivity suite, and Bing search engine.\nThose moves are already having an impact as Microsoft said that AI added 6 percentage points to Azure's growth in the most recent quarter.\nMicrosoft's diversification also acts as a competitive advantage here. Unlike Alphabet, which makes a majority of its revenue from search advertising, Microsoft has a wide array of products that span enterprise software, video games, cloud computing, social media, and more, and that gives it more opportunities to leverage the power of AI.\nMicrosoft has also been more aggressive in AI than Alphabet has. CEO Satya Nadella has apparently been planning for this moment for years, as Microsoft first invested in back in 2019.\nAlphabet has also been investing in AI for several years, but the company has been more hesitant to release new products, and when it has it hasn't always gone well. The initial presentation for Bard was sloppy and widely panned, and Gemini has been criticized for historical inaccuracies.\nMicrosoft shows no intention of slowing down in AI; it just hired Deepmind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, who also co-founded the recently shuttered Inflection AI. Microsoft stock may be expensive, but it deserves to trade at a premium. It will be hard to catch the AI leader.\nAnders Bylund (Alphabet): I have nothing but respect for Microsoft, but Redmond's finest can't measure up to Alphabet's ultimate long-term planning.\nAlphabet's visionary approach and unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of innovation make it a compelling choice for investors seeking long-term growth. The company's core business -- online search and advertising under the Google banner -- dominates the search engine market. However, Alphabet's ambitions extend far beyond search, with the company consistently investing in cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to reshape entire industries.\nOne such area is artificial intelligence, where Alphabet's research and development efforts have produced groundbreaking advancements. From natural language processing to computer vision, Alphabet's AI technologies are being applied in diverse fields, from healthcare research to self-driving vehicles.\nMoreover, Alphabet's commitment to moonshot projects through its X division showcases its willingness to take calculated risks in pursuit of revolutionary innovations. Projects like Intrinsic, Alphabet's industrial robotics project, and Loon, which aims to provide internet access to remote areas via high-altitude balloons, exemplify the company's audacious vision and long-term thinking.\nLong story short, Alphabet is ready to roll with the punches as the tech market evolves. Furthermore, the stock is much more affordable than Microsoft, whose stock has soared on the wings of its deep OpenAI partnership. You can pick up Alphabet shares at the reasonable price of 6 times sales or 27 times free cash flow today. Double those numbers to get an estimate of Microsoft's ratios.\nIn my view, Microsoft's stock looks overdue for a correction while Alphabet is getting ready to run higher. That's an easy choice.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "Text": "The most recent trading session ended with Alphabet (GOOGL) standing at $137.67, reflecting a +1.67% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a loss of 0.11% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.41%.\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the internet search leader had lost 9.12% over the past month. This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.42% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.7% in that time.\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Alphabet in its upcoming earnings disclosure. In that report, analysts expect Alphabet to post earnings of $1.49 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 27.35%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $65.95 billion, indicating a 13.58% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.77 per share and revenue of $286.48 billion. These totals would mark changes of +16.72% and +11.68%, respectively, from last year.\nInvestors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Alphabet. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.16% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. At present, Alphabet boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nInvestors should also note Alphabet's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 19.99. This signifies a discount in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 29.07 for its industry.\nWe can also see that GOOGL currently has a PEG ratio of 1.25. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. By the end of yesterday's trading, the Internet - Services industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.25.\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 152, this industry ranks in the bottom 40% of all industries, numbering over 250.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nRemember to apply Zacks.com to follow these and more stock-moving metrics during the upcoming trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +4.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +16.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.75 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $65.95 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $290.4 billion and $322.55 billion estimates indicate +13.2% and +11.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAlphabet reported revenues of $72.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.19%. The EPS surprise was +2.5%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That sparked concerns that one of the world\u2019s most valuable firms over the past decade is falling behind in AI, having been overtaken by Nvidia Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.\nCohen said the advantage for Alphabet \u2014 whose stock has dropped 5% this year compared with a 13% gain for the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index \u2014 is that its share price doesn\u2019t reflect its capabilities in artificial intelligence. He believes the Gemini issues can be fixed relatively easily, and that this presents \u201ca rare opportunity for fund managers looking for a value stock with massive growth potential.\u201d\nTypically considered a growth bet and not commonly found in so-called value portfolios, Alphabet was the fourth-biggest holding in Cohen\u2019s Robeco BP US Large Cap Equities fund as of Jan. 31, according to the latest fact sheet.

        "Text": "The euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) played a major in the Nasdaq Composite's 43% return last year. Indeed, investor enthusiasm for AI has carried over into 2024 -- helping fuel the S&P 500 to record levels.\nWhile each member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is playing a role in AI development, several companies in this cohort also share a more specific interest in voice-recognition software. Let's break down the various moves megacap tech has made in speech-powered AI assistants, and assess one stock in particular that could be set for liftoff.\nWhether you realize it or not, you probably interact with voice-based assistants almost every day.\nApple acquired AI-assistant Siri back in 2010 and has since integrated the technology across its ecosystem of hardware devices. More recently, Cupertino bought the music recognition app Shazam for $400 million.\nBoth Alphabet and Amazon have also shown a keen interest in voice-recognition applications, as each company's smart home appliances leverage this technology. Moreover, Microsoft acquired conversational AI tool Nuance a couple of years ago for $20 billion -- the third-largest acquisition in the software giant's history.\nBut most recently, semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia revealed that it has built a small stake in voice-recognition software developer SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN). Following the news of Nvidia's investment, SoundHound AI stock rocketed higher -- the stock gained 347% in the month of February.\nI find this deal with Nvidia particularly delightful because in early January, I predicted that SoundHound AI may be a stock to keep your eyes on in 2024. My thesis primarily hinged on two ideas: voice-based software tools could become increasingly popular as use cases for AI continue to evolve, since voice controls can make AI tools easier to use. Furthermore, the market's appetite for acquisitions could rise this year.\nSince SoundHound AI's trailing-12-month revenue is only $46 million, the company is still quite small. But with cumulative subscriptions and bookings backlog of $661 million, it's clear that the demand for voice-powered AI is rising -- and it's not all coming from big tech.\nConsidering that industry research sees the market for voice-recognition technology reaching $50 billion by the end of the decade, it appears to be early innings for SoundHound AI. While the stock has some momentum pushing it higher right now, this little-known AI company could emerge as a big winner in the long run.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SoundHound AI wasn\u2019t one of them.

The successful hedge fund manager has been selling shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) hand over fist, but he has been buying two other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Tepper slashed Appaloosa's stake in Nvidia by nearly 23%. While the GPU maker still ranks as the hedge fund's fourth-largest holding, Tepper clearly isn't as bullish about it as he once was.\nWhy would the billionaire sell such a big chunk of his position in Nvidia? The most likely answer is its valuation. Nvidia's share price skyrocketed by nearly 240% last year. Tepper could have been concerned, as quite a few other investors were, that the stock's valuation was becoming frothy.\nAppaloosa also reduced its stake in Alphabet by more than 16%. Again, Tepper hasn't thrown in the towel on the tech giant. Alphabet remains the seventh-largest position in his hedge fund.\nValuation probably wasn't the overriding factor behind the decision to sell some of the stake in Alphabet. It's possible, though, that Tepper might have been concerned that Alphabet's revenue from Google Search could be threatened by the development of AI-powered virtual assistants.\nSo which Magnificent Seven stocks is Tepper more enthusiastic about? He added to Appaloosa's stakes in two of them.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) already ranked as Appaloosa's third-biggest holding. In Q4, the hedge fund added another 200,000 shares, increasing its stake by more than 5%.\nIt's not hard to think of reasons why Tepper might have decided to invest more heavily in the e-commerce and cloud services leader. Its profitability has been improving significantly, and Tepper could expect this trend to continue in 2024.\nHe also remains a fan of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). The technology giant held the No. 2 spot in Appaloosa's portfolio going into Q4. During the quarter, Tepper bought an additional 65,000 shares of Microsoft -- enough to boost the hedge fund's stake by nearly 4%.\nMicrosoft continues to fire on all cylinders. The company's integration of OpenAI's GPT-4 model throughout its product lineup appears to be paying off handsomely. Customers are flocking to Microsoft's Azure cloud platform and the AI tools that it offers. Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard also puts it in a stronger position in the gaming market.\nWere these buy-and-sell transactions of Magnificent Seven stocks smart moves on Tepper's part? So far, the verdict is mixed.\nBoth stocks that Appaloosa sold have risen since the end of Q4. Nvidia has soared by nearly 80%, while Alphabet is up close to 6%. Adding to his fund's stakes in Amazon and Microsoft, though, has paid off: Each has jumped by a double-digit percentage thus far in 2024.\nI wouldn't be surprised if the valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft eventually catch up with them. However, any sell-off of those stocks would likely only be temporary.\nMy view is that Tepper -- and other investors -- would be wise to scoop up more shares of all four of these Magnificent Seven stocks on pullbacks. I expect that AI will serve as a major long-term tailwind for each of them.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this internet search leader have returned -4.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has lost 5.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.77 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +16.7%. This estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.75 indicates a change of +14.5% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $65.95 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $286.48 billion and $318.3 billion estimates indicate +11.7% and +11.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAlphabet reported revenues of $72.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.77 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.19%. The EPS surprise was +2.5%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For example, the Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) share price has soared 153% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's even up 6.4% in the last week.\nOn the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\nDuring five years of share price growth, Alphabet achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 20% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Indeed, it would appear the share price is reacting to the EPS.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Alphabet has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Alphabet will grow revenue in the future.\nIt's nice to see that Alphabet shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 44% over the last year. That's better than the annualised return of 20% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Before forming an opinion on Alphabet you might want to consider these 3 valuation metrics.\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results.Moreover, Google\u2019s mobile search is gaining solid momentum. Additionally, strong focus on bolstering generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the near term. Alphabet\u2019s deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind.Alphabet\u2019s strong efforts to gain foothold in the healthcare industry are other positives.

        "Title": "Beyond Market Price: Uncovering Alphabet Inc's Intrinsic Value",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Sign with MA.\nAs of 2024-03-18, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $185.66. It's currently trading at a price of $141.24. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 23.93%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$5.94\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.31%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 21.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n102.56\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n106.93\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n185.66\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $166.94. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 15.39%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) closed the most recent trading day at $133.78, moving -0.31% from the previous trading session. This change was narrower than the S&P 500's daily loss of 1.02%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a loss of 1.04%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 1.65%.\nThe company's stock has dropped by 7.4% in the past month, falling short of the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 3.72% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.64%.\nThe investment community will be paying close attention to the earnings performance of Alphabet Inc. in its upcoming release. On that day, Alphabet Inc. is projected to report earnings of $1.49 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 27.35%. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $65.95 billion, indicating a 13.58% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year.\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.77 per share and a revenue of $286.48 billion, representing changes of +16.72% and +11.68%, respectively, from the prior year.\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet Inc. should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.12% increase. Alphabet Inc. presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Alphabet Inc. has a Forward P/E ratio of 19.81 right now. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 26.57.\nIt is also worth noting that GOOG currently has a PEG ratio of 1.24. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. Internet - Services stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.24 based on yesterday's closing prices.\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 141, this industry ranks in the bottom 45% of all industries, numbering over 250.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share, indicating a change of +27.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.7% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.78 points to a change of +16.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.8%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.76 indicates a change of +14.6% from what Alphabet Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Alphabet Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $65.95 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.6%. The $286.52 billion and $318.66 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.7% and +11.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAlphabet Inc. reported revenues of $72.32 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.6%. EPS of $1.64 for the same period compares with $1.05 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.14%. The EPS surprise was +2.5%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet Inc. is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2234701/alphabet-is-on-sale-will-buffett-buy-shares\nWelcome to Episode #360 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n(0:30) - Should You Buy More of The Magnificent 7?\n(8:00) - If Warren Buffett Buys Apple, Should You Buy Too?\n(32:00) - Episode Roundup: AAPL, GOOGL, BRK.B\n Podcast@Zacks.com\n Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\nThere is a lot of angst on Wall Street about the stocks of Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL this year. Both are off record highs set earlier in the year and neither one is performing like NVIDIA, up triple digits.\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) owns Apple shares. Warren Buffett bought a big position in the company in 2016 and considers it one of the four linchpins of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s business.\nBuffett loves it so much, he gushes about Apple at nearly every Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting.\nIt may be hard to believe today, but Apple was out of favor in 2016 when Buffett dove in. It traded with a forward P/E as low as 10.6 that year. Apple\u2019s 2024 forward P/E is 28. No one is calling Apple a value stock in 2024.\nApple also had a cheap P/S ratio in 2016. The high that year was 2.8 and the low was 2.3. Currently, Apple trades with a P/S ratio of 7.3. It\u2019s not over 10, which is considered expensive, but 7.3 is above the current average of the S&P 500 at 4.2.\nApple also had an attractive P/B ratio in 2016. It\u2019s high was 4.7 and low was 3.9 that year. A P/B under 3.0 usually indicates value. Currently, Apple\u2019s P/B ratio is a sky-high 38.\nBuffett loves companies with great free cash flow and Alphabet has doubled its free cash flow since 2019. In 2023, it had annual free cash flow of $69.5 billion, up from $30.9 billion in 2019.\nBuffett also likes companies that are doing share buybacks and Alphabet announced a $70 billion buyback in April 2023.\nDoes Alphabet have a moat? Berkshire Hathaway looks for companies with competitive advantages of a \u201cmoat.\u201d\nAlphabet\u2019s advertising revenue has been a moat over the last two decades, although some are questioning whether AI might eat into it. But Alphabet also has YouTube, which recently posted its best quarter for ad revenue ever.\nBuffett also likes companies with great management who have been in a place for years. Alphabet fits that bill.\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast for Tracey\u2019s analysis of Alphabet\u2019s valuation. The stock is on sale. But is it cheap enough for Buffett to dive in?\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL in her personal portfolio.]\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 March 7, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ and CBIZ CBZ.\nMany similarities exist between the internet boom of the late 1990s and the AI revolution that is taking place today, including blistering growth, soaring stock prices, and lots of hype. However, significant differences exist as well. For example, Wall Street and the biggest AI winners thus far are already proven companies with massive cash hoards and well-established businesses like Microsoft and Alphabet.\nAt the same time, the AI buildout has buoyed the stock prices of these companies and led to robust earnings, it\u2019s difficult to move the needle on a multi-trillion-dollar business like GOOGL or MSFT. Furthermore, many of these companies have broad and diverse businesses that stretch beyond AI.\nSeveral data points suggest that the AI boom is in its 1995 moment rather than its 1999 moment. For instance, stock valuations are relatively inexpensive (at least compared to 99\u2019), and the Nasdaq 100 ETF is just now breaking out to all-time highs. Still, the most significant divergence between then and now is the IPO market. In 2023, there were 154 IPOs on the U.S. stock market. Conversely, in 1999, a staggering 473 IPOs went public. Quite the difference!\nIPOs, or Initial Public Offerings, serve as the lifeblood of the stock market by infusing it with new, publicly traded companies. These offerings provide opportunities for investors to buy shares in promising, often innovative enterprises, fostering market growth. In the late 1990s, the IPOs provided the most significant gains because many were agile, had blistering growth expectations, and were pure plays in the space.\nObviously, investors cannot change the fact that there are few pure-play AI avenues on Wall Street. Presently, they can invest in the aforementioned dominant big tech juggernauts.\nNevertheless, the best investors prepare for and study non-public companies ahead of time. They watch early-stage innovators early so that they fully understand the industry and can pounce when the opportunity comes.\nAn example of an AI start-up worth watching is Propense.ai. Today, Propense.ai announced a successful seed funding round. The Miami-based company combines AI technology with data science, user psychology, human behavior, and industry insights to anticipate client needs. Propense.ai streamlines the sales experience for accounting and legal professionals by providing them with highly probable cross-selling recommendations for existing customers, making it the first platform of its kind to maximize revenue opportunities for professional services firms.\nIn recent comments, Propense.ai CEO and Co-Founder Timothy Keith said,\n\u201cThe most successful professional service firms are actively engaged in adding service offerings to help their clients, but often struggle with educating their teams on when to offer new services. Propense.ai solves this challenge, elevating client satisfaction while also driving revenue. Behavior is one of the most difficult factors to change in the workplace, especially when sales professionals are expected to cross-sell services they don\u2019t understand nearly as well as their core lines of business. That\u2019s where Propense.ai and its revenue automation capabilities come into play. Using generative AI, accounting and legal professionals can propel new revenue by anticipating and supporting their client\u2019s needs ahead of time.\u201d\nThe best ideas are ones that solve issues. Propense.ai is an example of a company that solves the issue of employee education while adding efficiency and revenue growth. Though the company is still young, it already counts public companies such as public consulting juggernaut CBIZ as clients.\nWhile the AI buildout is in motion, Wall Street and the AI industry have yet to experience the IPO frenzy that took place in the mid-to-late 1990s. Though many private AI start-ups still need to be bigger to enter public markets, I expect that will change in the coming years. In the interim, investors should take the time to investigate and study up-and-coming AI companies such as Propense.ai to educate themselves about the industry and prepare for the eventual influx of IPOs. These IPOs will likely provide the best opportunities because of their industry tailwind, high-growth potential, and asymmetric investment potential.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) minted its first $1 trillion company last year when Nvidia stock rose 239% on the back of incredible demand for its AI data center chips. Nvidia is now worth more than $2.2 trillion, making it the third-largest company in the world behind Microsoft and Apple.\u00a0Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Alphabet (Google's parent company) are also members of the $1 trillion club, and each company is working on AI in its own unique way.\nBut I think AI could soon propel Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) to a $1 trillion valuation, too. It operates industry-leading AI data center infrastructure, and the company is building capacity at a record pace because it simply can't keep up with demand. As of this writing, Oracle is valued at $350 billion, so investors who buy the stock today will see roughly a 185% gain if the company joins the $1 trillion club.\nFounded in 1977, Oracle is one of America's oldest technology companies. It developed revolutionary database management software back then, before helping its business customers prepare for the internet age in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The company created Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in 2016 and has since delivered hundreds of digital services to those businesses to migrate their operations online.\nNow, using Nvidia's latest graphics processing units (GPUs), Oracle is focused on delivering the best data center infrastructure for AI workloads. Three months ago, Oracle told investors it was expanding 66 of its existing data center regions and building 100 more to meet demand.\nChairman Larry Ellison says Oracle's GPU cluster technology allows businesses to develop generative AI models twice as fast and for half the cost of other cloud providers. As a result, demand for its latest Gen2 Cloud capacity is skyrocketing. Oracle is able to keep costs down because its data centers rely on automation, which means there is little difference in operating costs between running 10 data centers and running 100. That also enables the company to build and scale them quickly.\nIn a conference call with investors for the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Feb. 29), CEO Safra Catz said Oracle has at least 40 new AI bookings worth more than $1 billion each that haven't even come online yet.\u00a0In other words, they are waiting for additional infrastructure to be built.\nOracle generated $13.3 billion in total revenue during Q3, representing a year-over-year increase of 7%. While that sounds like a sluggish growth rate, revenue for OCI surged 49% to $1.8 billion, and revenue for Gen2 Cloud specifically (within OCI) grew by 53%.\nWhile OCI only accounts for 13.5% of Oracle's total revenue right now, those growth rates will ensure it becomes a much larger piece of the pie in the near future.\nOracle's total AI bookings across its business topped a record $80 billion in Q3, marking a 29% increase from the year-ago period. As you can see, bookings grew four times faster than the company's revenue during the quarter, which is evidence of the enormous demand for computing capacity the company is struggling to fill.\nAt the bottom line, Oracle's Q3 earnings per share jumped 25% to $0.85, which also outpaced revenue growth. It was thanks, in part, to careful cost management, with operating expenses increasing just 4% year over year. But it was also thanks to a substantial increase in gross profit margin on the infrastructure side, which is a natural consequence of scale. Oracle expects continued improvement as more of its new data centers come online.\nAI is the main point of focus for Oracle at the moment, but there's another opportunity worth mentioning. The company now has two Oracle Alloy data center regions online, which organizations can use to deliver their own cloud services to their customers -- without having to manage the infrastructure.\nOracle has planned five more Alloy data center regions, meaning capacity could soon triple. It's just another example of this company's long-standing commitment to innovation.\nAccording to Wall Street, Oracle is on track to generate $53.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending May 31), placing its stock at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.6. That falls between the valuations of other cloud giants, like Amazon (P/S ratio of 3.1) and Microsoft (P/S ratio of 13.2).\nAssuming Oracle's P/S ratio remains constant, the company would have to generate $151.5 billion in annual revenue to justify a $1 trillion valuation. It could get there within a decade if its revenue grows by 11% annually.\nWhile Oracle is growing more slowly on a quarterly basis right now, its revenue increased by 22% last fiscal year. Plus, Ellison believes OCI revenue will increase by more than 50% for years to come, which could drive an acceleration in the company's top line overall as the segment grows larger.\nRemember, Oracle is in the process of more than doubling its data center footprint, and its bookings just soared by 29% in a single quarter. Bookings are expected to convert into revenue eventually, implying revenue growth will likely accelerate in the near future.\nAI is the greatest financial opportunity Oracle has ever pursued, and I think it's the company's ticket to a $1 trillion valuation within the next 10 years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.
