        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the second-largest holding in my portfolio. Part of the reason why is that I deem it to offer exceptional value whilst also exposing me to the high-growth field of artificial intelligence. While I consider the shares to be well-valued at this time against their intrinsic value, I think there is some opportunity for investor sentiment surrounding the stock to increase as AI becomes further commercialized and adopted around the world.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with CROX.\nIn effect, this could drive up the valuation multiples. Part of the reason I believe this is also likely to happen is that Alphabet's Google could be one of the first major beneficiaries of margin expansion based on the internal adoption of AI and robotics practices more prominently over the next decade.\nIn addition, one of the core reasons I hold shares is that I believe CEO Sundar Pichai manages the company very well, and I think while he operates the business with efficiency, I have noticed he is not ruthless in the name of profits like some other big tech companies. To me, this is very important, as I like to know my investments are helping to support people well both inside and outside of the companies.\nThe tech giant has an extremely strong position in AI at the moment, with its dedicated research division known for its cutting-edge work in machine learning, natural language processing and other AI technologies. A lot of people do not know that Google's Transformer architecture, which powers models like GPT-3, originated here.\nIn addition, Alphabet acquired DeepMind in 2015, which is one of the leading AI research labs globally. It is renowned for its progression in reinforcement learning, where AlphaGo (designed to play the board game Go) and AlphaFold (designed to predict protein structures) became particularly successful.\nAlphabet also has an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google called TensorFlow, which is widely used by researchers and developers globally. In addition, the company's custom-built hardware accelerators, called Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, are designed to speed up machine learning tasks, which enable more efficiency in AI.\nThe company has been very clever in its AI efforts in that it has integrated these developments into its products, including search and advertising, Google Assistant and Google Cloud. In my opinion, these areas are likely to evolve much further in the coming years, and I think we are going to see much more heightened use of Gemini and other AI capabilities within Google Docs, Google Calendar and all other cloud services. I also believe at some point the search engine is likely to iterate toward a heavier emphasis on AI. While Alphabet has been clear that it does not want to remove the links in search, it might need to adapt its current model more rigorously to stay competitive with the likes of OpenAI.\nPichai has also mentioned that Alphabet is reallocating a lot of its workforce, which is going to involve reskilling people because a lot of the old work functions are going to become automated. This is already happening in its advertising division, where significant layoffs have occurred. Many new roles are going to open in AI and machine learning. Therefore, the employees who are willing to start learning these skills now will be well rewarded in the future.\nDespite Alphabet's clearly strong position in AI, it should not be underestimated how much competition there is. In my opinion, there are three major competitors to the company in the field of AI models.\nFirst is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a strong partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and is also developing AI in-house for use within its Azure cloud platform and for integration with Bing. Second is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, or AWS. It has extensive machine learning and AI services, including Amazon SageMaker, which allows developers to build, train and deploy machine learning models. It also uses AI in retail and logistics. Finally, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) performs leading AI research through its Facebook AI Research, or FAIR, lab. It has helped to advanced computer vision, natural language processing and robotics. It also uses AI for content moderation and user personalization on its platforms.\nAWS has much more of a focus on infrastructure for AI model development and deployment and for use internally, whereas Alphabet and Microsoft offer more of a front-end set of services. Therefore, I think Google and Microsoft may end up largely equal in their respective approaches to AI and machine learning over the coming years, with AWS potentially getting larger overall sales due to its development of an ecosystem that supports third-party AI more acutely.\nAlphabet has delivered the lowest compound annual growth rate over the past decade of all four companies. However, I think it should not be underestimated how much more secure the investment is due to its more favorable valuation compared to peers.\nWhat is particularly promising about Alphabet, which is different from Amazon, is that it is not very capital-intensive. This is a result of the fact it is not an infrastructure builder or a warehouser like Amazon predominantly is. As Alphabet generates a significant portion of its revenue from software, its free cash flow growth is much more stable.\nIn my opinion, this stability in free cash flow and less of a need for heavy infrastructure buildouts at Alphabet is going to significantly inform its future share price stability. Amazon has had multiple moments of heavy earnings volatility, which has had a direct impact on the stock price. In my investment style, I favor the investments that offer slow, non-volatile returns over the companies that offer more rapid growth at the expense of short-term stability. Part of what allows Alphabet to command this steady growth is that it is fortunate to have consolidated such an extensive moat through its reputation in software services, primarily a result of its size, which means it also benefits from crucial economies of scale.\nAlphabet has a very strong balance sheet, with an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.72 at the time of writing. Over the past decade, the ratio has been as high as 0.83 in 2016 and even higher at 0.89 in 2009. In my opinion, the company is managed extremely well financially and its structure is a careful mixture of the closed ecosystem approach of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) along with the diversified portfolio approach of Microsoft. This allows Alphabet to keep many of its customers for long periods of time due to them being heavily embedded in its services, but also to develop risk mitigation through other smaller, diversified bets outside of the core Google projects, like self-driving cars with Waymo and Verily Life Sciences.\nIn my opinion, the most appealing part of the investment case for Alphabet right now is its valuation. It is incredibly rare for a big tech company to trade below intrinsic value. However, in this instance I believe this to be the case.\nFor my discounted earnings model, I used Alphabet's weighted average cost of capital, which was 10.57% at the time of writing, for the discount rate. I also estimated the company will deliver 20% annual earnings per share without non-recurring items growth from 2024 to 2034 and 4% annual earnings per share without NRI growth for the terminal stage. The result indicates the stock could be approximately 17.50% undervalued based on this conservative model.\nOver the past 10 years, the annualized earnings per share growth rates for Alphabet have grown from 21.80% to 32.30%. This is a significant expansion, and due to the coming higher utilization of AI internally and the use of robotics in many projects under Alphabet, I believe its margins could expand further, which would likely continue to boost earnings growth even though the company has already well saturated its core markets.\nWe should not forget this model is not all that counts, as increased market sentiment over the long term would also be needed to make the present investment worth the current price. The GF Value chart shows Alphabet to be modestly overvalued, and there is further evidence of this from the expansion of its price-sales multiple from the 10-year median of 6.38 to 7.22 currently and the expansion of its price-to-free cash flow ratio from 29.89 as a 10-year median to 33.51. Its earnings tell a different story, with a 10-year median price-earnings ratio without NRI being 27.28 and its current price-earnings ratio without NRI being 26.85.\nThis calls me to do a discounted cash flow model on Alphabet as well to ascertain whether the undervaluation estimate from my discounted earnings model may be too optimistic. In this case, Alphabet looks more fairly valued, with my estimate of 20% annual free cash flow growth from 2024 to 2034 and my estimate of 4% annual FCF growth for the terminal stage. I retained the discount rate as Alphabet's present WACC. The result is a margin of safety of -2.85%.\nTherefore, I think shareholders need to ask themselves what metric the broader investing public deems as the most important for ascertaining fair value. Free cash flow is considered the best input for a discount model by professionals, but my experience tells me the broader mainstream news and public puts more emphasis on earnings beats and earnings growth.\nTherefore, Alphabet may be fairly valued based on true intrinsic value using free cash flow, but perhaps undervalued when using earnings, a metric more reflective of investor sentiment. Also, the company's earnings could grow more than anticipated with heightened automation capabilities, further elucidating the opportunity here.\nOne of the risks I believe is being overlooked slightly at the moment with companies heavily involved with AI is the negative effects of these technologies, which could become prevalent later on. While each company is doing its best to navigate privacy and security in models and infrastructures, the race toward artificial general intelligence, also known as AGI, is highly competitive. I believe some companies are prone to cut corners to stay ahead. AGI is defined as a superintelligence that can outperform almost any human at any cognitive task.\nThe risk of a fast-growth emphasis from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and other AI players at this time is that if security and misinformation issues become widespread in dangerous ways, for example, surrounding public health, their reputations could be significantly damaged. With AI in particular, I believe the reputation of these companies is absolutely vital to cultivate and maintain with caution. As many people will use AI for jobs they depend on their incomes for, any issues arising within models that negatively affect users' personal reputations may cause extensive user defection.\nAdditionally, the failure to properly integrate AI within search over the long term to provide proper competitive mitigation against other chatbots taking market share from Google needs to be properly understood. If Alphabet fails to restructure its offerings accordingly, I think it is quite possible it will lose a lot of users over the long term to OpenAI.\nDepending on how investors assess it, Alphabet's stock is either fairly valued or undervalued. However, when you factor in the likeliness of higher margins on the horizon from deeper internal implementations of AI and robotics, I think the investment is very likely undervalued at this time. The company's position in AI is formidable, and I believe it is highly unlikely that it will lose its position as one of the leaders in the field over the next few decades. There is lots of stability in the operational model, which includes stable free cash flow growth as a result of low capital expenditures, making the company more secure of an investment than some other big tech companies like Amazon, where the valuation is more largely dependent on investor sentiment to sustain it.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Alphabet, Meta, and Nvidia: 3 Tech Stocks Beloved by Billionaires",
        "Author": "  Bradley Guichard, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's hard to get broad agreement on much these days, as I'm sure we all see heading into election season. But one area of agreement, at least among billionaire hedge fund managers, is that investing in big tech stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is wise. It's been lucrative lately, with Nvidia leading the way, as shown below.\nOf the 16 hedge funds analyzed by The Motley Fool, at least 10 have the three stocks named above among their top 10 tech holdings (as of the fourth quarter of 2023).\nHere are some reasons, so you can determine if they should also be in your portfolio.\nBy diving into its financial results, it's easy to see why Alphabet is a favorite of hedge funds. In 2023, the company produced $307 billion in revenue and $84 billion in operating income. It followed this up with $81 billion in revenue and $25 billion in operating income in the first quarter, year-over-year gains of 15% and 46%, respectively. The 32% operating margin in the first quarter is particularly impressive. But perhaps the best quality is its ability to generate cash flow.\nAlphabet produced $102 billion in cash from operations (CFO) in 2023 and $29 billion in the first quarter of 2024, putting it on pace to smash the 2023 figure. Cash from operations is an important metric because it shows how a company's primary business performs and how much of the profit converts to cash. Since CFO is even higher than operating income, it confirms that Alphabet's earnings are high quality.\nIt's been decades since there was any true challenge to Google Search's dominance. However, the release of ChatGPT and Microsoft's investment in bringing it to Bing were wake-up calls. Since then, Alphabet has answered with artificial intelligence (AI) tools of its own. The company has developed them for years, but they are finally coming to the market.\nGemini is its most advanced generative-AI chatbot yet, able to answer complex queries, assist with coding, and much more. For instance, if you want to update your resume, you can list your experience and qualifications and Gemini will produce a sample resume almost instantly.\nAlphabet's current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 27, close to its five-year average. With its tremendous cash flow and continued growth, the stock is an excellent long-term investment.\nMeta, formerly Facebook, is making a big push to lead the AI arms race. Meta AI is a large language model (LLM) virtual assistant capable of answering complicated queries, solving complex problems, and other functions. It is Meta's answer to ChatGPT and is available on platforms like Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\nAt its heart, Meta is an advertising company; 98% of first-quarter revenue was from advertising. The more users and more time spent on its apps, the more revenue it will make. Meta AI could keep users from leaving the app for rivals, like ChatGPT or Google when looking for chatbot-type services.\nMeta's total revenue hit $36.5 billion in the first quarter with impressive 27% year-over-year growth. Operating income leaped from $7.2 billion to $13.8 billion.\nTiger Global Management appears to be Meta's biggest fan, as 19% of its tech portfolio is dedicated to its stock. Meta's current P/E ratio is slightly higher than its five-year average; however, the average is skewed to the downside by the stock's huge decline in 2022, as shown below.\nThis means the stock is likely close to its fair value. Meta also introduced its first-ever dividend this year. The yield is small now, at less than 1%, but given the company's profitability, it could rise significantly over time. Meta's recent results are terrific, making it easy to see why it is a billionaire favorite.\nNvidia's rise to become the most valuable company on the planet is incredible, and it was built on our endless appetite for data. Nvidia's graphic processing units (GPUs) and software are crucial components for data centers and are even more in demand due to the rise of AI.\nCloud software, data processing and storage, streaming services, and banking all rely on data centers to function. So-called hyperscaler data centers (many over 100,000 square feet) are expected to increase by over 100 annually for the next decade, according to one source, providing Nvidia with a long runway still.\nNvidia didn't disappoint in the first quarter, posting a 262% year-over-year increase in total revenue to $26 billion. Its data center sales exploded again to $23 billion, a 427% year-over-year increase. The 10-for-1 stock split also excited investors, although stock splits have no direct effect on the company's or shareholders' value.\nOf the 16 billionaire portfolios studied, Nvidia is in the top-10 tech holdings of 10, with several having it in the top three. However, new investors in Nvidia should consider the valuation before jumping in with both feet.\nIts current P/E is more than 70. This drops to 47 on a forward basis but still dwarfs Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) own lofty valuation.\nNvidia will have a long, prosperous future, but consider dollar-cost averaging or waiting for a dip to accumulate shares now.\nMost billionaires didn't get wealthy by accident. These hedge funds study data, hire industry experts, and make shrewd stock buys. While investors should not blindly follow their lead, examining their top picks is a terrific place to get ideas.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "For much of 2023, you couldn\u2019t even glace sideways at a media source without mention of the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks. While some of the shine has come off the group as a whole during the first half of 2024, they are still among the best stocks to watch on the stock market today due to their oversized market capitalizations.\nFind Out: In 5 Years, These 2 Stocks Will Be More Valuable Than Apple\nLearn: 4 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks \u2014 Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 still dominate today\u2019s financial news after driving the S&P 500\u00a0in 2023. They account for about half of the weighting of the Nasdaq index, which is loaded with market-cap, tech-heavy companies.\nYou could easily buy stock in all Magnificent Seven stocks in one fell swoop by investing in funds like the Vanguard Growth EFT or Mega Cap Growth EFT, which include high percentages of the U.S. megacap stocks. However, if you\u2019re looking to cash in by owning stock in one of the seven, and are trying to decide between investing in like Alphabet Inc. (Google\u2019s parent company) or Meta Platforms Inc. (the owner of Facebook and Instagram), here are some things that may sway your decision.\nWealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.\nAs The Motley Fool notes, tech behemoths Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are fairly similar: both businesses rule their respective industries by making excellent products, both initiated dividends for the first time this year and both make a killing generating enormous amounts of revenue money through digital advertising.\nWhen dissecting two companies of this size, it\u2019s really easy to sit on the fence. If you believe in the potential of the metaverse and are willing to take on higher risk for potentially higher rewards, Meta might be the better choice. If you prefer a more diversified company with steady revenue from various sources, Alphabet could be a more stable investment.\nHowever, while both companies have vast growth potential and are poised to continue to change the world as we know it from a technological perspective, they differ in the details, and evaluating the direction in which each company may move in the future many dictate where you want to place your hard earneds.\nTrading in internet search engines, cloud infrastructure, entertainment, media, advertising, consumer electronics and mobile operating systems, Alphabet\u2019s main sources of income are YouTube and Google, the world\u2019s leaders in internet searching and online video content searching, respectively.\nIt\u2019s net worth \u2014 or market cap \u2014 is $2.175 trillion today, up nearly 40% year-over-year, per Stock Analysis. And Google stock has beaten its earnings per share (EPS) and sales estimates 100% of the time in the past year, according to TipRanks, making it a \u201cstrong buy.\u201d Of the 38 analysts giving stock ratings, only five have the company\u2019s stock as a hold (none have it as a sell).\nWriting for The Motley Fool, Randi Zuckerberg, former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister of Mark, feels her brother\u2019s company is in a better position than Alphabet to take advantage of the forthcoming AI frontier.\nProviding the world with social media apps like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, Meta Platform\u2019s core earnings drivers are in advertising, the metaverse, consumer electronics and social media. Meta isn\u2019t worth as much as Alphabet, but it\u2019s still got a very well-lined purse.\nIt\u2019s now ranked as the seventh largest company in the world, with a market cap of $1.260 trillion. According to Investors.com, on April 24,\u00a0Meta beat analyst expectations\u00a0by $0.39 in earnings per share ($4.71 to $4.32) and although its executives provided a lighter-than-expected sales forecast for the current quarter, Meta stock remains a good, but maybe not a great, buy. Morningstar thinks it should be selling at $400 per share as opposed to hovering around its current $432 price (Alphabet is ~$176 USD today).\nMs. Zuckerberg is correct about Meta\u2019s favorable position moving forward and Mark is bullish about investing in AI. Meta\u2019s audience is found primarily on Facebook, and in December, the company reported a daily user figure of 2.11 billion and a monthly active user number of 3.07 billion. \u201cFew companies, of any sort, can boast of audience numbers on this scale,\u201d said TipRanks.\nBut with users comes competition, and if more people \u2014 especially legions of young influential people \u2014 spend more time on apps like TikTok, it may come at the expense of people spending time on Facebook or Instagram. Meta will always be fighting for user time and advertising money.\nAdditionally, any hard regulatory limitations or rule changes on how user data can be utilized could turn an audience away. Google\u2019s plan to phase out cookies for 100% of Chrome users by Q3 2024 is already underway and will significantly change the ad strategies of companies that use them, including Meta\u2019s big platforms.\nMeanwhile, Alphabet\u2019s non-internet search AI subsidiaries \u2014 besides the fiasco-filled launch of Gemini \u2014 have already been met with positive reviews. Waymo, the company\u2019s autonomous vehicle has already put self-driving cars on the streets of San Francisco. Alphabet has also developed encouraging Large Language Models (LLMs) that will have far reaching applications for \u201cthousands of small and medium-sized businesses,\u201d according to Laura Martin of Needham & Company. \u201cGenerative AI requires a constant inflow of millions of data points each day to keep an LLM up to date, and GOOGL ingests more data than its competitors, thanks to Search and YouTube,\u201d Martin explained.\nIf you are a hedge bettor, both companies\u2019 AI investment and election year ad spending is going to go through roof, barring a major economic downturn, and both are sound investments. But thinking ahead, Alphabet is a stronger buy of the two. It is cheaper, has healthier consensus upsides and is getting all its sources homed in on the AI revolution better than many of its Magnificent Seven rivals, including Meta.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Places in America To Retire That Are Just as Cheap as Mexico, Portugal and Costa Rica\n10 Best Items To Buy at Five Below for Summer\n5 Moves Every Woman Should Consider Before Retirement\nThis is The Single Most Overlooked Tool for Becoming Debt-Free\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Meta vs. Alphabet Stock: Which Is a Better Investment?\n"

The GF Value chart shows Alphabet to be modestly overvalued, and there is further evidence of this from the expansion of its price-sales multiple from the 10-year median of 6.38 to 7.22 currently and the expansion of its price-to-free cash flow ratio from 29.89 as a 10-year median to 33.51. Its earnings tell a different story, with a 10-year median price-earnings ratio without NRI being 27.28 and its current price-earnings ratio without NRI being 26.85.\nThis calls me to do a discounted cash flow model on Alphabet as well to ascertain whether the undervaluation estimate from my discounted earnings model may be too optimistic. In this case, Alphabet looks more fairly valued, with my estimate of 20% annual free cash flow growth from 2024 to 2034 and my estimate of 4% annual FCF growth for the terminal stage. I retained the discount rate as Alphabet's present WACC. The result is a margin of safety of -2.85%.\nTherefore, I think shareholders need to ask themselves what metric the broader investing public deems as the most important for ascertaining fair value. Free cash flow is considered the best input for a discount model by professionals, but my experience tells me the broader mainstream news and public puts more emphasis on earnings beats and earnings growth.\nTherefore, Alphabet may be fairly valued based on true intrinsic value using free cash flow, but perhaps undervalued when using earnings, a metric more reflective of investor sentiment. Also, the company's earnings could grow more than anticipated with heightened automation capabilities, further elucidating the opportunity here.\nOne of the risks I believe is being overlooked slightly at the moment with companies heavily involved with AI is the negative effects of these technologies, which could become prevalent later on. While each company is doing its best to navigate privacy and security in models and infrastructures, the race toward artificial general intelligence, also known as AGI, is highly competitive. I believe some companies are prone to cut corners to stay ahead. AGI is defined as a superintelligence that can outperform almost any human at any cognitive task.\nThe risk of a fast-growth emphasis from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and other AI players at this time is that if security and misinformation issues become widespread in dangerous ways, for example, surrounding public health, their reputations could be significantly damaged. With AI in particular, I believe the reputation of these companies is absolutely vital to cultivate and maintain with caution. As many people will use AI for jobs they depend on their incomes for, any issues arising within models that negatively affect users' personal reputations may cause extensive user defection.\nAdditionally, the failure to properly integrate AI within search over the long term to provide proper competitive mitigation against other chatbots taking market share from Google needs to be properly understood. If Alphabet fails to restructure its offerings accordingly, I think it is quite possible it will lose a lot of users over the long term to OpenAI.\nDepending on how investors assess it, Alphabet's stock is either fairly valued or undervalued. However, when you factor in the likeliness of higher margins on the horizon from deeper internal implementations of AI and robotics, I think the investment is very likely undervalued at this time. The company's position in AI is formidable, and I believe it is highly unlikely that it will lose its position as one of the leaders in the field over the next few decades. There is lots of stability in the operational model, which includes stable free cash flow growth as a result of low capital expenditures, making the company more secure of an investment than some other big tech companies like Amazon, where the valuation is more largely dependent on investor sentiment to sustain it.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Where Will Alphabet Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Share prices of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) have outperformed the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index over the past three years, delivering gains of 51% as compared to the 26% gains clocked by the index. However, investors might expect more from the search engine leader thanks to the emergence of new catalysts.\nLet's take a closer look at what's likely to supercharge Alphabet's growth over the next three years and see if it can help the stock deliver stronger gains.\nAlphabet finished 2023 with revenue of $307.4 billion, an increase of just 10% from the previous year. Revenue had a compound annual growth rate of 19% between 2020 (when it reported $182.5 billion) and 2023. Its growth dipped last year because of a slowdown in the digital advertising market.\nWhile several rivals reported AI breakthroughs, the setbacks Alphabet encountered in trying to jump onto the artificial intelligence (AI) bandwagon also contributed to Alphabet's performance drop. For instance, Meta Platforms delivered impressive growth last year and cornered more share of the digital ad market by integrating AI tools into its advertising and social media platforms.\nThe good news for Alphabet investors is that it has started 2024 on a brighter note. Revenue in the first quarter of the year increased 16% year over year to $80.5 billion. Net income also increased 61% to $1.89 per share.\nAI seems to be playing an important role, with Alphabet offering improved AI tools to advertisers to help drive better returns on their investments. For instance, the company has integrated its Gemini AI model into its Performance Max (PMax) ad campaigns, and this seems to be driving advertisers' returns. On its April earnings conference call, management said that advertisers using PMax asset generation are 63% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength.\nManagement also said that advertisers using generative AI to create ad components such as headlines and product descriptions saw a 5% improvement in conversions without any increase in costs. The company's focus on bringing AI to its ad tools could pay off big time since advertisers are expected to spend $107 billion on AI-based marketing in 2028 as compared to $15 billion in 2021.\nAI is also giving Alphabet's Google Cloud a lift. Cloud revenue increased 28% year over year in the first quarter to $9.6 billion, with cloud-based AI services gaining impressive adoption among customers.\nAlphabet says that it has added over 1,000 new products and features to Google Cloud in recent months, and this seems to have helped it gain ground. The company's share of the cloud computing market increased by a single percentage point in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis to reach 10%.\nThat might not sound like a huge improvement, but Google Cloud is the third-largest cloud infrastructure provider behind the likes of Microsoft and Amazon, which together control 56% of this market. So if Google manages to claw away share from its rivals, its cloud revenue could keep improving in the long run.\nThe market for cloud-based AI services is expected to generate $274 billion in annual revenue in 2029 as compared to $67 billion this year, according to Mordor Intelligence. And Alphabet has a couple of solid catalysts with its AI-powered advertising and cloud computing that could help its growth accelerate.\nAlphabet finished 2023 with earnings of $5.80 per share. The following chart tells us that its bottom line could increase by 30% in 2024, which would be an acceleration over the 27% growth it recorded last year.\nAnalysts have increased their outlook for Alphabet for the next couple of years as well. A look at the chart above shows Alphabet's 2026 earnings growth is expected to be healthier than its projected rate for 2025. And Alphabet could end up beating the projections thanks to the catalysts discussed. But even if Alphabet's earnings increase to $9.82 per share and the company maintains its current price-to-earnings ratio of 28 at that time, its stock price could jump to $275. That would represent 49% growth from current levels.\nThe earnings multiple used here is a conservative one; the U.S. technology sector has an earnings multiple of 47, and tech stocks whose growth is being fueled by AI tend to command richer multiples.\nSo if Wall Street decides to reward Alphabet stock with a richer multiple, there is a good chance that it could deliver stronger gains over the next three years than what's estimated above. That's why investors looking to buy an AI stock that's trading at a relatively attractive valuation should consider taking a closer look at Alphabet.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Oliver Rodzianko ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the second-largest holding in my portfolio. Part of the reason why is that I deem it to offer exceptional value whilst also exposing me to the high-growth field of artificial intelligence. While I consider the shares to be well-valued at this time against their intrinsic value, I think there is some opportunity for investor sentiment surrounding the stock to increase as AI becomes further commercialized and adopted around the world.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with CROX.\nIn effect, this could drive up the valuation multiples. Part of the reason I believe this is also likely to happen is that Alphabet's Google could be one of the first major beneficiaries of margin expansion based on the internal adoption of AI and robotics practices more prominently over the next decade.\nIn addition, one of the core reasons I hold shares is that I believe CEO Sundar Pichai manages the company very well, and I think while he operates the business with efficiency, I have noticed he is not ruthless in the name of profits like some other big tech companies. To me, this is very important, as I like to know my investments are helping to support people well both inside and outside of the companies.\nThe tech giant has an extremely strong position in AI at the moment, with its dedicated research division known for its cutting-edge work in machine learning, natural language processing and other AI technologies. A lot of people do not know that Google's Transformer architecture, which powers models like GPT-3, originated here.\nIn addition, Alphabet acquired DeepMind in 2015, which is one of the leading AI research labs globally. It is renowned for its progression in reinforcement learning, where AlphaGo (designed to play the board game Go) and AlphaFold (designed to predict protein structures) became particularly successful.\nAlphabet also has an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google called TensorFlow, which is widely used by researchers and developers globally. In addition, the company's custom-built hardware accelerators, called Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, are designed to speed up machine learning tasks, which enable more efficiency in AI.\nThe company has been very clever in its AI efforts in that it has integrated these developments into its products, including search and advertising, Google Assistant and Google Cloud. In my opinion, these areas are likely to evolve much further in the coming years, and I think we are going to see much more heightened use of Gemini and other AI capabilities within Google Docs, Google Calendar and all other cloud services. I also believe at some point the search engine is likely to iterate toward a heavier emphasis on AI. While Alphabet has been clear that it does not want to remove the links in search, it might need to adapt its current model more rigorously to stay competitive with the likes of OpenAI.\nPichai has also mentioned that Alphabet is reallocating a lot of its workforce, which is going to involve reskilling people because a lot of the old work functions are going to become automated. This is already happening in its advertising division, where significant layoffs have occurred. Many new roles are going to open in AI and machine learning. Therefore, the employees who are willing to start learning these skills now will be well rewarded in the future.\nDespite Alphabet's clearly strong position in AI, it should not be underestimated how much competition there is. In my opinion, there are three major competitors to the company in the field of AI models.\nFirst is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a strong partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and is also developing AI in-house for use within its Azure cloud platform and for integration with Bing. Second is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, or AWS. It has extensive machine learning and AI services, including Amazon SageMaker, which allows developers to build, train and deploy machine learning models. It also uses AI in retail and logistics. Finally, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) performs leading AI research through its Facebook AI Research, or FAIR, lab. It has helped to advanced computer vision, natural language processing and robotics. It also uses AI for content moderation and user personalization on its platforms.\nAWS has much more of a focus on infrastructure for AI model development and deployment and for use internally, whereas Alphabet and Microsoft offer more of a front-end set of services. Therefore, I think Google and Microsoft may end up largely equal in their respective approaches to AI and machine learning over the coming years, with AWS potentially getting larger overall sales due to its development of an ecosystem that supports third-party AI more acutely.\nAlphabet has delivered the lowest compound annual growth rate over the past decade of all four companies. However, I think it should not be underestimated how much more secure the investment is due to its more favorable valuation compared to peers.\nWhat is particularly promising about Alphabet, which is different from Amazon, is that it is not very capital-intensive. This is a result of the fact it is not an infrastructure builder or a warehouser like Amazon predominantly is. As Alphabet generates a significant portion of its revenue from software, its free cash flow growth is much more stable.\nIn my opinion, this stability in free cash flow and less of a need for heavy infrastructure buildouts at Alphabet is going to significantly inform its future share price stability. Amazon has had multiple moments of heavy earnings volatility, which has had a direct impact on the stock price. In my investment style, I favor the investments that offer slow, non-volatile returns over the companies that offer more rapid growth at the expense of short-term stability. Part of what allows Alphabet to command this steady growth is that it is fortunate to have consolidated such an extensive moat through its reputation in software services, primarily a result of its size, which means it also benefits from crucial economies of scale.\nAlphabet has a very strong balance sheet, with an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.72 at the time of writing. Over the past decade, the ratio has been as high as 0.83 in 2016 and even higher at 0.89 in 2009. In my opinion, the company is managed extremely well financially and its structure is a careful mixture of the closed ecosystem approach of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) along with the diversified portfolio approach of Microsoft. This allows Alphabet to keep many of its customers for long periods of time due to them being heavily embedded in its services, but also to develop risk mitigation through other smaller, diversified bets outside of the core Google projects, like self-driving cars with Waymo and Verily Life Sciences.\nIn my opinion, the most appealing part of the investment case for Alphabet right now is its valuation. It is incredibly rare for a big tech company to trade below intrinsic value. However, in this instance I believe this to be the case.\nFor my discounted earnings model, I used Alphabet's weighted average cost of capital, which was 10.57% at the time of writing, for the discount rate. I also estimated the company will deliver 20% annual earnings per share without non-recurring items growth from 2024 to 2034 and 4% annual earnings per share without NRI growth for the terminal stage. The result indicates the stock could be approximately 17.50% undervalued based on this conservative model.\nOver the past 10 years, the annualized earnings per share growth rates for Alphabet have grown from 21.80% to 32.30%. This is a significant expansion, and due to the coming higher utilization of AI internally and the use of robotics in many projects under Alphabet, I believe its margins could expand further, which would likely continue to boost earnings growth even though the company has already well saturated its core markets.\nWe should not forget this model is not all that counts, as increased market sentiment over the long term would also be needed to make the present investment worth the current price. The GF Value chart shows Alphabet to be modestly overvalued, and there is further evidence of this from the expansion of its price-sales multiple from the 10-year median of 6.38 to 7.22 currently and the expansion of its price-to-free cash flow ratio from 29.89 as a 10-year median to 33.51. Its earnings tell a different story, with a 10-year median price-earnings ratio without NRI being 27.28 and its current price-earnings ratio without NRI being 26.85.\nThis calls me to do a discounted cash flow model on Alphabet as well to ascertain whether the undervaluation estimate from my discounted earnings model may be too optimistic. In this case, Alphabet looks more fairly valued, with my estimate of 20% annual free cash flow growth from 2024 to 2034 and my estimate of 4% annual FCF growth for the terminal stage. I retained the discount rate as Alphabet's present WACC.

It is benefiting from the robust performance of the Google Services segment, which is mainly driven by Search, YouTube, Android, Pixel, and its first-party web apps.YouTube is playing a vital role in driving Google Services prospects. The company is continuously expanding YouTube capabilities thereby enhancing user experiencePer a 9to5Google report, Alphabet introduced a redesign for YouTube Music on the web. This redesign features a dual-column layout with album information displayed on the left and songs displayed on the right. It also adds a blurred background for a lively experience.Google also bolstered its YouTube Music capabilities with the addition of a new feature that remembers the last played song and allows quick playback. This quality-of-life change retains the docked player and Up Next queue for albums and playlists, allowing immediate playback.Partnerships are playing a key role in expanding YouTube Music\u2019s adoption rate. Alphabet recently collaborated with Garmin GRMN to expand its reach to more platforms.The YouTube Music app is now available on Garmin IQ Connect smartwatches. The app experience is similar to Wear OS watches, with users able to search their library for music and podcasts and a slick playing page with physical buttons for play, pause, and skip.Growing YouTube Music efforts are helping Alphabet capitalize on solid growth opportunities present in the music streaming market, which, per a Grand View Research report, is expected to witness a CAGR of 14.4% between 2023 and 2030.Moreover, these would also aid Alphabet in narrowing down the gap with Spotify SPOT, which holds a dominant position in the music streaming market.Per a Statista report, Spotify retains its position as the leading player in 2023, with its market share based on subscribers being approximately 32%.\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nWhen the AI revolution started with the launch of ChatGPT, investors started pouring money into a handful of companies that are leading AI technology development, thanks to their industry position and unending free cash flows. Market analysts soon started pointing to the concentration of gains phenomena in the market, where just a few stocks accounted for most of the broader market gains. This tech concentration remains strong as of today, as all important AI and Cloud technologies that we see in the news are developed, acquired or marketed by mega-cap tech companies we\u2019re all familiar with. Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett recently said in a report that the S&P 500 has gained about 12% so far in the year, but if we remove 10 technology companies from the equation, these gains shrink to just 3.6%. Hartnett calls these companies the \u201cAI Big Ten\u201d group.\nWhat about the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that kept making headlines in 2023 and early 2024? Hartnett calculated that the broader market gained just 4.9% so far this year if these seven stocks are taken out of the equation. There is a third group of stocks that most investors are unaware of: Hedge Fund Top 30. These 30 stocks include the Magnificent Seven as well as 23 other promising stocks. These 30 stocks returned 53.2% in 2023, 20.2% during the first 5 months of 2024 vs. 11% for the S&P\u2019s large cap index.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) as one of the Big 10 AI stocks that are contributing to the overall market returns so far. The stock has gained about 28 so far this year.\nAnother latest story around Alphabet Inc Class C\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0making waves is Bank of America\u2019s industry checks in the search engine market which found that Alphabet is still the market leader, with a whopping 95% share, with Bing\u2019s search coming in at just 0.7%.\nBofA\u2019s Justin Post said Alphabet Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0AI Overviews had a role to play here:\n\u201cAfter a consecutive eight months of decline, Google\u2019s US Search market share increased m/m in May, which could suggest AI Overviews are aiding query growth and usage,\u201d Post said.\nAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0bulls believe the market is not incorporating Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0April 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 \u2013 showing meaningful progress in the company\u2019s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company\u2019s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it\u2019s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.\u201d\nOverall, Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) ranks 10th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Forget Magnificent 7: Analysts are Talking About \u2018Big 10\u2019 AI Stocks in 2024.

        "Title": "3 Reasons to be Bullish on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "In this article, I will outline three of the reasons why I\u00a0hold a bullish position\u00a0on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock. These reasons are tailwinds in advertising spending, cloud potential, and the stock\u2019s reasonable valuation.\nAlphabet has performed relatively well in 2024, delivering nearly twice the return you would have received by investing in the S&P 500 Index (SPX). This performance aligns with the company\u2019s growth expectations, particularly in its key markets, such as advertising, where AI innovations in Google Search are being incorporated.\nNonetheless, I believe that certain segments, such as the cloud, are overlooked by the market when assessing Alphabet\u2019s future potential. This might be why the stock is traded at reasonably valued multiples compared to other major tech companies.\nAlphabet\u00a0currently holds the title of\u00a0the most dominant advertising company globally, and the digital advertising sector is poised for significant growth in the\u00a0years ahead.\nAccording to projections, digital advertising spending worldwide is expected to surge from $679 billion in 2023 (with 40% specifically in search advertising) to $965 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7%. With Alphabet leading the pack in digital advertising, it stands to reap substantial benefits from this upward trajectory.\nDigital advertising offers distinct advantages over traditional linear advertising. It enables more precise measurement of results and facilitates targeted advertising to specific audiences, rendering it a more appealing option with significantly higher returns from both business and marketing perspectives.\nGoogle Search, with its commanding market share in the search engine sector, and YouTube, boasting over 2.7 billion monthly active users, are pivotal assets bolstering Alphabet\u2019s competitive edge. The incorporation of generative AI features, such as products leveraging LLMs (large language models) to match ads to relevant searches, enables users to find answers to more complex queries and increases usage and satisfaction with the results.\nAccording to Alphabet\u2019s management, the Google Cloud segment and\u00a0YouTube are\u00a0anticipated to achieve a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion by 2024.\nIn pursuit of this goal, the company has committed to investing in infrastructure, especially servers, nearly doubling its capital expenditures to $12 billion in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023. Despite the Google Cloud segment operating at a loss in recent years due to reinvesting all profits into growth, Alphabet\u2019s cloud computing business remains in a growth stage.\nAlthough the segment reported an operating margin of 9% and generated $900 million in operating income in Q1 2024 (see below), this likely has not yet translated into free cash flow, in my opinion (Alphabet doesn\u2019t disclose the segment\u2019s free cash flow figures).\nFor comparison, Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS boasts an operating margin of around 37%. As Alphabet strives to enhance the efficiency of Google Cloud through its investments, achieving margins akin to AWS could result in the company generating billions in annual operating income from this segment.\u00a0This\u00a0would represent a significant source of profit beyond its core search business.\nDespite a 26% increase in its stock price year-to-date, Alphabet maintains a relatively inexpensive valuation compared to its main big tech peers.\nConsidering a consensus that implies roughly 30% EPS growth for Alphabet this year, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23x,\u00a0which is\u00a0the lowest among its \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d peers.\u00a0This\u00a0includes Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which trades at\u00a025x\u00a0and\u00a0is much more discounted\u00a0than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the member of this group that\u2019s trading at the highest multiple of 67x.\nWhen considering cash flows, Alphabet\u2019s price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio over the trailing 12 months stands at 20x, slightly above Amazon\u2019s 19x and Meta\u2019s 16x, based on its $2.19 trillion market cap. Despite this, I still find this valuation reasonably justified. Alphabet continues to invest significantly in growth opportunities, which should drive future expansion. However, these investments negatively impact short-term cash flows, resulting in a higher P/CF multiple.\nRegardless, Alphabet has strong net profit margins (nearly 26%), an effective monopoly in its core search business, and a pristine balance sheet within an industry approaching a trillion dollars in value and continuing to grow. These factors would typically justify a higher valuation multiple, but that is not necessarily the case for Alphabet right now.\nWall Street analysts are extremely bullish about the future of Alphabet stock, with the\u00a0consensus rating\u00a0being\u00a0a Strong Buy, and 32 out of 37 analysts\u00a0recommending\u00a0buying GOOGL.\u00a0The average GOOGL stock price target is $197.67, implying upside potential of 12.2%.\nAmong the bulls, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth asserts that GOOGL deserves a Buy rating due to confidence in\u00a0the company\u2019s\u00a0ability to enhance its products with generative AI technology. This enhancement\u00a0is anticipated\u00a0to significantly boost revenues, supported by the company\u2019s ability to invest in key growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions, thanks to its strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows.\nThere are numerous reasons to maintain a bullish stance on Alphabet that extend beyond just three factors. Still, to reiterate, I firmly believe that the company\u2019s dominant position and its ongoing investment efforts in search will yield significant returns as the industry continues to experience robust growth.\nFurthermore, I find that other segments, such as cloud computing, are still undervalued by the market, and there is substantial potential for value creation as investments lead to even stronger cash flows in the future.\nWhen considering these factors alongside the company\u2019s attractive valuation compared to other big tech firms, I maintain a highly bullish position on Alphabet stock.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "Is Alphabet a Buy?",
        "Author": "  Collin Brantmeyer, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to drive innovation across the technology landscape, investors should consider reassessing how business models might change. Even proven industry leaders like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google and YouTube, could be at risk of losing market share if unable to adapt quickly enough.\nSo, let's look at Alphabet's recent performance, management's new plan to return capital to shareholders, and whether the company is poised for growth or disruption.\nIn Alphabet's most recent period -- the first quarter of 2024 -- the company generated an impressive $80.5 billion in revenue, representing a 15% year-over-year increase.\nBreaking down the company's specific segments, Google Search continued to dominate with $46.2 billion, reflecting a 14.4% year-over-year growth. Google Cloud was also a highlight, generating $9.6 billion, marking a 25.7% year-over-year growth. Notably, Google Cloud was the only division that grew compared to Q4 2023, which is typically the company's highest-revenue-producing quarter.\nAlphabet's Q1 2024 total revenue translated into an operating income -- the profit from core operations -- of $25.5 billion, representing a 46.3% year-over-year improvement. The reduction of Alphabet employees undoubtedly helped the result as its total headcount dropped approximately 5.2% from 190,711 in Q1 2023 to 180,895 in Q1 2024.\nAlphabet's margin expansion should continue throughout 2024 as management looks to \"reengineer\" its cost base. CEO Sundar Pichai added that the company is \"very focused on our cost structures, procurement, and efficiency\" on its most recent earnings call.\nDue to Alphabet's strong financial performance, the company has an immaculate balance sheet, including $96 billion in net cash. Management recently announced two initiatives to return some of this capital to shareholders.\nSpecifically, the company will issue its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to stockholders of record as of June 10, 2024. While the modest 0.46% annual yield may not appeal to dividend-seeking investors, it does leave room for future increases, considering that its payout ratio -- the percentage of that company's earnings that it pays out as dividends -- is only an estimated 12%.\nNext, management recently announced that it authorized a new $70 billion share repurchasing program, which returns capital by increasing shareholders' ownership stakes. The expansion comes on the heels of management spending $61.5 billion in 2023 and $14.6 billion in Q1 2024. As a result of management's capital allocation strategy, Alphabet has reduced its outstanding share count by approximately 4% since 2023 and 11% over the past five years.\nWhile Alphabet's financials are impressive, and shareholders are benefiting, the biggest question mark is whether AI will benefit or disrupt the company's dominance. The topic dominated the company's latest earnings call, with over 40 mentions of AI in management's opening remarks. Alphabet already claims to have integrated AI into its advertising ecosystem, Google Cloud, Google Search, and YouTube, among others.\nCEO Sundar Pichai underscored the recent ramp-up of AI, \"I think for the first time, we can work on AI in a horizontal way, and it impacts the entire breadth of the company ... And we see a rapid pace of innovation in that underlying.\"\nWhile Alphabet states it has been an AI-first company since 2016, outsiders would argue that it was beaten to market by ChatGPT, the transformative chatbot and virtual assistant developed by OpenAI and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Notably, Alphabet axed its initial chatbot offering, Baird, and relaunched it as Gemini. According to PowerDreamer, a website tracking AI stats, ChatGPT's traffic in March 2024 was 1.7 billion compared to Gemini's traffic of 434 million.\nAdditionally, some data suggest that AI language models are already eroding Google's dominance in search. According to StatCounter, a web traffic analysis website, Google accounted for 90.9% of all search inquiries worldwide in April 2024, down from 92.8% in April 2023, translating to a 1.9% decline. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Bing, built by OpenAI's technology, grew from 2.76% to 3.64% during the same period.\nUnfortunately for investors, Alphabet's future is largely unknown when it comes to AI. However, there is no question that it is a priority for management as it continues to pour billions into research and development (R&D), with the company spending $45.9 billion over the trailing 12 months. Notably, competitors Meta Platforms and Microsoft spent $28.2 billion and $39.1 billion on R&D, respectively, during the same period.\nLooking ahead, Alphabet management believes the company has \"clear paths to AI monetization through Ads and Cloud, as well as subscriptions.\"\nGOOG Research and Development Expense (TTM) data by YCharts\nBefore buying any stock, it's essential to look at its valuation because even if it is a great company, overpaying can prove costly for investors. For Alphabet, the company currently trades at a price-to-earnings ratio -- a standard valuation metric for mature companies -- of approximately 26.6, which aligns with its five-year average.\nWhile there are concerns that Google may be late to the AI party and its stock may not be a screaming buy, there's no reason to worry about the long-term outlook for the tech giant, either. Investors would be wise to hold or even add to their position and enjoy the new dividend while the company's AI story continues to unfold.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other cloud computing stocks. You can also check out the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Under $10 here.\nCloud computing has changed the way we access and manage computing resources. The industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Market estimates suggest a jump from a size of $0.68 trillion in 2024 to a projected $1.44 trillion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%. This upward trend is expected to continue, with the market reaching a value of almost $2.5 trillion by 2032. These figures point towards a rising adoption and utilization of cloud solutions across various industries.\nThe growth in the industry is likely to be driven by a number of factors. One key factor is the growing recognition among large enterprises of the impact that cloud computing can have on their operations. In fact, an impressive 94% of companies across the globe have already adopted cloud computing solutions. This high rate of adoption is expected to have a remarkable economic impact, with forecasts showing that it could generate approximately $3 trillion in revenue by the year 2030.\nCurrently, North America and Europe are leading the way in cloud computing adoption, with Asia Pacific not far behind. North America holds the largest share of the global market at 41%. The region's early adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has played a key role in driving its cloud market growth.\nEven with stricter regulations around data privacy and security, the European markets are also displaying consistent growth in cloud adoption. Countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are leading the way in cloud adoption within specific industries. This suggests that European businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of cloud solutions while navigating a regulatory landscape that prioritizes data protection.\nThe Asia Pacific region is also currently experiencing a rise in cloud computing adoption. The market size rose to an estimated $32.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to be a significant contributor to the global cloud computing market in the coming years. This growth can be attributed to a large-scale shift towards digital business models across various industries in the region. The need for cost-effective solutions has fueled cloud adoption among small and medium businesses (SMBs). Approximately 78% of SMBs are currently using cloud services, with 39% of these businesses spending up to $600,000 per year on public cloud services.\nTo shortlist the best cloud computing stocks to buy now, we relied on Insider Monkey\u2019s extensive database of 920 hedge funds as of Q1 2024.

        "Text": "For much of 2023, you couldn\u2019t even glace sideways at a media source without mention of the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks. While some of the shine has come off the group as a whole during the first half of 2024, they are still among the best stocks to watch on the stock market today due to their oversized market capitalizations.\nFind Out: In 5 Years, These 2 Stocks Will Be More Valuable Than Apple\nLearn: 4 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks \u2014 Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 still dominate today\u2019s financial news after driving the S&P 500\u00a0in 2023. They account for about half of the weighting of the Nasdaq index, which is loaded with market-cap, tech-heavy companies.\nYou could easily buy stock in all Magnificent Seven stocks in one fell swoop by investing in funds like the Vanguard Growth EFT or Mega Cap Growth EFT, which include high percentages of the U.S. megacap stocks. However, if you\u2019re looking to cash in by owning stock in one of the seven, and are trying to decide between investing in like Alphabet Inc. (Google\u2019s parent company) or Meta Platforms Inc. (the owner of Facebook and Instagram), here are some things that may sway your decision.\nWealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.\nAs The Motley Fool notes, tech behemoths Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are fairly similar: both businesses rule their respective industries by making excellent products, both initiated dividends for the first time this year and both make a killing generating enormous amounts of revenue money through digital advertising.\nWhen dissecting two companies of this size, it\u2019s really easy to sit on the fence. If you believe in the potential of the metaverse and are willing to take on higher risk for potentially higher rewards, Meta might be the better choice. If you prefer a more diversified company with steady revenue from various sources, Alphabet could be a more stable investment.\nHowever, while both companies have vast growth potential and are poised to continue to change the world as we know it from a technological perspective, they differ in the details, and evaluating the direction in which each company may move in the future many dictate where you want to place your hard earneds.\nTrading in internet search engines, cloud infrastructure, entertainment, media, advertising, consumer electronics and mobile operating systems, Alphabet\u2019s main sources of income are YouTube and Google, the world\u2019s leaders in internet searching and online video content searching, respectively.\nIt\u2019s net worth \u2014 or market cap \u2014 is $2.175 trillion today, up nearly 40% year-over-year, per Stock Analysis. And Google stock has beaten its earnings per share (EPS) and sales estimates 100% of the time in the past year, according to TipRanks, making it a \u201cstrong buy.\u201d Of the 38 analysts giving stock ratings, only five have the company\u2019s stock as a hold (none have it as a sell).\nWriting for The Motley Fool, Randi Zuckerberg, former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister of Mark, feels her brother\u2019s company is in a better position than Alphabet to take advantage of the forthcoming AI frontier.\nProviding the world with social media apps like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, Meta Platform\u2019s core earnings drivers are in advertising, the metaverse, consumer electronics and social media. Meta isn\u2019t worth as much as Alphabet, but it\u2019s still got a very well-lined purse.\nIt\u2019s now ranked as the seventh largest company in the world, with a market cap of $1.260 trillion. According to Investors.com, on April 24,\u00a0Meta beat analyst expectations\u00a0by $0.39 in earnings per share ($4.71 to $4.32) and although its executives provided a lighter-than-expected sales forecast for the current quarter, Meta stock remains a good, but maybe not a great, buy. Morningstar thinks it should be selling at $400 per share as opposed to hovering around its current $432 price (Alphabet is ~$176 USD today).\nMs. Zuckerberg is correct about Meta\u2019s favorable position moving forward and Mark is bullish about investing in AI. Meta\u2019s audience is found primarily on Facebook, and in December, the company reported a daily user figure of 2.11 billion and a monthly active user number of 3.07 billion. \u201cFew companies, of any sort, can boast of audience numbers on this scale,\u201d said TipRanks.\nBut with users comes competition, and if more people \u2014 especially legions of young influential people \u2014 spend more time on apps like TikTok, it may come at the expense of people spending time on Facebook or Instagram. Meta will always be fighting for user time and advertising money.\nAdditionally, any hard regulatory limitations or rule changes on how user data can be utilized could turn an audience away. Google\u2019s plan to phase out cookies for 100% of Chrome users by Q3 2024 is already underway and will significantly change the ad strategies of companies that use them, including Meta\u2019s big platforms.\nMeanwhile, Alphabet\u2019s non-internet search AI subsidiaries \u2014 besides the fiasco-filled launch of Gemini \u2014 have already been met with positive reviews. Waymo, the company\u2019s autonomous vehicle has already put self-driving cars on the streets of San Francisco. Alphabet has also developed encouraging Large Language Models (LLMs) that will have far reaching applications for \u201cthousands of small and medium-sized businesses,\u201d according to Laura Martin of Needham & Company. \u201cGenerative AI requires a constant inflow of millions of data points each day to keep an LLM up to date, and GOOGL ingests more data than its competitors, thanks to Search and YouTube,\u201d Martin explained.\nIf you are a hedge bettor, both companies\u2019 AI investment and election year ad spending is going to go through roof, barring a major economic downturn, and both are sound investments. But thinking ahead, Alphabet is a stronger buy of the two. It is cheaper, has healthier consensus upsides and is getting all its sources homed in on the AI revolution better than many of its Magnificent Seven rivals, including Meta.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Places in America To Retire That Are Just as Cheap as Mexico, Portugal and Costa Rica\n10 Best Items To Buy at Five Below for Summer\n5 Moves Every Woman Should Consider Before Retirement\nThis is The Single Most Overlooked Tool for Becoming Debt-Free\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Meta vs. Alphabet Stock: Which Is a Better Investment?\n"

        "Title": "Alphabet, Meta, and Nvidia: 3 Tech Stocks Beloved by Billionaires",
        "Author": "  Bradley Guichard, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's hard to get broad agreement on much these days, as I'm sure we all see heading into election season. But one area of agreement, at least among billionaire hedge fund managers, is that investing in big tech stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is wise. It's been lucrative lately, with Nvidia leading the way, as shown below.\nOf the 16 hedge funds analyzed by The Motley Fool, at least 10 have the three stocks named above among their top 10 tech holdings (as of the fourth quarter of 2023).\nHere are some reasons, so you can determine if they should also be in your portfolio.\nBy diving into its financial results, it's easy to see why Alphabet is a favorite of hedge funds. In 2023, the company produced $307 billion in revenue and $84 billion in operating income. It followed this up with $81 billion in revenue and $25 billion in operating income in the first quarter, year-over-year gains of 15% and 46%, respectively. The 32% operating margin in the first quarter is particularly impressive. But perhaps the best quality is its ability to generate cash flow.\nAlphabet produced $102 billion in cash from operations (CFO) in 2023 and $29 billion in the first quarter of 2024, putting it on pace to smash the 2023 figure. Cash from operations is an important metric because it shows how a company's primary business performs and how much of the profit converts to cash. Since CFO is even higher than operating income, it confirms that Alphabet's earnings are high quality.\nIt's been decades since there was any true challenge to Google Search's dominance. However, the release of ChatGPT and Microsoft's investment in bringing it to Bing were wake-up calls. Since then, Alphabet has answered with artificial intelligence (AI) tools of its own. The company has developed them for years, but they are finally coming to the market.\nGemini is its most advanced generative-AI chatbot yet, able to answer complex queries, assist with coding, and much more. For instance, if you want to update your resume, you can list your experience and qualifications and Gemini will produce a sample resume almost instantly.\nAlphabet's current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 27, close to its five-year average. With its tremendous cash flow and continued growth, the stock is an excellent long-term investment.\nMeta, formerly Facebook, is making a big push to lead the AI arms race. Meta AI is a large language model (LLM) virtual assistant capable of answering complicated queries, solving complex problems, and other functions. It is Meta's answer to ChatGPT and is available on platforms like Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\nAt its heart, Meta is an advertising company; 98% of first-quarter revenue was from advertising. The more users and more time spent on its apps, the more revenue it will make. Meta AI could keep users from leaving the app for rivals, like ChatGPT or Google when looking for chatbot-type services.\nMeta's total revenue hit $36.5 billion in the first quarter with impressive 27% year-over-year growth. Operating income leaped from $7.2 billion to $13.8 billion.\nTiger Global Management appears to be Meta's biggest fan, as 19% of its tech portfolio is dedicated to its stock. Meta's current P/E ratio is slightly higher than its five-year average; however, the average is skewed to the downside by the stock's huge decline in 2022, as shown below.\nThis means the stock is likely close to its fair value. Meta also introduced its first-ever dividend this year. The yield is small now, at less than 1%, but given the company's profitability, it could rise significantly over time. Meta's recent results are terrific, making it easy to see why it is a billionaire favorite.\nNvidia's rise to become the most valuable company on the planet is incredible, and it was built on our endless appetite for data. Nvidia's graphic processing units (GPUs) and software are crucial components for data centers and are even more in demand due to the rise of AI.\nCloud software, data processing and storage, streaming services, and banking all rely on data centers to function. So-called hyperscaler data centers (many over 100,000 square feet) are expected to increase by over 100 annually for the next decade, according to one source, providing Nvidia with a long runway still.\nNvidia didn't disappoint in the first quarter, posting a 262% year-over-year increase in total revenue to $26 billion. Its data center sales exploded again to $23 billion, a 427% year-over-year increase. The 10-for-1 stock split also excited investors, although stock splits have no direct effect on the company's or shareholders' value.\nOf the 16 billionaire portfolios studied, Nvidia is in the top-10 tech holdings of 10, with several having it in the top three. However, new investors in Nvidia should consider the valuation before jumping in with both feet.\nIts current P/E is more than 70. This drops to 47 on a forward basis but still dwarfs Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) own lofty valuation.\nNvidia will have a long, prosperous future, but consider dollar-cost averaging or waiting for a dip to accumulate shares now.\nMost billionaires didn't get wealthy by accident. These hedge funds study data, hire industry experts, and make shrewd stock buys. While investors should not blindly follow their lead, examining their top picks is a terrific place to get ideas.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $775,568!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Title": "Will Alphabet Be Worth More Than Nvidia by 2025?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock has rallied by more than 40% over the past 12 months and is currently hovering near its all-time high. The tech giant impressed investors with the accelerating growth of its advertising and cloud businesses, a new $70 billion share buyback plan, and the approval of its first-ever dividend.\nThose positive developments somewhat allayed investors concerns about Alphabet's slower progress in the artificial intelligence (AI) market relative to its peers, but it is still overshadowed by Nvidia, which rallied by more than 210% over the past 12 months as the market's demand for its AI accelerator chips outstripped its ability to supply them.\nNvidia also surpassed Alphabet's market cap for the first time this year. As of this writing, Nvidia is worth $3.3 trillion while Alphabet is worth $2.2 trillion. But could Alphabet accelerate and overtake Nvidia again by the end of 2025?\nAlphabet generates most of its revenue from Google's advertising business, which includes its search and display ads, network ads, and YouTube. The rest of its revenue mainly comes from Google Cloud, the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure platform, as well as Google's subscription, platforms, and devices division.\nAlphabet's revenue only rose 10% in 2022 as concerns about the macroeconomic outlook led many companies to rein in their marketing and cloud spending. The company also faced stiff competition from Meta Platforms\u00a0and ByteDance in the advertising market, and it seemed to struggle against Amazon\u00a0and Microsoft\u00a0in the cloud market. But over the past year, all three of Alphabet's core businesses warmed up again.\nMetric\nQ1 2023\nQ2 2023\nQ3 2023\nQ4 2023\nQ1 2024\nGoogle advertising revenue growth (YOY)\n0%\n3%\n9%\n11%\n13%\nGoogle subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenue growth (YOY)\n9%\n24%\n21%\n23%\n18%\nGoogle cloud revenue growth (YOY)\n28%\n28%\n22%\n26%\n28%\nTotal revenue growth (YOY)\n3%\n7%\n11%\n13%\n15%\nData source: Alphabet. YOY = Year-over-year.\nGoogle's advertising business recovered as rising sales for YouTube and search-based ads offset declining ad network revenues. Its cloud growth accelerated as it rolled out over a thousand new products and features, and it continued to expand its Gemini generative AI platform.\nGoogle's subscriptions, platforms, and devices segment also locked in more subscribers. As of the end of the first quarter of 2024, YouTube Premium and Music had reached 100 million global subscribers, YouTube TV hit 8 million subscribers, and Google One surpassed 100 million subscribers. Those expansions should widen the company's moat and reduce its dependence on ads.\nAlphabet could benefit from several tailwinds over the next three years. The macroeconomic environment could improve as the Fed cuts interest rates, which would likely lead to companies spending more money on its ads and cloud services again. The ban of TikTok in the U.S., which will take effect next January unless ByteDance sells its U.S. subsidiary, could drive more users to YouTube.\nBut it also faces tough challenges. It's struggling to make headway in the generative AI space, where its offerings aren't as impressive as those of Microsoft and OpenAI. The upcoming launch of Apple's \u00a0generative AI ecosystem could reduce the amount of revenue Google earns from ads displayed to users of Apple devices -- even though Google pays Apple billions of dollars each year to remain its default search engine. Also, Alphabet still faces ongoing antitrust and privacy probes in the U.S., Europe, and other regions.\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Alphabet's revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 11% as its EPS increases at a compound annual rate of 20%. Based on those estimates, which seem realistic relative to its past growth rates, its stock looks reasonably valued at 23 times forward earnings.\nIf Alphabet meets those expectations and trades at the same forward earnings multiple at the end of 2025, its stock price would have risen 30% to about $228, boosting its market cap to $2.9 trillion -- but that would still be below where Nvidia sits today. Nvidia will also likely keep growing as the AI chip market expands.\nAlphabet and Nvidia are both \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, but they operate in different industries and have different business models. Alphabet is a top play on the digital advertising and cloud markets, while Nvidia is the leader in AI and gaming GPUs. So instead of wondering if Alphabet will become more valuable than Nvidia again, investors should focus on its macro, competitive, and regulatory challenges. If it resolves those issues, it should remain a solid long-term investment.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Omer Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb and in this article we will discuss the activist investor's position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\nBillionaire investor Dan Loeb's hedge fund Third Point had a strong start to 2024 after its offshore fund posted returns of 7.8% in the first quarter chugging along with the broader market's 10.6% gain. AI has been one of his top investing themes for some time now and the activist shareholder maintains his bullish view on the technology. In the first quarter, he initiated a position in Alphabet and also increased his position in Amazon by 22% to about $920 million.\nLoeb's also bullish on the energy transition and one of his favorite stocks that is expected to benefit from the AI-driven electricity demand is Vistra, one of the largest independent power producers and retail electricity providers in the US. Though Vistra's core markets have experienced volatility due to weak domestic electricity demand, the power company's \"capital allocation strategy has been brilliant\", he stated in his Q1 2024 letter to shareholders, seen by Insider Monkey. In the weak demand environment for fossil fuels, Vistra made smart moves by shutting down its unprofitable coal plants and instead buying back 33% of its shares between 2018 and 2023. Additionally, its acquisition of nuclear generation assets of Ohio-based energy company, Energy Harbor, was right on time as governments are turning to nuclear fuel sources to meet the world's growing energy demands. Loeb expects Vistra to be a direct beneficiary of AI-driven electricity demand and is bullish on the company's unique position of holding both renewable and fossil fuel-based assets under its belt.\nAnother AI play Loeb is increasingly bullish on is UK-based stock exchange and financial data company London Stock Exchange Group. The activist investor likes the company's unique market position as a data provider that is democratizing and making financial data accessible to consumers without the use of additional third-party software. He sees London Stock Exchange Group benefitting from generative AI as information retrieval systems in financial services become more powerful. He also expects the company to develop \"a powerful Research Assistant application\" with Microsoft to reduce both human resources and time needed to process financial data. He thinks London Stock Exchange Group is at the forefront of capitalizing on the transition of the financial services industry \"from manual data processing via clunky desktop terminals to machine-assisted data processing\".\nGoogle\nOur Methodology\nWe scanned Third Point\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked growth stocks from the fund\u2019s top 13F holdings. Additionally, we've also added overall hedge fund sentiment, as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNote: All pricing data is as of June 6.\nThird Point's Stake Value: $452,790,000\u00a0\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\nLoeb initiated a position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in Q1 2024, acquiring a stake of nearly $453 million. It's is one of his top growth stocks picks. He likes the company's dominant position across its different verticals including search and cloud, however, pointed out threats to the company's core business (Google Search) due to the rise of answer engines like Perplexity and shifting trends in how consumers interact with the internet. But Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a tech titan and Loeb is confident about the company's ability to protect its profits from competitors by utilizing its expertise in AI, a technology the Google-parent has been working on for over a decade (long before ChatGPT). Here's are some comments from Third Point's Q1 2024 investor letter about GOOG:\n\u201cDuring Q1, the funds made a substantial investment in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) as the market worried about the impact of LLMs, personal assistants, and answer engines such as Perplexity AI on Google Search. We have owned Alphabet in the past and have long admired its exceptional business model and its proven ability to maintain a leading position across an array of preeminent products such as Search, Gmail, Android, GCP, and YouTube.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is among the few companies in the AI scene that has the potential to remain untouchable and unrivaled. Why? Let's talk about this disruptive application that's made global headlines (ChatGPT) which operates on something called Large Language Models (LLMs). It was Google's engineers who authored a research paper called Attention Is All You Need back in June 2017 which laid the foundation for the transformer architecture, the architecture that powers all LLMs today. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has a clear economic moat in AI, with its cloud platform (Google Cloud Platform), research lab (DeepMind), and large-scale data collection and processing capabilities. GOOG has the potential to remain an undisputed leader in an industry that's expected to hit $1.8 trillion by 2030 (as per estimates by Grand View Research).\nApart from that, Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) growth trajectory is remarkable. GOOG's revenue has grown at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 18.6% over the past 10 years and its net income has grown even more impressively, at a CAGR of 20.3% during the same period. GOOG is a blue-chip stock with high-teen growth rates that's currently trading at 23.5 times its forward earnings, lower than its 5-year average multiple of 26x. While there may not be near-term multi-bagger potential to it now, it's a long-term portfolio pick.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on our list.

        "Author": "  Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Believe it or not, but Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) pays dividends nowadays.\nOn the eve of the Google parent company's first-quarter earnings report, its board of directors also announced Alphabet's first-ever dividend payment. The new policy starts with a payout of $0.20 per share, issued on June 17 to holders of Class A (GOOGL voting shares), Class B (insiders only, 10 votes each), and Class C (GOOG shares without voting powers) shares.\nThe policy will continue on a quarterly schedule, and Alphabet seems likely to raise the payouts over time.\n\"We view the introduction of the dividend as further strengthening our overall capital return program,\" CFO Ruth Porat said on the earnings call.\nThe annual dividend yield works out to roughly 0.4% for now. With a total of 12.4 billion shares outstanding, the cash payouts work out to a substantial $9.9 billion in the first year. Moreover, Alphabet added $70 billion to its stock buybacks program. That's up from $62.2 billion of buybacks in 2023, culled from $69.5 billion of free cash flow.\nThe balance between dividend payouts and share buybacks will probably shift over time. Stock repurchasing tends to consume most of Alphabet's free cash flow, and the Google parent will need to make room for the dividend budget:\nSo the company has added another financial mechanism to its tool belt, stuffing cash profits directly into shareholder wallets in a new way. It's a sign of experience and maturity. It was stunning when Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) took this step in 2003, followed by Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) return to quarterly payouts in 2012. Now, the two tech giants are commonly seen as robust income investments.\nAnd now it's Alphabet's turn to join this club of megacap tech titans with active dividend programs.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 8th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0Israel Englander\u00a0is one of the most notable hedge fund managers in America. He founded Millennium Management back in 1989. Today, the fund\u2019s portfolio is worth over $234 billion. Englander nabbed the top spot in Bloomberg\u2019s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2023, with a whopping $2.8 billion in net earnings including gains from personal investments and fees. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Izzy Englander\u2019s Millennium Management earned $600 million from commodities investments last year. However, in a separate report, the publication said despite installing a new chief of its commodities and making big changes, Millennium\u2019s commodities business is lagging behind Citadel (of billionaire Ken Griffin) which made a whopping $8 billion from commodities in 2022. Bloomberg said, citing sources, that part of the reason why Millennium is struggling to post big gains is billionaire Englander\u2019s imposition of \u201ctight guardrails\u201d to limit losses. \u00a0To make money in the commodities business, experts say, you have to take risks and give some freedom to traders. But Englander likes to be in control. \u00a0A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices. Yet Englander owns 100% of the firm.\nThe report said, citing a person who works at the fund, that this major concentration is \u201cnot a good idea.\u201d\nThe FT report said Englander\u2019s fund was up 8.3% in 2023 through October, while it returned 12.5% in 2022,\u00a0 13.6% in 2021 and an impressive 25.9% in 2020.\nFor this article, we scanned Millennium Management\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund\u2019s top 10 holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management\nBillionaire Israel Englander\u2019s Stake Value:\u00a0$820,337,453\nAlphabet Inc.

That's why the stock deserves a deeper look.\nThere has been much uproar about AI stock valuations and how investors are overpaying for mega-cap tech stocks that are promising something that still lies far into the future \u2014 productivity gains, real-life AI products and AGI. But the market doesn\u2019t seem to care what the AI skeptics and naysayers believe. There seems to be no end in sight to the AI-led gains in stocks. And analysts are expecting more. Goldman Sachs's Scott Rubner recently said that he sees a \"wall of money\" heading towards the market. Rubner pointed towards the whopping $7.3 trillion sitting in money market funds and said he believes the floodgates are about to open and investors would funnel that money into stocks. According to Rubner's model, the third quarter of 2024 is when we should expect billions ($29 billion, to be precise) to be flushed into the market.\nOne doesn\u2019t need to have a crystal ball to know where all of those billions would be headed. AI is the promising theme everyone is betting on and that everyone includes experts, billionaires, money managers and long-term value investors.

        "Title": "Here's Why Alphabet Is a Much Better Buy Than Microsoft Right Now",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Although Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is the largest company in the world, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) looks like a much more attractive buy right now. This may seem counterintuitive, as Microsoft has executed at a high level for some time while Alphabet struggled throughout 2023.\nHowever, Alphabet looks to be turning itself around. And with its shares trading at a far lower premium than Microsoft's, it appears to be a much stronger buy. Let's find out why.\nDue to their sheer size, both companies have many irons in the fire. Microsoft Office and the various programs that add on to the platform are critical business tools used by a large chunk of the corporate workforce daily. Similarly, Alphabet's Google search engine is the go-to spot for finding information and generates revenue from advertisements on that platform.\nBoth of their primary products have recently been upgraded with generative AI technology. Microsoft introduced Copilot, which gives its users a digital assistant that can help with formatting, finding formulas, and composing emails. Alphabet recently added a summary feature powered by its in-house large language model (LLM), which succinctly summarizes search results from multiple websites at the top of the webpage.\nHowever, the big difference is that Alphabet completely controls its LLM, while Microsoft has partnered with OpenAI. While OpenAI's ChatGPT beat Alphabet's Gemini (formerly known as Bard) to the punch in its initial launch, the gap has closed between them. Alphabet can fix the LLM in-house if something goes wrong (which has happened multiple times already), while Microsoft must go to a different company to get the fixes it needs.\nWhile this hasn't been an issue yet, having full control over the artificial intelligence (AI) model is a big deal. This is another reason why Alphabet looks like a better buy than Microsoft.\nFrom a financial standpoint, both companies had strong initial quarters in calendar 2024. Microsoft's revenue rose 17% year over year while Alphabet's increased 15%. Comparing net income increases isn't fair, as Alphabet's comparison quarter in Q1 2023 is very weak.\nStill, both companies are growing at a similar rate, making it seem odd that there is a substantial valuation mismatch. I'll use the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to value each stock. This considers what analysts think will happen over the next four quarters, giving investors a forward-looking perspective.\nWith Microsoft is valued at 35 times forward earnings versus Alphabet's 23, Microsoft holds a 50% premium over Alphabet. That means you can control as much of Alphabet with two shares as you could with three shares of Microsoft.\u00a0 As both companies age, this fact becomes more important, as Alphabet's share repurchases and dividends will have a far greater effect than Microsoft's.\nFrom a stock price standpoint, anything less than perfection from Microsoft will result in a stock drop. Furthermore, success is already expected, and just because Microsoft does well doesn't mean the stock will respond. Alphabet doesn't have those same expectations, and its cheaper valuation will allow its business gains to translate directly to the stock price.\nWith both companies executing at similar levels and delivering comparable growth, there are few reasons investors should buy Microsoft over Alphabet. Investing in the stock market can be hard enough; don't make it overly complicated by buying shares priced for perfection like Microsoft's.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Where Will Alphabet Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Share prices of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) have outperformed the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index over the past three years, delivering gains of 51% as compared to the 26% gains clocked by the index. However, investors might expect more from the search engine leader thanks to the emergence of new catalysts.\nLet's take a closer look at what's likely to supercharge Alphabet's growth over the next three years and see if it can help the stock deliver stronger gains.\nAlphabet finished 2023 with revenue of $307.4 billion, an increase of just 10% from the previous year. Revenue had a compound annual growth rate of 19% between 2020 (when it reported $182.5 billion) and 2023. Its growth dipped last year because of a slowdown in the digital advertising market.\nWhile several rivals reported AI breakthroughs, the setbacks Alphabet encountered in trying to jump onto the artificial intelligence (AI) bandwagon also contributed to Alphabet's performance drop. For instance, Meta Platforms delivered impressive growth last year and cornered more share of the digital ad market by integrating AI tools into its advertising and social media platforms.\nThe good news for Alphabet investors is that it has started 2024 on a brighter note. Revenue in the first quarter of the year increased 16% year over year to $80.5 billion. Net income also increased 61% to $1.89 per share.\nAI seems to be playing an important role, with Alphabet offering improved AI tools to advertisers to help drive better returns on their investments. For instance, the company has integrated its Gemini AI model into its Performance Max (PMax) ad campaigns, and this seems to be driving advertisers' returns. On its April earnings conference call, management said that advertisers using PMax asset generation are 63% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength.\nManagement also said that advertisers using generative AI to create ad components such as headlines and product descriptions saw a 5% improvement in conversions without any increase in costs. The company's focus on bringing AI to its ad tools could pay off big time since advertisers are expected to spend $107 billion on AI-based marketing in 2028 as compared to $15 billion in 2021.\nAI is also giving Alphabet's Google Cloud a lift. Cloud revenue increased 28% year over year in the first quarter to $9.6 billion, with cloud-based AI services gaining impressive adoption among customers.\nAlphabet says that it has added over 1,000 new products and features to Google Cloud in recent months, and this seems to have helped it gain ground. The company's share of the cloud computing market increased by a single percentage point in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis to reach 10%.\nThat might not sound like a huge improvement, but Google Cloud is the third-largest cloud infrastructure provider behind the likes of Microsoft and Amazon, which together control 56% of this market. So if Google manages to claw away share from its rivals, its cloud revenue could keep improving in the long run.\nThe market for cloud-based AI services is expected to generate $274 billion in annual revenue in 2029 as compared to $67 billion this year, according to Mordor Intelligence. And Alphabet has a couple of solid catalysts with its AI-powered advertising and cloud computing that could help its growth accelerate.\nAlphabet finished 2023 with earnings of $5.80 per share. The following chart tells us that its bottom line could increase by 30% in 2024, which would be an acceleration over the 27% growth it recorded last year.\nAnalysts have increased their outlook for Alphabet for the next couple of years as well. A look at the chart above shows Alphabet's 2026 earnings growth is expected to be healthier than its projected rate for 2025. And Alphabet could end up beating the projections thanks to the catalysts discussed. But even if Alphabet's earnings increase to $9.82 per share and the company maintains its current price-to-earnings ratio of 28 at that time, its stock price could jump to $275. That would represent 49% growth from current levels.\nThe earnings multiple used here is a conservative one; the U.S. technology sector has an earnings multiple of 47, and tech stocks whose growth is being fueled by AI tend to command richer multiples.\nSo if Wall Street decides to reward Alphabet stock with a richer multiple, there is a good chance that it could deliver stronger gains over the next three years than what's estimated above. That's why investors looking to buy an AI stock that's trading at a relatively attractive valuation should consider taking a closer look at Alphabet.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

Between the two, they own a 6% stake in the megacap tech giant.\nBeyond those two, Eric Schmidt, who served as CEO from 2001 to 2011, owns a 0.5% stake, worth about $11 billion. But there are some other well-known large shareholders, and some that are less apparent.\nAccording to regulatory filings, the largest owners of Alphabet stock are companies that operate index funds -- specifically Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. Vanguard, the largest shareholder, owns about 7.3%, and the others own a little less.\nThis is quite common among public companies. For example, and index-tracking fund like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF must hold Alphabet shares in the proportion it is weighted in the index it follows.\nAs far as individual investors go, early Alphabet investors L. John Doerr and K. Ram Shriram, both of whom are Alphabet board members, own 0.2% and 0.02%, respectively.\nIt's also worth noting that there is a lot about the ownership structure of Alphabet (and most other public companies for that matter) that is more difficult to pin down.\nSpecifically, we only know how many shares individual investors own if they fall into one or more of these categories:\nThey are a key executive or director of the business.\nThey own more than 5% of a class of common stock.\nThey are a hedge fund manager or are otherwise required to disclose their holdings in a 13-F filing.\nThey have chosen to make their investment publicly known, or otherwise have their investment revealed to the public.\nIn other words, a wealthy individual could own 1% of Alphabet's stock, which would make them the third-largest individual shareholder behind Page and Brin, and the public could have no idea about it.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL shares have rallied 25.4% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 19.4%. The company is benefiting from a strong Google Services segment driven by search, YouTube and Android.Alphabet\u2019s division Google is making concerted efforts to bolster the segment further.Recently, Google introduced a new Notifications feature for one of its Android apps, Google Wallet. The Wallet app now has six notification categories, namely Tips, Purchases, Passes, Transit, Updates & Alerts, and Promotional Campaigns, allowing users to receive transaction notifications from Google Wallet directly instead of Google Play services.The rollout of a new \u201cAutomatically add linked passes\u201d feature to Google Wallet remains noteworthy. This new feature is an addition to the \"Passes\" sub-section in Google Wallet settings on Android. It allows providers to automatically add event tickets, promotions and offers to existing passes.Growing Wallet app offerings on Android would allow Google to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the global digital wallet market, which, per The Business Research Company report, is expected to hit $47.7 billion in 2024 and reach $97.54 billion by 2033, witnessing a CAGR of 19.6% between 2024 and 2033.Moreover, it would also place Alphabet at a competitive advantage over industry peers like Microsoft MSFT and Apple AAPL, which are also making strong efforts to strengthen their foothold in the global digital wallet market.Microsoft\u2019s addition of a cryptocurrency wallet to its Edge Wallet remains noteworthy. This feature provides real-time updates on cryptocurrency value fluctuations and logging transactions for effective monitoring.Apple, on the other hand, is enjoying the growing momentum of Apple Wallet with the addition of new features. Its Apple Pay orders can now be attached to receipts as PDF or image files, allowing customers to track payment in the Wallet app and to confirmation emails.\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\nAlphabet has been taking continuous strides to boost its search and YouTube businesses in addition to Android, in a bid to strengthen its Google Services segment.Google recently rolled out \u201cMinimized Custom Tabs\u201d for Google Chrome to improve the user experience and functionality of the Chrome browser, which, in turn, will likely boost the company's search engine.Alphabet\u2019s latest Cast menu redesign of YouTube is expected to expand YouTube\u2019s user base. The updated Cast icon now features a floating bottom sheet with rounded corners, allowing users to control volume and voice search, and also provides remote control options for televisions.In order to strengthen its YouTube business further, Google recently partnered with Peloton Interactive PTON.This partnership marks a significant step for Google to expand its YouTube TV subscriber base, as it requires Peloton All-Access members to have a YouTube TV subscription in order to watch content while on their machine.These efforts are expected to benefit the Google Services segment performance in the upcoming period.The strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid Alphabet\u2019s overall financial performance in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $295.53 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.2%.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure has been revised upward by 0.4% in the past 30 days.\nWe believe Alphabet\u2019s strength in the Google Services Segment, coupled with its robust cloud division, growing momentum across Google\u2019s mobile search and strengthening generative AI capabilities, make it an attractive stock for investors at the current level.Alphabet is trading at a discount with a forward 12-month P/E of 21.74X compared with the Zacks Internet Services industry\u2019s 22.40X.The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Growth Score of B, a combination that offers a good investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology.

        "Title": "Could Alphabet Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's no denying that Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has been one of the best businesses that investors could've owned historically. Since its initial public offering in August 2004,\u00a0shares have skyrocketed 6,300%. This means that a $15,000 investment back then would be worth a little over $400,000 today.\nBut if you missed the boat, you're probably wondering if a repeat performance is on the horizon. Could this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock help you one day become a millionaire?\nFrom its founding in 1998 to today, Alphabet has become one of the world's leading tech enterprises. It owns popular internet properties that are used by hundreds of millions and even billions of people on a daily basis, including its search engine, Gmail, Maps, and YouTube.\nThe advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has many people thinking that disruptions will happen to Alphabet's dominance, particularly when it comes to Google Search, the company's crown jewel segment. If AI tools can create answers to queries, then perhaps people won't need to scroll through links to find what they're looking for, something that could undermine Alphabet's ad business.\nBut there's no reason for investors to worry about Search losing its leading industry position anytime soon. It's likely to still be the main way that people access information years from now. And that usage will keep Alphabet as one of the top digital advertising businesses on the planet. For what it's worth, Google Search still has a 91% share of the global search market.\nAlphabet generated $307 billion in revenue in 2023. That's a gargantuan sum that makes this one of the largest companies out there. But investors should know that growth is still a key part of the story. Sales last year were up 9%, versus 2022, and 125% higher than in 2018.\nBetween 2023 and 2026, consensus analyst estimates call for revenue to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4%. That would be a wonderful outcome, driven by growth in the digital ad, cloud computing, and streaming markets, and Alphabet has a strong presence in all of them.\nInvestors will be happy to know that this is a financially sound business. There's no problem when it comes to generating profits, as Alphabet's operating margin has averaged a superb 26.2% in the last five years. Thanks to cost-cutting measures, the Q1 2024 margin is up meaningfully from the year-ago period.\nIn addition to the strong bottom line, Alphabet's balance sheet also reduces financial risk. This is something that should be prioritized when looking for long-term investment candidates.\nAs of March 31, the business had $13 billion of long-term debt on the books. That might seem like a lot on its own, but when compared to the company's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $108 billion, it's clear that Alphabet is in pristine financial shape. There are no reasons to worry that the business will ever run into trouble on that front.\nTo be clear, investors shouldn't expect forward returns to come anywhere close to resembling the past. Alphabet is a more mature company these days than in its early days, so naturally, its expansionary runway isn't as large.\nHowever, this is still a smart stock to buy, especially since it trades at a compelling forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.7. Investors who are able to put in a lot more capital upfront when buying shares have a greater shot at becoming millionaires from Alphabet. Additionally, it helps if you have a much longer time horizon, as this helps allow the power of compounding to work.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $767,173!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The outperformance can be attributed to the strong performance of the Google Services segment, which is mainly driven by Search, YouTube, Android, Pixel and its first-party web apps.A strong product portfolio and an expanding partner base are key growth drivers of the Google Services segment, which contributes to the majority of Alphabet\u2019s total revenues.In the first quarter of 2024, revenues from the Google Services business increased 13.6% year over year to $70.4 billion, accounting for 87.4% of total revenues.Alphabet\u2019s division, Google, is making concerted efforts to strengthen this segment further on the back of feature upgrades for its first-party web apps in order to increase their adoption among users.In this regard, Google\u2019s implementation of a Material 3 redesign for one of its first-party web apps, Google Photos, remains noteworthy. The redesign has placed Google Photos\u2019 core gallery in an internal container with a white background, while navigation, search bar and navigation drawer are placed on a light blue background.Earlier, Alphabet also introduced a Material 3 redesign for the Google Pay web application to offer features like viewing payment methods saved to users\u2019 accounts and allowing users to see their recent transactions by tapping on a card.Alphabet is also making feature additions to bolster its search, Android, YouTube and Pixel product portfolio.\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\nAlphabet\u2019s latest addition of a \u201cListen to this page\u201d text-to-speech feature on Google Chrome testifies to the aforesaid fact.This feature strives to improve the user experience and functionality of the Chrome browser, which, in turn, will likely boost the company's search engine.Alphabet boosted its Android offerings with the roll-out of a new Google Maps feature that shows entrances for buildings to some select users, addressing the issue of navigating to specific building portions on the map.This feature addition is aimed at improving the user experience for Android users by ensuring accurate directions for businesses or locations.Google also strengthened its Pixel portfolio with the launch of a \u201cLookup\u201d reverse number shortcut feature on the Google Phone app for all Pixel devices. The shortcut feature, present in the Recents tab, will open Google Search with the number, including country code, placed in parentheses when users tap on it to expand an unsaved incoming call.Expanding partner base has also been a catalyst to the Google Services segment\u2019s performance.Google partnered with Peloton Interactive PTON to strengthen its YouTube business. This partnership marks a significant step for Google to expand its YouTube TV subscriber base, as it requires Peloton All-Access members to have a YouTube TV subscription in order to watch content while on their machine.These efforts are expected to accelerate daily user activity on Search, YouTube, Android, Pixel and first-party web apps in the Google Services segment, which, in turn, is expected to drive Alphabet\u2019s overall financial performance in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $291.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.6%.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure.

        "Author": "  Fahad Saleem ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 9 Best Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire George Soros. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks higher in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0George Soros\u00a0has been one of the most active and divisive figures in the Wall Street. Often a right-wing target, the billionaire handed over the control of his $25 billion empire to his son Alexander Soros last year. The 93 year-old Hungarian American is known as the philosopher investor in the Wall Street, mainly due to his contributions to philosophy and his deep desire to leave his mark in the world of philosophy, which many believe he fulfilled thanks to his General Theory of Reflexivity for capital markets.\nGeorge Soros founded Soros Fund Management in 1970. Since its inception through 2010, the fund posted on average a 20% annual rate of return. A Wall Street Journal report earlier this year said that Soros Fund Management has posted a compound annual return of 13.5% over the past three years through June 30, 2023.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones\u2019 Top Dividend Picks\u00a0and\u00a0Analysts Are Upgrading These AI Stocks\nGeorge Soros in his book\u00a0The New Paradigm of Financial Markets\u00a0wrote a chapter titled \u201cAutobiography of a Failed Philosopher\u201d in which he talked in detail about how many, including his son and his biographer, started accepting the idea that Soros was a failed philosopher. \u00a0Soros talks in detail about his childhood, his relationship with his father who at one point, according to Soros, lost all ambition in life and did not amass any wealth. A Jew by birth, Soros decided to come to the UK after the Nazi occupation of Hungary. Soros\u2019 first interactions with philosophy started when he was impressed by the works of Karl Popper. But Soros\u2019 dreams of creating a career in philosophy could not realize for several reasons, some of which he talks about in his book:\n\u201cI would have preferred to stay within the safe walls of academe\u2014I even had a teaching assistant job prospect at the University of Michigan in Kalamazoo, but my grades were not good enough, and I was forced to go out into the real world. After several false starts, I ended up working as an arbitrage trader, first in London and then in New York.* At first I had to forget everything I had learned as a student in order to hold down my job, but eventually my college education came in very useful. In particular, I could apply my theory of reflexivity to establish a disequilibrium scenario or boom-bust pattern for financial markets. The rewarding part came when markets entered what I called far-from-equilibrium territory because that is when the generally accepted equilibrium models broke down.\u201d\nFor this article we scanned Billionaire Soros\u2019s Soros Fund Management\u2019s Q1 portfolio and chose its top 9 stock picks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nBillionaire George Soros\u2019s\u00a0Q1\u20192024 Stake Value:\u00a0$224,976,107\nBillionaire George Soros increased his hold in Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0by 23% in the first quarter, ending the quarter with a $225 million stake in Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). Analysts are deeply divided over Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG), as some believe the AI revolution is a threat to Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0dominance in the search market, which is its bread and butter as it accounts for over 90% of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0total revenue. Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0bulls believe Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrate with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0app is to urge users to sign up for \u2018Google One AI Premium\u2019 plan, which has a $19.99 price tag. \u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\nAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0bulls believe the market is not incorporating Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a02025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis.\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0April 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 \u2013 showing meaningful progress in the company\u2019s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company\u2019s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it\u2019s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc.

        "Title": "Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space",
        "Author": "  Oliver Rodzianko ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the second-largest holding in my portfolio. Part of the reason why is that I deem it to offer exceptional value whilst also exposing me to the high-growth field of artificial intelligence. While I consider the shares to be well-valued at this time against their intrinsic value, I think there is some opportunity for investor sentiment surrounding the stock to increase as AI becomes further commercialized and adopted around the world.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with CROX.\nIn effect, this could drive up the valuation multiples. Part of the reason I believe this is also likely to happen is that Alphabet's Google could be one of the first major beneficiaries of margin expansion based on the internal adoption of AI and robotics practices more prominently over the next decade.\nIn addition, one of the core reasons I hold shares is that I believe CEO Sundar Pichai manages the company very well, and I think while he operates the business with efficiency, I have noticed he is not ruthless in the name of profits like some other big tech companies. To me, this is very important, as I like to know my investments are helping to support people well both inside and outside of the companies.\nThe tech giant has an extremely strong position in AI at the moment, with its dedicated research division known for its cutting-edge work in machine learning, natural language processing and other AI technologies. A lot of people do not know that Google's Transformer architecture, which powers models like GPT-3, originated here.\nIn addition, Alphabet acquired DeepMind in 2015, which is one of the leading AI research labs globally. It is renowned for its progression in reinforcement learning, where AlphaGo (designed to play the board game Go) and AlphaFold (designed to predict protein structures) became particularly successful.\nAlphabet also has an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google called TensorFlow, which is widely used by researchers and developers globally. In addition, the company's custom-built hardware accelerators, called Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, are designed to speed up machine learning tasks, which enable more efficiency in AI.\nThe company has been very clever in its AI efforts in that it has integrated these developments into its products, including search and advertising, Google Assistant and Google Cloud. In my opinion, these areas are likely to evolve much further in the coming years, and I think we are going to see much more heightened use of Gemini and other AI capabilities within Google Docs, Google Calendar and all other cloud services. I also believe at some point the search engine is likely to iterate toward a heavier emphasis on AI. While Alphabet has been clear that it does not want to remove the links in search, it might need to adapt its current model more rigorously to stay competitive with the likes of OpenAI.\nPichai has also mentioned that Alphabet is reallocating a lot of its workforce, which is going to involve reskilling people because a lot of the old work functions are going to become automated. This is already happening in its advertising division, where significant layoffs have occurred. Many new roles are going to open in AI and machine learning. Therefore, the employees who are willing to start learning these skills now will be well rewarded in the future.\nDespite Alphabet's clearly strong position in AI, it should not be underestimated how much competition there is. In my opinion, there are three major competitors to the company in the field of AI models.\nFirst is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a strong partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and is also developing AI in-house for use within its Azure cloud platform and for integration with Bing. Second is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, or AWS. It has extensive machine learning and AI services, including Amazon SageMaker, which allows developers to build, train and deploy machine learning models. It also uses AI in retail and logistics. Finally, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) performs leading AI research through its Facebook AI Research, or FAIR, lab. It has helped to advanced computer vision, natural language processing and robotics. It also uses AI for content moderation and user personalization on its platforms.\nAWS has much more of a focus on infrastructure for AI model development and deployment and for use internally, whereas Alphabet and Microsoft offer more of a front-end set of services. Therefore, I think Google and Microsoft may end up largely equal in their respective approaches to AI and machine learning over the coming years, with AWS potentially getting larger overall sales due to its development of an ecosystem that supports third-party AI more acutely.\nAlphabet has delivered the lowest compound annual growth rate over the past decade of all four companies. However, I think it should not be underestimated how much more secure the investment is due to its more favorable valuation compared to peers.\nWhat is particularly promising about Alphabet, which is different from Amazon, is that it is not very capital-intensive. This is a result of the fact it is not an infrastructure builder or a warehouser like Amazon predominantly is. As Alphabet generates a significant portion of its revenue from software, its free cash flow growth is much more stable.\nIn my opinion, this stability in free cash flow and less of a need for heavy infrastructure buildouts at Alphabet is going to significantly inform its future share price stability. Amazon has had multiple moments of heavy earnings volatility, which has had a direct impact on the stock price. In my investment style, I favor the investments that offer slow, non-volatile returns over the companies that offer more rapid growth at the expense of short-term stability. Part of what allows Alphabet to command this steady growth is that it is fortunate to have consolidated such an extensive moat through its reputation in software services, primarily a result of its size, which means it also benefits from crucial economies of scale.\nAlphabet has a very strong balance sheet, with an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.72 at the time of writing. Over the past decade, the ratio has been as high as 0.83 in 2016 and even higher at 0.89 in 2009. In my opinion, the company is managed extremely well financially and its structure is a careful mixture of the closed ecosystem approach of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) along with the diversified portfolio approach of Microsoft. This allows Alphabet to keep many of its customers for long periods of time due to them being heavily embedded in its services, but also to develop risk mitigation through other smaller, diversified bets outside of the core Google projects, like self-driving cars with Waymo and Verily Life Sciences.\nIn my opinion, the most appealing part of the investment case for Alphabet right now is its valuation. It is incredibly rare for a big tech company to trade below intrinsic value. However, in this instance I believe this to be the case.\nFor my discounted earnings model, I used Alphabet's weighted average cost of capital, which was 10.57% at the time of writing, for the discount rate. I also estimated the company will deliver 20% annual earnings per share without non-recurring items growth from 2024 to 2034 and 4% annual earnings per share without NRI growth for the terminal stage. The result indicates the stock could be approximately 17.50% undervalued based on this conservative model.\nOver the past 10 years, the annualized earnings per share growth rates for Alphabet have grown from 21.80% to 32.30%. This is a significant expansion, and due to the coming higher utilization of AI internally and the use of robotics in many projects under Alphabet, I believe its margins could expand further, which would likely continue to boost earnings growth even though the company has already well saturated its core markets.\nWe should not forget this model is not all that counts, as increased market sentiment over the long term would also be needed to make the present investment worth the current price. The GF Value chart shows Alphabet to be modestly overvalued, and there is further evidence of this from the expansion of its price-sales multiple from the 10-year median of 6.38 to 7.22 currently and the expansion of its price-to-free cash flow ratio from 29.89 as a 10-year median to 33.51. Its earnings tell a different story, with a 10-year median price-earnings ratio without NRI being 27.28 and its current price-earnings ratio without NRI being 26.85.\nThis calls me to do a discounted cash flow model on Alphabet as well to ascertain whether the undervaluation estimate from my discounted earnings model may be too optimistic. In this case, Alphabet looks more fairly valued, with my estimate of 20% annual free cash flow growth from 2024 to 2034 and my estimate of 4% annual FCF growth for the terminal stage. I retained the discount rate as Alphabet's present WACC. The result is a margin of safety of -2.85%.\nTherefore, I think shareholders need to ask themselves what metric the broader investing public deems as the most important for ascertaining fair value. Free cash flow is considered the best input for a discount model by professionals, but my experience tells me the broader mainstream news and public puts more emphasis on earnings beats and earnings growth.\nTherefore, Alphabet may be fairly valued based on true intrinsic value using free cash flow, but perhaps undervalued when using earnings, a metric more reflective of investor sentiment. Also, the company's earnings could grow more than anticipated with heightened automation capabilities, further elucidating the opportunity here.\nOne of the risks I believe is being overlooked slightly at the moment with companies heavily involved with AI is the negative effects of these technologies, which could become prevalent later on. While each company is doing its best to navigate privacy and security in models and infrastructures, the race toward artificial general intelligence, also known as AGI, is highly competitive. I believe some companies are prone to cut corners to stay ahead. AGI is defined as a superintelligence that can outperform almost any human at any cognitive task.\nThe risk of a fast-growth emphasis from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and other AI players at this time is that if security and misinformation issues become widespread in dangerous ways, for example, surrounding public health, their reputations could be significantly damaged. With AI in particular, I believe the reputation of these companies is absolutely vital to cultivate and maintain with caution. As many people will use AI for jobs they depend on their incomes for, any issues arising within models that negatively affect users' personal reputations may cause extensive user defection.\nAdditionally, the failure to properly integrate AI within search over the long term to provide proper competitive mitigation against other chatbots taking market share from Google needs to be properly understood. If Alphabet fails to restructure its offerings accordingly, I think it is quite possible it will lose a lot of users over the long term to OpenAI.\nDepending on how investors assess it, Alphabet's stock is either fairly valued or undervalued. However, when you factor in the likeliness of higher margins on the horizon from deeper internal implementations of AI and robotics, I think the investment is very likely undervalued at this time. The company's position in AI is formidable, and I believe it is highly unlikely that it will lose its position as one of the leaders in the field over the next few decades. There is lots of stability in the operational model, which includes stable free cash flow growth as a result of low capital expenditures, making the company more secure of an investment than some other big tech companies like Amazon, where the valuation is more largely dependent on investor sentiment to sustain it.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nThe Federal Reserve now expects just one rate cut in this year, and the market\u2019s reaction to this development has been calmer-than-expected, showing investors are now paying little to no attention to what the Fed does and instead have their eyes focused on AI, which continues to push the markets higher. Tech companies, small and large, are continuing to roll out AI-focused products and solutions, while funds are pouring billions into AI. \u00a0SoftBank has recently committed another $5 billion in AI investments for 5 companies ($1 billion each). A Wall Street Journal report cited SoftBank\u2019s CFO, who said the bank\u2019s chief Masayoshi Son was taking a \u201cbreak from quarterly earnings meetings so he could focus on AI.\u201d\nIn this backdrop it\u2019s important to stay ahead of the curve and see what\u2019s happening in the AI space.\nIn this article we will take a look at some of the biggest AI stock ratings updates and stories which can\u2019t be missed. We focused on AI stocks that are popular among the smart money investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nGongTo/Shutterstock.com\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nBank of America analyst Michael Hartnett last week pointed to the concentration of gains phenomenon on the market, saying if we remove the \u201cBig Ten\u201d stocks from the equation, the S&P 500\u2019s gain so far this year shrinks to just 3.6%. This \u201cBig Ten\u201d group also includes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG).\nAnother latest story around Alphabet Inc Class C\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0making waves is Bank of America\u2019s industry checks in the search engine market which found that Alphabet is still the market leader, with a whopping 95% share, with Bing\u2019s search coming in at just 0.7%.\nBofA\u2019s Justin Post said Alphabet Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0AI Overviews had a role to play here:\n\u201cAfter a consecutive eight months of decline, Google\u2019s US Search market share increased m/m in May, which could suggest AI Overviews are aiding query growth and usage,\u201d Post said.\nAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0bulls believe the market is not incorporating Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a02025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis.\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0April 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 \u2013 showing meaningful progress in the company\u2019s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company\u2019s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it\u2019s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. While we acknowledge the potential Alphabet, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL shares have rallied 26.7% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 10.3%. The company is benefiting from strong Google Services segment driven by search, YouTube, Pixel and particularly Android. Hence Google is making continuous efforts to bolster its Android features.This is evident from Alphabet\u2019s latest user interface (UI) redesign for one of its Android apps, Google Messages. The redesign presents a full-screen \"Select recipients\" UI with five recent conversations, a search button and a contact list. Users can select multiple conversations, select profile avatars and share individually by tapping the \"Next\" FAB.Alphabet further strengthened its Google Messages app with an upgrade that allows users to edit a Rich Communication Services message, enabling 15 minutes for typo correction. Users can edit the original message by long-pressing the pencil icon in the toolbar, and the original message can be viewed by long-pressing the overflow menu.These efforts will enable Google to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the global mobile messaging market, which, per a Future Market Insights report, is expected to reach $443.53 billion by 2033, indicating a CAGR of 15.9% between 2023 and 2033.\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\nAlphabet has been making concerted efforts to bolster other Android apps like Google Wallet, Google Maps and Google Photos, among others, in addition to Google Messages, in a bid to strengthen the Google Services segment.Google recently introduced a new Notifications feature for its Google Wallet app. The Wallet app now has six notification categories, namely Tips, Purchases, Passes, Transit, Updates & Alerts, and Promotional Campaigns, allowing users to receive transaction notifications from Google Wallet directly instead of Google Play services.Alphabet also announced a feature on Google Maps that shows entrances for buildings to some select users, addressing the issue of navigating to specific building portions on the map. This feature is aimed at improving the user experience and ensuring accurate directions for businesses or locations.Alphabet launched a free version of Magic Editor for Google Photos, allowing Android users to manipulate images, resize, and erase parts, apply background pre-sets and select with tap, circle, or brush.\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors to bolster its Android app offerings will, in turn, boost the Google Services segment.Strengthening the Google Services segment is expected to continue aiding Alphabet\u2019s overall financial performance in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $295.53 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.2%.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure has been revised upward by 0.5% in the past 30 days.\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Arista Networks ANET, Badger Meter BMI and Dropbox DBX, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 at present.

        "Title": "Alphabet\u2019s next CFO Anat Ashkenazi \u2018fills a void\u2019 for the company at key time during AI Revolution, says top analyst",
        "Author": "  Sheryl Estrada ",
        "Text": "Good morning. Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s finance chief Anat Ashkenazi was tapped as the next CFO and SVP of Google and Alphabet, and Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing partner, believes the tech giant has made a solid hire.\n\u201cThis was a strong candidate that fills a void for Alphabet at a key time in its growth transformation and \u2018AI Revolution,\u2019\u201d Ives told me. \u201cShe has a strong reputation and great CFO experience.\u201d\nAlphabet Inc., no. 8 on the 2024 Fortune 500 list, and the parent company of Google, announced on Wednesday that Ashkenazi will succeed Ruth Porat, effective July 31. A 23-year veteran of the Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical company Lilly, Ashkenazi began her CFO role in 2021. During her tenure, other roles included CFO of Lilly Research Laboratories, CFO for several of the company\u2019s global business areas, and leader of corporate strategy.\nPorat, CFO since 2015, and Alphabet's longest-serving finance chief, was promoted to a new role as president and chief investment officer of Alphabet and Google, previously announced in July 2023. Porat continued to occupy the CFO role as the company and board searched for her successor.\nAn 11-month search is on the \u201clonger side of the spectrum,\u201d Scott W. Simmons, co-managing partner of executive search firm Crist Kolder Associates, told me. However, the new CFO has \u201cbig shoes to fill, which immediately narrows the pool of viable candidates,\u201d he added.\nAshkenazi is leaving Lilly on a high note. The company ranks no. 127 on the Fortune 500, jumping up 15 spots from last year\u2019s ranking. Lilly earned $34 billion in revenue in 2023. She has been at the helm of finance as sales and demand for weight-loss drugs has skyrocketed. In Q1, worldwide revenue for Lilly rose 26% to $8.77 billion year over year, driven by the sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound.\nIn my conversation with Ashkenazi last winter about the competitive pricing of Zepbound, we also talked about her career journey at the company.\n\u201cWhen I joined Lilly, I started on the business development side in venture investing, which is very kind of financially driven,\u201d Ashkenazi explained. \u201cBut then I moved into strategy, and it opened my eyes to other areas, and I absolutely loved it. I love the breadth of looking at the entire business, the entire value chain from start to finish. I enjoyed being at the forefront of making really important decisions looking at very challenging and complex problems. And that\u2019s where my career shifted a little bit and got on the CFO track.\u201d\nShe added that during times of success and growth, or in challenging times, \u201cthe CFO should anchor the organization back to its core mission and values and chart the course forward.\u201d\nIn Ashkenazi, Alphabet has found \u201ca strong CFO, with a track record of strategic focus on long-term investment to fuel innovation and growth,\u201d Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement on Wednesday. Pichai also mentioned that he looks forward to working with Ashkenazi to invest responsibly in the company\u2019s next wave of growth in the AI era.\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s growth and evolution over the last 25 years has been an incredible story, helping billions of people and millions of businesses around the world,\u201d Ashkenazi said in a statement. The opportunity to have an impact is \"greater than ever,\" she said.\nSheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) we really liked what we saw.\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Alphabet, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.29 = US$97b \u00f7 (US$407b - US$77b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThus, Alphabet has an ROCE of 29%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 6.4% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Alphabet compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Alphabet .\nThe trends we've noticed at Alphabet are quite reassuring. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 29%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 57%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\nAll in all, it's terrific to see that Alphabet is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And a remarkable 228% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\nBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price. That's where you can check out our  FREE intrinsic value estimation for GOOGL   that compares the share price and estimated value.\nHigh returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\nHave feedback on this article?

Market analysts soon started pointing to the concentration of gains phenomena in the market, where just a few stocks accounted for most of the broader market gains. This tech concentration remains strong as of today, as all important AI and Cloud technologies that we see in the news are developed, acquired or marketed by mega-cap tech companies we\u2019re all familiar with. Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett recently said in a report that the S&P 500 has gained about 12% so far in the year, but if we remove 10 technology companies from the equation, these gains shrink to just 3.6%. Hartnett calls these companies the \u201cAI Big Ten\u201d group.\nWhat about the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that kept making headlines in 2023 and early 2024? Hartnett calculated that the broader market gained just 4.9% so far this year if these seven stocks are taken out of the equation. There is a third group of stocks that most investors are unaware of: Hedge Fund Top 30. These 30 stocks include the Magnificent Seven as well as 23 other promising stocks. These 30 stocks returned 53.2% in 2023, 20.2% during the first 5 months of 2024 vs. 11% for the S&P\u2019s large cap index.

The firm expects a combined $516 billion revenue opportunity from the enabling layer by 2027.\nNext up is the intelligence layer, which acts as the brain of the entire AI ecosystem. Large language models and backed software systems sit at this layer. UBS estimates that this layer presents a $225 billion opportunity by 2027.\nThe third layer in the AI market highlighted by UBS is the application layer. This is where the end user comes in. Cloud, data centers, GPUs, LLMs and algorithms amount to nothing if the end user cannot benefit from their huge processing power. UBS said estimating monetization opportunity of this layer was the hardest since it\u2019s still in its very early stage. The application layer addresses actual AI software used by customers \u2014 think AI assistants, GitHub CoPilot, marketing, customer service software, etc. UBS expects a whopping $395 billion in revenue opportunities for the application layer by 2027.\nKey AI Predictions\nThe UBS report also made key \u201cpredictions\u201d about the AI landscape. The firm\u2019s analysts believe the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) could give rise to a \u201ccapex cycle\u201d that could \u201cinflate\u201d the AI investment bubble. UBS sees the dominance of a few companies in the AI industry will continue to be a reality moving forward, as it expects \u201cmonolithic players\u201d and \u201cAI foundries\u201d prevailing in the near future.\nBased on this report, let\u2019s take a look at the top companies that will directly benefit from this $1.16 trillion opportunity by 2027. For this article we analyzed UBS analysis and picked 10 stocks that are directly exposed to the three layers in the AI ecosystem highlighted by UBS in its latest report. These companies are positioned extremely well to benefit from the monetization opportunities in the enabling, intelligence and application layers of the AI market. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nAccording to the latest UBS report, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls in all three layers of the AI value chain \u2013 enabling, intelligence and application layer. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an AI enabling player because of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform, while Gemini makes it a key player in the intelligence layer. On the application layer, UBS believes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has an edge with its Duet AI assistant and advertising. All these catalysts make Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) a company that could benefit from the $1.2 trillion AI opportunity by 2027, UBS said.\nAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0bulls believe the market is not incorporating Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a02025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis.\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0April 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 \u2013 showing meaningful progress in the company\u2019s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company\u2019s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it\u2019s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI \u201cValue Creation Opportunity\u201d.

        "Title": "How Nvidia Could Help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft Stocks Soar Even More",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's been a great time to own shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). All three stocks delivered strong gains last year and are up by double-digit percentages so far in 2024.\nBut it's been a spectacular time to own shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chip stock skyrocketed nearly 240% in 2023 and has vaulted more than 140% higher year to date.\nYou've probably heard the adage that \"success begets success.\" I think we'll see this proved in a convincing manner, with one company's success translating to success for others. Here's how Nvidia could help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft stocks soar even more.\nTo understand how Nvidia could help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, we first need to know something important about the three companies. Their cloud units are key growth drivers.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue jumped 28.4% year over year. This business generated nearly 20% of the company's total revenue growth despite making up less than 12% of total revenue.\nIt was a similar story for Amazon. Revenue for the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit increased 17% year over year in the first quarter, almost 39% of total revenue growth. AWS was an even bigger driver of Amazon's earnings growth.\nWhat about Microsoft? Its cloud business delivered revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter (which ended March 31) of 23% -- roughly 73% of total revenue growth.\nAnything that drives more customers to the cloud will directly help sales and earnings growth for Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. And over the long term, that should translate to increasing stock prices for each company.\nThis is where Nvidia comes into the picture. Its technology is helping all three giant cloud service providers to attract more customers and more business from existing customers.\nNvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress explained how the company is helping cloud service providers grow in its first-quarter earnings call. She said that organizations that use Nvidia's GPUs are able to train their large language models (LLMs) more quickly and more cost-effectively than with other chips. They can also deploy those models at the lowest cost with Nvidia's GPUs, Kress said.\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft enjoy exceptional returns on investment when they use Nvidia's AI technology. Kress said that cloud providers can earn $5 in hosting revenue with Nvidia's GPUs over four years for every $1 invested in the company's AI infrastructure.\nThese big cloud service providers also have ample motivation to adopt new technology introduced by Nvidia. In his company's first-quarter call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the importance of organizations being able to train AI models quickly.\nFor example, the company's forthcoming Blackwell GPU architecture enables training that is four times faster than with its wildly popular H100 GPUs. The new platform supports 30 times faster AI inference. It's not surprising that Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are among the early buyers of Blackwell -- even before it ships later this year.\nHaven't Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft developed their own AI chips? Could Nvidia's top customers become its rivals over time? Yes and yes.\nHuang was asked about this by an analyst in the first-quarter call. He responded by pointing out how Nvidia's technology differs from the custom chips the big cloud service providers offer. He believes that the scope, versatility, and low total cost of ownership of Nvidia's accelerated computing architecture; its pervasiveness across all types of computers, and the company's AI factories stand out as key competitive advantages.\nFor now, Nvidia and its big cloud customers enjoy a symbiotic relationship. Nvidia's sales grow as it launches new and improved AI technology. Alphabet's, Amazon's, and Microsoft's sales grow as they use Nvidia's latest products to attract customers. It's a win-win proposition for all four companies -- and their investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock's Recent Performance Being Led By Its Attractive Financial Prospects?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Most readers would already be aware that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock increased significantly by 24% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Alphabet's  ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n Check out our latest analysis for Alphabet \nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:\n28% = US$82b \u00f7 US$293b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.28 in profit.\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\nFirst thing first, we like that Alphabet has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 7.4% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for Alphabet's moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.\nAs a next step, we compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 6.0%.\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for GOOGL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. \nOverall, we are quite pleased with Alphabet's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "Title": "Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other hedge fund-approved stocks.\nInvesting, broadly speaking, narrows down to two strategies. These see an investor decide whether to buy a stock for the short term and make quick profits or hold it for years to patiently wait for the returns to accrue. One of the most successful investor of our times, Warren Buffett (see his latest portfolio), is an ardent follower of the latter approach, and his wealth bears testament to his success.\nOf course, deciding to pick the right stocks to sit on for years isn't easy or else everyone would be rich by now. However, there are ways in which one can gain an edge over others. One such way is to see what the professionals are doing and then emulate their strategy. At Insider Monkey, we get right at the heart of investing by picking out the top stocks that hedge funds are investing in. Why hedge fund stock picks? Well, these professionals, who almost often charge an arm and a leg for their services, conduct extensive due diligence to pick out the right set of stocks. After all, no one would invest with a hedge fund if the fund was simply picking stocks by flipping a coin.\nYet, while due diligence is great and necessary to protect investors, investing, at the end of the day, is all about returns. By the looks of it, the funds do seem to know what they're doing. Last year, the top ten hedge fund stock picks ended up outperforming the S&P benchmark stock index by 48.9 percentage points. In other words, while the index returned 26.1% in 2023, the top ten stocks returned 75.1% through price gains. This trend is also present in the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2023 as these posted 53.2% in gains to outperform the S&P by 27 percentage points. Unsurprisingly, year to May 29th, the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2024 led the S&P's 11% and posted 20.2% in gains.\nUnfortunately, though, data shows that as of 2021 end, 14% of the stock market was made of active funds while 16% was accounted for by passive funds. Compared to passive funds accounting for 8% of the market a decade ago with 20% belonging to active funds, it's clear that the broader public believes that shifting to passive is a safer investment approach. After all, while everyone wants to make money, no one wants to lose it either.\nBut what if one could make their own investing decisions and gain an inside track to investing by figuring out what stocks most hedge funds have invested in? Well, at Insider Monkey we regularly compile data from more than 900 hedge funds to see where the smart money is headed. This is how we know that the top hedge fund stocks outperformed the benchmark index last year, and it's also a strategy that's helped us beat the market over the last 10 years. Compared to the SPY's 235.6% in returns between 2014 and May 2024, the 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 463.7%.\nBut wait. At this point, you could argue that since hedge fund SEC filings come with a 45 day lag, perhaps they aren't that important. After all, it might be more important to know what the funds are doing now. Well, since we've been compiling top hedge fund stocks since 2012 in our quarterly newsletter, we can guarantee you that the top hedge fund stocks haven't changed by much since 2018. So not only isn't the time lag that significant, but by subscribing to our newsletter, you can gain an early track to see which stocks are falling out of favor among the funds as well.\nSo, all this talk about the top hedge fund stocks might make you wonder about the stocks themselves. Curious? Check out the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. We also cover legendary investors through pieces such as Warren Buffett\u2019s 12 Longest Held Stocks.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the top ten hedge fund stocks, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900+ hedge fund filings for Q1 2024 and picked out the stocks with the highest number of investors.\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 222\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a global household name due to its variety of products such as Google Search, YouTube, and Gmail. The bulk of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s fortunes are because of its dominance in the global search engine industry and lucrative deals with firms like Apple that make Search the default platform on thousands of devices. Additionally, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also a key player in the AI software industry, and its models compete with big ticket players such as the Microsoft backed OpenAI. Any threats to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s dominance in Search, any alternative products by customers, and a shift in global use cases to AI that's not developed by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) could be bad news for the firm.\nBaron Funds mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. The firm wasn't particularly worried about the technology giant losing its dominant status in the market. Here is what the firm said:\nDuring the quarter, we initiated a position in Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, the world\u2019s largest search and online advertising company. Alphabet has over 90% market share in its core Google search business, it owns the world\u2019s leading video platform, YouTube (which has over 2 billion users), a competitive cloud service provider, Google Cloud, a leading ad network, and optionality in a number of smaller subsidiaries like the autonomous vehicle company, Waymo.\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best hedge fund-approved stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now to see the other hedge fund-approved stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Bill Ackman's 2024 Portfolio: 6 Best Stocks to Buy in 2024. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0Bill Ackman\u00a0recently made headlines after reports suggested he plans to take his investment firm public as soon as next year. A Wall Street Journal report said the 58-year-old billionaire was selling a stake in Pershing Square to investors as part of a funding round that could value the firm at about $10.5 billion. According to data from WSJ, Pershing Square managed over $16 billion in assets as of the end of April. The publication said Ackman has told investors that he plans to at least quadruple assets under management.\nAckman has run a concentrated portfolio for years. As of the end of the March quarter this year, his portfolio was worth over $10 billion, with just seven stocks. And yet Ackman made $610 million last year, coming in at the seventh position in Bloomberg\u2019s annual list of the best-paid hedge fund founders.\nIn 2022, Ackman, who writes long and fiery posts on Twitter, announced that he was done with activist investing and was taking a \u201cquieter approach.\u201d In 2023, Pershing Square Holdings generated strong NAV performance of 26.7% versus 26.3% for its principal benchmark, the S&P 500 index.\nAckman talked in detail about the fund\u2019s returns and future strategy during his 2023\u00a0letter to investors:\n\u201cWhile our investments in hedging and asymmetric instruments have been enormously profitable, we could have done better. In each of the three black swan events of the last 20 years, we had an early and highly variant view of the likely impact and probability of their occurrence and had identified and invested in instruments that offered profits many times their cost. In retrospect, we should have invested more and achieved even greater profits without risking materially more capital.\u201d\nFor this article we scanned Ackman\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked his top six stock holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nBillionaire Bill Ackman\u2019s\u00a0Q1\u20192024 Stake Value:\u00a0$1,427,771,711\nBillionaire Ackman owns a $1.4 billion stake in Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). In his 2023 letter to investors, Ackman addressed the concerns around Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) amid the rise of AI language models:\nThe cumulative impact of AI and machine learning enhancements is perhaps most evident in Google\u2019s core Search franchise. Google Search has evolved from its starting point as a simple results page with \u201c10 blue links\u201d and now provides summary answer snippets for informational and educational queries similar to AI chatbots without any of their latency. For more involved queries, for example, in travel, the company has developed specialized Google Flights and Hotels modules that offer consumers substantial utility and freedom to direct their discovery process. Innovation in Google Search has maintained its leading market position through multiple perceived \u201cdisruption\u201d risks over time, including the platform transition from desktop-tomobile and competitive threats from social media and verticalized search. Likewise, we view the company\u2019s integration of generative AI into a wider range of queries, not as a disruptive shift, but as a natural evolution of its Search product which will enhance the user experience and improve conversion for advertisers. We continue to believe Google is one of the most advantaged and scaled players in AI with an unmatched business model. The company\u2019s stock currently trades at approximately 19 times forward earnings, a deep discount to its peers despite its similar rate of projected earnings growth\nRead\u00a0Ackman\u2019s letter here.\nAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0bulls believe the company is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrate with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0app is to urge users to sign up for \u2018Google One AI Premium\u2019 plan, which has a $19.99 price tag. \u00a0Google saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc.

And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this internet search leader is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 23.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 31.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 28.1%.\nCash Flow Growth\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Alphabet is 16.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -15.4%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.5%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Alphabet. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.4% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Alphabet a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Alphabet is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 21, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Micron Technology, Inc. MU, Vistra Corp. VST and CenterPoint Energy, Inc. CNP.\nHere are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nConsumer price pressures eased in May, thanks to a drop in gasoline prices that more than offset a dogged rise in shelter prices. The Labor Department stated that the consumer price index (CPI) held flat last month as inflationary pressure loosened its grip on the U.S. economy.\nFrom a year ago, the CPI nevertheless increased 3.3%. But it's still less than April's yearly rise of 3.4% and way less than the pandemic-era peak of 9.1% in 2022, the highest level since 1981.\nCore CPI, which doesn't consider the volatile fuel and food costs, also saw its monthly and yearly increase falling short of estimates. Core CPI's annual rate declined to 3.4%, a fresh three-year low, as transportation service prices dropped for the first time in May since 2021, and vehicle insurance prices fell following a sharp rise in the prior two months.\nProducer prices, meanwhile, dropped surprisingly last month, a tell-tale sign that inflation is subsiding. The producer price index fell 0.2% month over month in May, following an advance of 0.5% in April.\nThis is a tell-tale sign that the Federal Reserve will remain less aggressive with its monetary policy and won't be hiking interest rates this year. In reality, the Fed has kept interest rates unchanged in its latest policy meeting and is projecting one rate cut this year, preferably in September. The CME FedWatch Tool at present shows that 57.9% of market participants expect a quarter-point interest rate cut in the September meeting.\nNow, interest rate hikes are intended to curb consumer outlays and control inflation. But the latest dip in retail sales in May has shown that consumers are already feeling the burden of higher interest rates. Thus, it's widely expected that the Fed will trim interest rates as early as the fall, which is undeniably a blessing in disguise for tech stocks. This is because a tech company's cash inflows aren't impacted in a low-interest-rate environment. Moreover, interest rate cuts reduce the cost of borrowing and boost profit margins.\nSimilarly, a lower interest rate scenario bodes well for capital-intensive utility companies as it decreases their debt level and helps them pay off their dues and notch profits. This calls for investing in stocks such as Alphabet Inc., NVIDIA Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Vistra Corp. and CenterPoint Energy, Inc. at the moment. The stocks boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nAlphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. GOOGL currently has a Zacks Rank #1.

NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 12.1% over the past 60 days.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: Amazon vs. Alphabet",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has captivated the tech world over the last year, with many companies pivoting their businesses toward the budding sector. According to Grand View Research, the AI market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it hit a valuation nearing $2 trillion.\nThe generative technology can potentially boost a range of industries, from cloud computing to autonomous vehicles, e-commerce, productivity software, and much more. AI's growth potential suggests it's not too late to invest long-term in the industry and benefit from its future development.\nAs leading cloud companies, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) are two attractive options. These tech giants are investing heavily in AI and could have much to offer investors in the coming years. So, let's take a closer look at both and determine which is the better option today.\nIt's hard not to be bullish about Amazon after the last year. The company's business was hit hard by an economic downturn in 2022 that dragged its stock down 50% alongside significant profit losses. However, Amazon has since pulled off an impressive turnaround that has showcased its reliability over the long term.\nShares in Amazon have climbed 46% in the last 12 months. The retail giant has rallied investors with solid growth in its e-commerce segments and an expanding role in AI. In its most recent period (the first quarter of 2024), Amazon's revenue increased by 13% year over year. The company delivered a 12% rise in sales in its North American division and a 10% increase in its international segment.\nHowever, the largest increase came from its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It posted revenue gains of 17% year over year, with operating income soaring 84%.\nAWS is easily Amazon's biggest growth driver and grants the company a powerful position in AI. Over the last year, AWS has gradually expanded its AI cloud services and announced a venture into chip design. Meanwhile, recent growth indicates the company's heavy investment in AI is beginning to pay off.\nIn addition to cloud computing, Amazon is improving its e-commerce business with AI. The tech giant has introduced a new AI-powered shopping assistant called Rufus, alongside improvements to shipping logistics, tracking shopping trends, and product recommendations.\nAlphabet's AI efforts have lagged slightly behind rivals like Amazon and Microsoft, with the third-largest cloud market share behind both companies. However, Alphabet remains a compelling way to invest in AI, thanks to its diverse product range and massive user base.\nThe tech giant may be best known for its search engine, Google, but Alphabet is so much more. In fact, the company's primary business is digital advertising, which makes up more than 80% of its revenue. In-house brands like Android, YouTube, Chrome, and the many products under Google attract billions of users and offer almost endless advertising opportunities.\nMeanwhile, these brands could similarly help attract users to Alphabet's AI products. \u00a0Alphabet is sinking billions into AI, unveiling its most advanced AI model, Gemini, earlier this year. And on May 30, the company announced a $2 billion plan to build a new data center in Malaysia, equipped with a Google Cloud hub.\nIt will take time for Alphabet to realize its full potential in AI, but its range of potent brands indicates a solid outlook in the industry. Improved technology could allow the company to monetize its AI efforts by making Google's experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT, adding generative features to Android, expanding Google Cloud's AI tools, improving video recommendations on YouTube, and offering more efficient advertising.\nAlphabet is on a promising growth path in AI that might be too good to pass up.\nAlphabet and Amazon are behemoths in tech, evident by their positions as the world's fourth- and fifth-most-valuable companies by market capitalization. Their products are used by people and businesses worldwide, suggesting vast potential in AI.\nSince 2019, Alphabet and Amazon have delivered stock growth of 176% and 184%, respectively, illustrating their reliability as long-term holds. With such comparable businesses, the best way to determine the better stock could lie in their valuations.\nThis chart shows that Alphabet has a significantly lower forward price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash flow than Amazon, suggesting the Google company is trading at a far better value.\nIn addition to a range of potent brands and a vast user base, Alphabet is worth investing in over Amazon right now. However, it's still a good idea to keep Amazon on your radar and potentially buy when its shares are trading at a more attractive price point.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $740,690!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "Lakehouse Capital, a Sydney-based investment manager, released its \u201cLakehouse Global Growth Fund\u201d April 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. April was a busy month as many of the companies in the portfolio reported earnings. The Fund returned -4.3% net of fees and expenses for the month compared to -2.8% for its benchmark. Since its inception in December 2017, the Fund has returned 152.8% compared to 96.0% for its benchmark, the MSCI All Country World Index, Net Total Returns (AUD). As of the end of April, the Fund's largest sector allocations were to consumer discretionary (19.3%), information technology (22.6%), and communication services (27.0%). In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund highlighted stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, offers various platforms and services operating through Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. The one-month return of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was 0.83%, and its shares gained 36.36% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On June 3, 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock closed at $174.42 per share with a market capitalization of $2.147 trillion.\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\n\"Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts' expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 \u2013 showing meaningful progress in the company\u2019s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company\u2019s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it's not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.\"\nPhoto by Firmbee.com on Unsplash\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in 7th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 165 hedge fund portfolios held Alphabet Inc.

Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) trailing 12-month revenue is $318.15 billion and its year over year quarterly growth rate is 15.40%. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

According to Commerzbank, the company creates a basis for long-term \"real-time experiences\" by integrating AI into its wide range of products, including Google Search, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Android smartphones.\nCommerzbank analysts particularly highlight the impressive development in the advertising business. \"The advertising business, especially with the internet search engine and YouTube ad revenue, continues to grow dynamically and has additional revenue potential,\" the note states. Additionally, the regular dividend payment and the ongoing extensive share buyback program are evaluated positively.\nThe latest business figures underscore Alphabet's strong position: revenue increased from $267 billion in 2022 to $284 billion in 2023, while net profit rose from $57 billion to $68 billion.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG.L) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nAs you can see below, Alphabet had US$11.9b of debt, at March 2024, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$108.1b in cash, so it actually has US$96.2b net cash.\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Alphabet had liabilities of US$77.0b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$37.5b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$108.1b as well as receivables valued at US$44.6b due within 12 months. So it actually has US$38.1b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nHaving regard to Alphabet's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$2.14t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Simply put, the fact that Alphabet has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.\nOn top of that, Alphabet grew its EBIT by 34% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Alphabet's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Alphabet may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years, Alphabet recorded free cash flow worth 80% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Alphabet has US$96.2b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And we liked the look of last year's 34% year-on-year EBIT growth. So we don't think Alphabet's use of debt is risky. Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all. If you've also come to that realization, you're in luck, because today you can view this interactive graph of Alphabet's earnings per share history for free.\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Alphabet fair value estimate is US$200\nAlphabet's US$176 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate\nOur fair value estimate is 3.1% higher than Alphabet's analyst price target of US$194\nHow far off is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n View our latest analysis for Alphabet \nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$80.4b\nUS$92.2b\nUS$108.8b\nUS$122.5b\nUS$129.5b\nUS$135.0b\nUS$140.1b\nUS$144.7b\nUS$149.1b\nUS$153.4b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x17\nAnalyst x18\nAnalyst x11\nAnalyst x4\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 4.30%\nEst @ 3.72%\nEst @ 3.32%\nEst @ 3.04%\nEst @ 2.84%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% \nUS$75.0k\nUS$80.2k\nUS$88.4k\nUS$92.8k\nUS$91.5k\nUS$89.0k\nUS$86.2k\nUS$83.1k\nUS$79.8k\nUS$76.6k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$843b\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$153b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.2%\u2013 2.4%) = US$3.3t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.3t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$1.6t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.5t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$176, the company appears about fair value at a 12% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alphabet as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.045. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL is steadily moving toward attaining its zero-carbon goals.Reportedly, its division Google partnered with NV Energy, a utility company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, to power its data centers located in Nevada with geothermal electricity.Google strives to boost the amount of carbon-free geothermal electricity from 3.5 megawatts to 115 megawatts into the local power grid for its operations over the next six years.NV Energy entered a purchase agreement with advanced geothermal developer Fervo Energy in order to execute the underlined deal.Google-NV Energy partnership is subject to state utility regulators\u2019 approval.\n\u00a0\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\nGoogle, which has been carbon-neutral since 2007, is leaving no stone unturned to achieve net-zero emissions across all of its operations and value chain by 2030.The company aims to reduce 50% of its combined Scope 1, 2, and 3 absolute emissions before 2030.GOOGL plans to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize its remaining emissions.In this regard, the company\u2019s huge investments in wind and solar energies remain noteworthy. Google's global operations are powered by 64% carbon-free energy, including wind and solar.Its transition to geothermal energy remains a major positive as the energy uses naturally occurring underground heat to produce renewable electricity, unlike solar and wind energies, which depend on the availability of sunshine and wind.Google\u2019s shift from fossil fuels to clean energy is anticipated to reduce costs in the near and long terms, which is a plus.\nThe carbon-free drive is gaining strong traction across the technology sector.Not only Alphabet but companies like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Lam Research LRCX are also taking initiatives to lower overall carbon footprints and cut energy bills substantially.Amazon is known as the biggest corporate investor in renewable energy. Its growing investments in the projects have accelerated the pace of its journey toward powering its infrastructure with 100% renewable energy. The goal was initially targeted to be met by 2030, which is now expected to be achieved by 2025. In 2021, the company reached 85% renewable energy across its business.Microsoft is gathering steam to become carbon-negative by 2030. Further, MSFT aims to remove all green gas emissions by 2050.Lam Research is committed to reaching its goal of carbon net-zero emissions by 2050 and operating business on 100% renewable energy by 2030.\nIn this era, environmental, social and governance factors have become crucial for building a sustainable business. Now, investors worldwide not only look at how much a company is capable of generating high profits but also consider how much its business is sustainable for the future.Given this scenario, Alphabet, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), remains well-poised to gain investor optimism on the back of its growing efforts to reduce its carbon footprint.

        "Title": "Alphabet: The Discreet AI Leader",
        "Author": "  Akim Guerreiro ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) access to data is unrivalled and the artificial intelligence revolution has higher probability to transit at some point through the company. Google has a 90% market share in search activity, and there lies its competitive advantage (or moat) in the AI race. The stock's valuation is still within the historical valuation range it has been subject to since 2010, despite being on the verge of a potential earnings breakout. Analysts expect double-digit growth in the next couple of years, and a breakout from the valuation range is also expected if growth accelerates.\nHowever, the real catalyst for Alphabet's stock is the continued growth of its AI capabilities. The first looks we have gotten on the Gemini AI model are promising and the valuation of the stock is not yet taking into account the AI wave. Alphabet has advanced access to global data and its integration of AI in users' search activity drive up the returns of ad-paying companies. The company, therefore, is one of the most attractive AI plays to own in a tech-oriented portfolio.\nAll AI models, from Microsoft Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MSFT) OpenAI to Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips and Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) robotaxis, have one single point of departure: data collection. The way the data is interpreted (the output) varies of course from model to model, but the input differs significantly. Nvidia's chips are currently leading in the hardware of the data inputs and outputs; however, Alphabet's dominant access to data inputs and their funnelling to Google DeepMind should lead - under proper management- to the company leading the AI revolution.\nGoogle's 90% market share in search activity (or data collection) puts Gemini in a first-mover advantage position in a segment where users typically stick with their favored search tools. Given the market share, Google is a natural destination of a large portion of online advertising revenues. Although the nominal amount of advertising revenues has been increasing, its decline in the revenue share of Google is noticeable.\nThe decline is not worrisome per se, as it is largely compensated by a high growth cloud segment. The spreading of the revenue sources indicates a healthier growth path for the company and lower dependence on one single revenue source. Where AI comes into play is the Gemini model developed by Google's DeepMind drastically improves the search experience of prospective customers. With improved functions, Google would lead consumer to the specific result, page, website or business that he or she is looking for. This brings to ad-paying companies the benefit of a higher conversion rate of prospective customers into actual customers. Essentially, the companies paying for ads on Google will be paying for its ability to target warmer leads, hence largely improving the return on advertising investments. In turn, the growing demand and spending for Google's AI-targeted advertising would lead to an increase of advertising revenue.\nA promising improvement in the search experience of Google users is the chatbots. According to a Wall Street Journal article, 36% of Google's Gemini users use the chatbot for shopping, compared to 23% of ChatGPT users. This shows Google already has a lead in the shopping experience of users. To predict which company will lead and win the AI race, the question that needs to be asked is which company has more access to data. Google seems to have the lead.\nWe will now look at the hard figures to determine whether or not the stock is currently attractively priced despite the recent rise.\nShares of Alphabet have been outperforming the broader market. The stock gained over 25% in the first five months of the year first-quarter earnings smashed Wall Street's expectations ($1.89 per share versus $1.50 expected).\nAlphabet even announced its first ever dividend payment. If we compare this performance with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has had a significantly lower earnings growth rate in the last five years and is expected to remain low over the next five years, Alphabet's stock still has room to grow. Apple trades at a forward price-earnings ratio of 28, while Alphabet trades at 22 times. This comes despite the impressive growth rates in revenue, earnings per share, Ebitda and free cash flow over the past decade.\nSource: GuruFocus\nThe enterprise value-to-Ebitda multiple is also on a rising trend, but has not broken out of the median range.\n GOOGL Data by GuruFocus\nThe stock is trading at a reasonable 19 times last 12 months Ebitda (14 times forward Ebitda), in line with the last 10 years - before the emergence of AI. Although there has been a catch-up in price since the start of the year to reflect higher earnings and the start of a dividend payment, it appears that no AI premium is yet allocated to the valuation of the stock. Therefore, it may be undervalued in light of its AI leadership.\nLast but not least, the expected growth rates ranging from 11.20% to 30.80% (depending on which metric is observed), though conservative (in line with past growth rates and hence not reflecting AI as a growth catalyst), make the stock likely to outperform the broader market and the S&P 500 Index over the next three years.\nThe stock appears, therefore, attractively valued, in line with the historical range, and is expected to rise, on average, by double digits every year over the next three years. The risk-reward ratio for the stock is appealing to investors that want to ride the AI wave and that have potentially missed some of the stock price spikes across the market.\nThe main risk factor is the catch-up from competition, particularly Microsoft's OpenAI model. If Microsoft improves the search experience provided to users, this could divert a portion of the revenue from Google. It is unlikely for competitors to beat the company in the browsing experience, where the latter has a long-held advantage. The main danger here lies in competitors using chatbots to divert user activity from the Google browser. However, it is not obvious at the moment that competitors have been able to do so. The fact that, as previously mentioned, 36% of Google's Gemini users use the chatbot for shopping, compared to 23% of ChatGPT users, may indicate Google offers a better chatbot experience and may have a competitive advantage there as well. Only time will tell, so the main risk for Alphabet is the competition introducing a better offering in the advertising space that would attract both users and ad-paying companies away from Google and Gemini.\nAlphabet's valuation is still within the historical valuation range it has been subject to since 2010, or within the 15 to 20 times Ebitda median. This is despite being on the verge of a potential earnings breakout with its AI advancements. Alphabet's leading position in data collection gives its DeepMind Gemini AI model an advantage over the competition.\nGiven the high growth rates in the past decade and the likely continued double-digit growth in the next three years, Alphabet is in a good position to continue outperforming the broader market. And even more so if its AI capability continues to materialize in its earnings, in turn increasing dividend payments and share buybacks.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. named Eli Lilly & Co. executive Anat Ashkenazi as its new chief financial officer, replacing Ruth Porat who announced last year she planned to step down.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nReal Estate Investors Are Wiped Out in Bets Fueled by Wall Street Loans\nBehind \u2018Suicide Squad,\u2019 the Year\u2019s Biggest Video-Game Flop\nHere\u2019s Everything Apple Plans to Show at Its AI-Focused WWDC Event\nPutin\u2019s Wartime Central Banker Tells Him What He Doesn\u2019t Want to Hear\nVietnam Tycoon Sentenced to Death Faces New Charges: Media\nAshkenazi, 51, has served as CFO and executive vice president at the drug maker, where she worked for more than 23 years, Alphabet said in a filing Wednesday morning. Her new position is effective July 31.\nPorat, 66, who took over as CFO for Google in 2015, oversaw the search giant\u2019s transition into the current structure under Alphabet and has taken on a new role at the company as president and chief investment officer. As the company\u2019s longest-serving CFO, she famously ushered in a period of greater fiscal discipline at Alphabet, oversaw growth of the cloud computing unit, which became profitable last year, and YouTube, now the most popular streaming service on television.\nFor the past year, Porat has overseen Alphabet\u2019s investments in its Other Bets division, an eclectic collection of nascent businesses such as life sciences unit Verily and autonomous driving startup Waymo that the company is working to nudge toward profitability.\nAshkenazi, who served as Eli Lilly\u2019s CFO since 2021, oversaw the finance chiefs of the commercial business as well as those for research and development and manufacturing and quality, and also led the corporate strategic planning team and business transformation office. During Ashkenazi\u2019s time as CFO, Lilly launched Mounjaro and Zepbound, drugs for diabetes and weight-loss that have made it the most valuable pharmaceutical company in the world.\nHer move to Alphabet is \u201cvery tough to question despite the monster of a pharma (and consumer) play Lilly has become,\u201d said Jared Holz, an analyst at Mizuho Group. The Alphabet CFO \u201cgig is probably one of the best in corporate America.\u201d\nAlphabet shares gained 1.3% Wednesday morning in New York.\nAshkenazi steps into the role at a pivotal moment for Alphabet. The company, valued at more than $2 trillion, has reoriented its teams and focus around generative artificial intelligence, which can answer questions in a conversational tone based on people\u2019s prompts. The company has already served billions of queries with its generative AI features. But the computing power and costs associated with the technology is enormous. Ashkenazi will need to manage Alphabet\u2019s books as the company continues to invest heavily in data centers and compete with other tech giants for talented employees.\nShe will be based in the San Francisco Bay Area, reporting to Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to have found such a strong CFO, with a track record of strategic focus on long-term investment to fuel innovation and growth,\u201d Pichai said in a statement. \u201cThe AI era is giving us an incredible opportunity to innovate at scale across our core products, and to create entirely new products and experiences for our users and customers. I look forward to working with Anat as we invest responsibly to support our next wave of growth.\u201d\nHealth Care Advantage\nAshkenazi\u2019s background in health care may also play a part in boosting Alphabet\u2019s reputation in a sector with vast potential in generative AI, said Mandeep Singh, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. She \u201ccould help expand Alphabet\u2019s addressable market and help catalyze some of its moonshots,\u201d Singh said, \u201cgiven her background and the availability of data in health care as a generative AI application.\u201d\nAlphabet has been trying to revolutionize health care for years, with varied success. Recently, the company announced a slew of initiatives to deploy its AI models in the health care industry, including a tool that will help Fitbit users glean insights from their wearable devices. Last year, Google unveiled Med-PaLM, an AI model that has capably fielded medical questions. The announcements followed a broad shift in strategy for the company in 2021, in which it moved to embed health-care research and other functionality in its core products like search and YouTube, rather than starting new commercial services.\nBut the efforts have left some of its moonshot goals in health care, embodied by Alphabet units like Verily and the life-extension company Calico, to somewhat languish. Ashkenazi may play a vital role in re-prioritizing efforts that once made eye-catching headlines.\nAlphabet\u2019s shares are up about 40% over the past year and the company reported quarterly profit that increased by more than half in the first quarter. YouTube and the cloud business are expected to end 2024 at a combined annual run rate of more than $100 billion, Alphabet has said. The company also announced its first cash dividend in April, a welcome sign to investors after months of heavy spending on AI.\n(Updates with Alphabet CEO comments in 10th paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nSam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI\nLegacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

It is benefiting from the robust performance of the Google Services segment, which is mainly driven by Search, YouTube, Android, Pixel, and its first-party web apps.YouTube is playing a vital role in driving Google Services prospects. The company is continuously expanding YouTube capabilities thereby enhancing user experiencePer a 9to5Google report, Alphabet introduced a redesign for YouTube Music on the web. This redesign features a dual-column layout with album information displayed on the left and songs displayed on the right. It also adds a blurred background for a lively experience.Google also bolstered its YouTube Music capabilities with the addition of a new feature that remembers the last played song and allows quick playback. This quality-of-life change retains the docked player and Up Next queue for albums and playlists, allowing immediate playback.Partnerships are playing a key role in expanding YouTube Music\u2019s adoption rate. Alphabet recently collaborated with Garmin GRMN to expand its reach to more platforms.The YouTube Music app is now available on Garmin IQ Connect smartwatches. The app experience is similar to Wear OS watches, with users able to search their library for music and podcasts and a slick playing page with physical buttons for play, pause, and skip.Growing YouTube Music efforts are helping Alphabet capitalize on solid growth opportunities present in the music streaming market, which, per a Grand View Research report, is expected to witness a CAGR of 14.4% between 2023 and 2030.Moreover, these would also aid Alphabet in narrowing down the gap with Spotify SPOT, which holds a dominant position in the music streaming market.Per a Statista report, Spotify retains its position as the leading player in 2023, with its market share based on subscribers being approximately 32%.\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\nIn addition to YouTube Music, Alphabet is taking continuous strides to boost its overall YouTube capabilities.This is evident from the company\u2019s latest Cast menu redesign of the YouTube app. The updated Cast icon now features a floating bottom sheet with rounded corners, allowing users to control volume and voice search, and also provides remote control options for televisions.Alphabet also expanded its YouTube Create video editing app for Android to 13 more countries, including Australia, Brazil, Spain, and the United States. The app simplifies short-form video creation for creators from various regions, eliminating the need for high-end computers and file transfers.Google partnered with Peloton Interactive PTON to further strengthen its YouTube business. This partnership marks a significant step for Google to expand its YouTube TV subscriber base, as it requires Peloton All-Access members to have a YouTube TV subscription to watch content while on their machine.These endeavors will continue expanding YouTube\u2019s overall subscribers.

Shares of the company have rallied 24.4% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Internet Services industry\u2019s growth of 19.3%.In order to deliver generative AI experience across its products and services, Google is constantly making efforts to power them with its most advanced and powerful large language model (\u201cLLM\u201d), namely Gemini.Reportedly, the company is planning to add a Spotify extension to Gemini in order to deliver an enhanced music streaming experience to Gemini users.This comes right after the recent rollout of YouTube Music Gemini Extension, which enables users to search music and play radio, among others, with the help of an AI chatbot experience.These endeavors are expected to aid Alphabet in gaining momentum in the music streaming space.\n\u00a0\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc.

Quote\nPer a Precedence Research report, the global autonomous vehicle market is expected to reach $2.35 trillion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 35% between 2023 and 2032.Alphabet is well-poised to penetrate the booming autonomous driving space rapidly on the back of its strong efforts toward reaching out to more customers on the back of its robust driverless technology and expansion efforts.The company\u2019s multi-year partnership with Uber Technologies UBER to offer an autonomous driving experience to the latter\u2019s customers in Phoenix, AZ, is a positive. This deal is in sync with the company\u2019s deepening focus in Phoenix.GOOGL\u2019s expansion of the operating area of Waymo One in Phoenix, which now includes rides to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, is a plus.Waymo\u2019s effort to expand its operations to downtown Phoenix is noteworthy. It also rolled out a rider-only service in downtown Phoenix.Apart from Phoenix, Waymo received regulatory approval to expand in Los Angeles.The company is testing self-driving vehicles on the streets of Austin, TX, which was declared the fourth city for Waymo One last year. Waymo\u2019s electric Jaguar I-PACE vehicles, which are equipped with advanced Waymo Driver technology, are being tested across 43 square miles in Austin, which includes the heart of downtown, Barton Hills, Riverside, East Austin and Hyde Park.Waymo is also testing its self-driving vehicles on the streets of Bellevue, WA.\nGrowing Waymo\u2019s efforts are boosting Alphabet\u2019s competitive position against its peers like Amazon AMZN and Baidu BIDU, which are making every effort to capitalize on the growth prospects in the autonomous driving space.\nAlphabet\u2019s shares have also outperformed that of Amazon and Baidu on a year-to-date basis. GOOGL has gained 31.9% compared with AMZN\u2019s return of 22.7%. BIDU has lost 25.6% in the same time frame.Amazon\u2019s buyout of Zoox, a developer of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, remains a major positive. The company\u2019s launch of its first self-driving robotaxi strengthened its position in the autonomous driving space.Zoox has been testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Foster City. It intends to open an engineering office and operations facility, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing.It also plans to establish a large-scale manufacturing facility for its autonomous vehicles. The facility will be located at Hayward Exchange @ 92, 25810 Clawiter Rd, which will expand Zoox\u2019s presence in the East Bay.Meanwhile, Baidu is gaining from the strong momentum of the Apollo Go Robotaxi service across China on the back of its increasing availability in several cities and a growing number of rides.Apollo Go is available in 10 cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Changsha, Cangzhou, Yangquan, Wuzhen Water Town and Wuhan.\nAlphabet\u2019s growing autonomous driving initiatives, coupled with its dominant position in the search engine market, strong cloud momentum and robust generative AI capabilities, are expected to drive top-line growth in the days ahead.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $291.3 billion, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 13.6%. \u00a0However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company continues to face significant litigation across various regions.

        "Text": "Google parent Alphabet has poached Anat Ashkenazi from pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly to serve\u00a0as its next chief financial officer, the company announced Wednesday.\nAshkenazi, 51, will take over the key role effective July 31 and replace Alphabet\u2019s longtime CFO Ruth Porat.\nThe Big Tech giant had announced nearly one year ago that Porat, 66, would be transitioning to a new role as the company\u2019s president and chief investment officer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very pleased to have found such a strong CFO, with a track record of strategic focus on long-term investment to fuel innovation and growth,\u201d Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement.\nAshkenazi joined Eli Lilly in 2001, where she \u201chad a diverse career spanning financial, strategy and operations roles\u201d over 23 years, Google said in an SEC filing.\nEli Lilly confirmed her departure and said it was conducting an internal and external search to replace her.\nMeanwhile, Porat will remain as Google CFO through the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings in July.\nGoogle shares were up less than 1% in premarket trading.\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s growth and evolution over the last 25 years has been an incredible story, helping billions of people and millions of businesses around the world,\u201d Ashkenazi said in a statement.\n\u201cToday, the opportunity for impact is greater than ever, and I feel honored to be joining Sundar and his leadership team as they invest for the company\u2019s future at such an exciting moment.\u201d\nAshkenazi takes over the C-suite role at a critical time for Google, which is navigating a messy rollout of its AI-powered search engine as it scrambles to keep pace with rivals such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI.\nGoogle said it was \u201ctaking swift action\u201d to fix bizarre behavior from its AI Overviews feature, which advised users to eat rocks and add glue to their pizza.\nThe tech giant is in the midst of an ongoing workforce shakeup this year that has included small rounds of layoffs, including cuts to at least 100 staffers in its cloud unit earlier this week. Google has looked to slash costs while diverting more resources toward AI.\nThe company also faces a series of legal headaches, including landmark Justice Department antitrust cases targeting its online search business and its digital advertising segment.\nA federal judge is expected to rule on whether Google has a monopoly over online search later this year.\nElsewhere, Google confirmed that its chief privacy officer, Keith Enright, will be leaving the company this fall.\n"

        "Title": "Eli Lilly (LLY) Veteran Anat Ashkenazi to Join Alphabet as CFO",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Eli Lilly and Company LLY announced that its executive vice president and chief financial officer\u00a0(CFO) Anat Ashkenazi has resigned after serving for 23 years at the company. Ashkenazi has joined Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet\u00a0GOOGL as CFO and senior vice president, effective Jul 31, 2024. Until then, she will continue to serve in her present role at Lilly.\nUntil Ashkenazi joins in her new role as CFO of Google and Alphabet, Ruth Porat, the present CFO of Alphabet will continue as CFO. In July last year, Alphabet announced that Ruth Porat would move into a new role as president & chief investment officer of Alphabet and Google, effective from September 2023, but remain CFO until a successor was hired. Anat will be based in the San Francisco Bay Area and will report directly to Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.\nAshkenazi has been Lilly\u2019s CFO since 2021. Before she assumed the position of CFO, Ashkenazi served as senior vice president, controller, and chief financial officer of\u00a0Lilly Research Laboratories, as well as CFO for Lilly\u2019s several global business areas. Lilly has begun its search for a new CFO, both internally and externally.\nLilly\u2019s stock has risen 42.7% year to date compared with an increase of 18.5% for the industry.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn the last three years of her tenure as CFO, Lilly experienced tremendous growth. Its stock rose 273.8% in the last three years. Lilly\u2019s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance Taltz and others. Lilly\u2019s new tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and weight loss medicine, Zepbound, have become key top-line drivers for Lilly despite a short time on the market. Mounjaro was launched in mid-2022. Zepbound was launched in November 2023.\nTirzepatide is a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist (GIP/GLP-1 RA). The GLP-1 segment is an important class of drugs for multiple cardiometabolic diseases and is gaining significant popularity with the demand for weight loss drugs rising rapidly. Lilly launched Mounjaro and Zepbound during Ashkenazi's time as CFO.\nIt is believed that Ashkenazi\u2019s deep experience at Lilly will be good for Google and Alphabet, which is investing heavily in generative artificial intelligence, growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market and cutting costs through layoffs. However, investors are surprised about Ashkenazi\u2019s transition from the healthcare sector to the tech industry. Nonetheless, her experience in healthcare can help a tech giant like Alphabet push into the healthcare industry.\nLilly currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nEli Lilly and Company price-consensus-chart | Eli Lilly and Company Quote\n\u00a0\nSome better-ranked stocks in the healthcare sector are Acrivon Therapeutics ACRV and Heron Therapeutics HRTX, with a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy) each. You can see\u00a0the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nIn the past 60 days, loss estimates for Acrivon Therapeutics have narrowed from $3.51 per share to $2.47 per share for 2024. For 2025, loss estimates have narrowed from $3.41 per share to $2.55 per share over the same timeframe.\nACRV beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the mark once, delivering an average earnings surprise of 3.56%. Year to date, shares of ACRV have risen 50.2%.\nIn the past 60 days, loss estimates for Heron Therapeutics have narrowed from 22 cents per share to 10 cents per share for 2024. For 2025, estimates have improved from a loss of 9 cents per share to earnings of 1 cent per share over the same timeframe.

        "Title": "Nike and Alphabet downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls",
        "Author": "The Fly ",
        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades:\nSeaport Research upgraded International Paper (IP) to Buy from Neutral with a $52 price target. The selloff after Suzano dropped its takeover pursuit provides a \"reasonable entry point\" into International Paper, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nGuggenheim upgraded Guardant Health (GH) to Buy from Neutral with a $36 price target. Based on recent checks and an updated revenue model, the analyst's view has evolved on how Shield will ultimately be used as an every three year test for the colorectal cancer screening non-compliant market.\nBMO Capital upgraded SAP (SAP) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $237, up from $218. The analyst believe the company has a high degree of visibility into bookings and revenues over the next few years, largely driven by conversion of its \"large and sticky\" installed base to cloud offerings.\nJPMorgan upgraded Digital Realty Trust (DLR) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $175, up from $150. The analyst sees the company as a substantial beneficiary of cloud and artificial intelligence demand for data center capacity.\nCiti upgraded Cincinnati Financial (CINF) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $135, up from $126. The analyst says share downside is limited by less workers' comp exposure, higher comp loss picks and material casualty reserving actions already taken.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Nike (NKE) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $79, down from $114. The company reported another disappointing earnings print and reduced outlook, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Stifel also downgraded Nike to Hold from Buy with a price target of $88, down from $117, to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $78, down from $125, at UBS, and to Market Perform from Outperform at Raymond James. Nike was also downgraded at Barclays and JPMorgan. \nRosenblatt downgraded Alphabet (GOOGL) to Neutral from Buy with an $181 price target. The analyst sees \"multiple areas of transitional risk\" for Alphabet and recommends \"stepping back for a little while to see how the company handles it.\"\nWilliam Blair downgraded Travelers (TRV) to Market Perform from Outperform and Chubb (CB) to Underperform from Market Perform, both without price targets. The casualty side of the insurance business is being hit by rising levels of claims and losses, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nArgus downgraded Charles River (CRL) to Hold from Buy. The company continues to face headwinds to revenue growth due to cautious spending by the biotech industry, says the analyst.\nWells Fargo downgraded Acuity Brands (AYI) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $260, down from $295. The analyst says capital deployment and non residential demand uncertainties are two key overhangs that will make it too difficult to argue for multiple expansion at this juncture.\nTop 5 Initiations: \nJMP Securities initiated coverage of Affirm (AFRM) with a Market Perform rating and no price target. Over the past few years, Affirm's business model has diversified and strengthened, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nBaird initiated coverage of Synchrony Financial (SYF) with an Outperform rating and $56 price target. The firm calls Synchrony the number one domestic private label credit card platform, with tenured large retailer partnerships, and an experienced management team.\nBernstein initiated coverage of Stellantis (STLA) with a Market Perform rating and $23.50 price target. After a significant re-rating in 2023, Stellantis shares have declined 30% since late March and following the recent capital markets day, the company faces increasing risks to near term results, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\nGuggenheim assumed coverage of Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) with a Neutral rating and no price target. The firm says the company's ongoing global commercial launch of Casgevy, cell therapy expansion into autoimmune indication, and foray into cardiovascular via ANGPTL3 and other in vivo targets are the \"three pillars\" that underpin \"the CRSP 2.0 story.\"\nScotiabank last night initiated coverage of PagerDuty (PD) with a Sector Perform rating and $23 price target. The company has moved from an incident management tool to help IT operations and developers quicken their mean time to resolution to a broader operations cloud, which has expanded its total addressable market and fostered cross-selling capabilities, the analyst says.\n"

        "Title": "3 Powerful Examples of the Zacks Rank: Nvidia, Netflix, Alphabet",
        "Author": "  Derek Lewis ",
        "Text": "Stocks with rising earnings estimates have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 year after year, whereas stocks with falling earnings estimates have underperformed the S&P 500 year after year.\nThe Zacks Rank has made the process of identifying stocks with changing earnings estimates easy and very profitable. It\u2019s a reliable tool that helps you trade with confidence regardless of your trading style and/or risk tolerance.\nThe Zacks Rank uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 to \u2018Strong Sell.\u2019 Importantly, it allows individual investors to take advantage of trends in earnings estimate revisions and benefit from the power of institutional investors.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the Zacks Rank in action across several stocks, including beloved Nvidia NVDA, Netflix NFLX, and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\u00a0\nInvestor-favorite Nvidia reclaimed its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating on May 30th, with shares gaining nearly 10% since. The stock has held a favorable ranking for an extended period now, reflective of analysts\u2019 bullish outlooks regarding its Data Center sales.\nThe company\u2019s favorable earnings outlook is illustrated below.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRobust quarterly results are expected to keep coming, with the company forecasted to see 130% EPS growth on 110% higher sales in its upcoming release. The company\u2019s revenue growth has been remarkable over the years, as shown below.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAnd the growth picture remains bright thanks to demand for H200 and Blackwell that\u2019s currently well ahead of supply, with demand potentially exceeding supply well into next year. The H200\u2019s larger and faster memory fuels the acceleration of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) while advancing scientific computing for HPC workloads.\n\u00a0\nNetflix obtained the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) back on May 3, with shares up nearly 11% since. The company\u2019s latest set of quarterly results caused shares to face some pressure but have since erased the declines.\nAnalysts have raised their earnings expectations across the board, with positive revisions following the above-mentioned set of quarterly results.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe streaming giant enjoyed a solid quarter, posting $2.1 billion in free cash flow and seeing its year-to-date operating margin moving higher to 28.1% (20.6% in FY23). The company also maintained its free cash flow outlook of $6 billion for FY24 and repurchased 3.6 million shares throughout the period.\nThe company\u2019s growth outlook remains bright, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 52% earnings growth on 15% higher sales. The stock sports a Style Score of \u2018A\u2019 for Growth.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nAlphabet was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on April 30, with shares gaining 7% since. Like those above, the company\u2019s earnings outlook has become bright across the board.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nShares aren\u2019t overly expensive given the company\u2019s forecasted growth, as the current 21.7X forward 12-month earnings multiple sits right at the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 32.6X. Alphabet\u2019s forecasted to enjoy 31% EPS growth on 15% higher sales in its current fiscal year, with consensus expectations for FY25 alluding to an additional 13% earnings growth on 12% higher revenue.\nThe multiple also compares favorably to the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average of 27.1X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nAs the examples above show, listening to the Zacks Rank can consistently result in market-beating gains, as positive earnings estimate revisions provide the fuel needed to move higher.\nAll three stocks above \u2013 Nvidia NVDA, Netflix NFLX, and Alphabet GOOGL \u2013 presently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reflecting upward trending earnings estimate revisions.\nVisit Zacks Rank Education to learn more about using this proven system for market-beating gains.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 4, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Advanced Micro Devices AMD, NVIDIA NVDA, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nThe fight for AI supremacy between Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA is escalating, with both launching new chips at Computex 2024.\nAMD is playing catch-up to NVIDIA's dominance in the AI space, which has been riding on strong spending as the digital transformation (DX) of enterprises continues. Per IDC estimates, worldwide spending on DX is forecast to reach roughly $4 trillion in 2027, witnessing a CAGR of 16.2% between 2022 and 2027.\nGartner estimates spending on AI software to witness a CAGR of 19.1% between 2022 and 2027 to hit $297 billion in 2027. Generative AI (GenAI) software spending is expected to surge from 8% in 2023 to 35% by 2027. Deloitte expects enterprise spending on GenAI to increase 30% in 2024 from $16 billion in 2023.\nThis massive splurge by enterprises presents significant growth opportunities for both chipmakers.\nBoth AMD and NVIDIA are now focusing on the faster launch of AI-enabled chips to stay ahead of the competition.\nAt Computex 2024, AMD unveiled its Instinct accelerator roadmap that includes the new Instinct MI325X accelerator, which is planned to be available in fourth-quarter 2024. Instinct MI325X accelerator features 288GB of ultra-fast HBM3E memory that extends AMD's GenAI performance footprint.\nThe next-generation CDNA 4 architecture, expected in 2025, will power the AMD Instinct MI350 Series. It is expected to drive up to 35X better AI inference performance compared to the AMD Instinct MI300 Series with AMD CDNA 3. The CDNA \"Next\" architecture will power MI400 series accelerators planned for 2026.\nAMD unveiled the fifth generation of EPYC server processors (Turin) that leverage the Zen 5 core. It further expanded its portfolio with the launch of the Ryzen AI 300 Series, the third generation of AMD AI-enabled mobile processors, and Ryzen 9000 Series processors for laptop and desktop PCs.\nAt Computex, Microsoft, HP, Lenovo and Asus unveiled new PCs powered by third-gen AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors and AMD Ryzen 9000 Series desktop processors.\nNVIDIA recently expanded its portfolio with the announcement of the next-generation AI chip architecture, Rubin, which will leverage HBM4. This follows the March announcement of Blackwell, which is currently in production and is expected to ship to customers later this year.\nThe most valuable chip company now plans to release new AI chip models annually instead of its previous two-year update timeline. NVIDIA also announced a plethora of new tools and software models at Computex 2024.\nNVIDIA's yearly launch decision reflects the ongoing competitive frenzy in the AI chip market and its urgency to maintain its dominant position, which is not only threatened by AMD and Intel but also by initiatives taken by Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms.\nMicrosoft's Maia 100 is designed for AI purposes. The Maia 100 AI accelerator is capable of running cloud AI workloads like large language model training and inference. It is powered by a 5-nanometer TSMC process and has 105 billion transistors.\nAlphabet's Google has introduced the Axion central processing unit (CPU) to support its AI work in data centers. Axion processors are its first tailored Arm-based CPUs designed to deliver robust performance and energy efficiency. These CPUs deliver instances with up to 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances.\nMeta followed Google to introduce the next generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), which is a family of customized chips designed for Meta's AI workloads. MTIA will support new generative AI products and services, recommendation systems, and advanced AI research. The accelerator comes with an 8x8 grid of processing elements, which deliver increased dense compute performance (3.5x over MTIA v1) and a sparse compute performance.\nNVIDIA has returned a whopping 121.4% year to date, outperforming AMD, Microsoft and Alphabet's growth of 13.2%, 10.4% and 23.5%, respectively.\nNVDA is enjoying dominance in the AI-space thanks to its next-generation chips with high computing power that have been the top choice for enterprises. However, AMD, with its latest products, seems well-equipped to challenge NVDA not only in the data center market but also in the growing AI-enabled consumer PC market over the long haul.\nNVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Growth Score of A, a combination that offers a good investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology. A Momentum Score of B makes NVDA an attractive pick for investors. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nHowever, investors should wait for a better entry point for AMD, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), given the modest growth prospect in the near term. Moreover, AMD is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 40.11X compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry's 32.92X and NVIDIA's 38.12X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.
