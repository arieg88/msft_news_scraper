        "Text": "By Aditya Soni and Khushi Singh\n(Reuters) -Alphabet fell more than 3% on Wednesday on fears that its rising investments in AI infrastructure would squeeze margins and YouTube was facing tough competition for ad dollars.\nThe Google parent's capital expenditure rose more than expected in the second quarter to $13.2 billion as it invests heavily in infrastructure needed to support generative AI services, as well as compete with Microsoft.\nWhile Alphabet has been cutting costs through layoffs to protect profitability, several analysts said that seasonally higher hiring of fresh graduates and the earlier-than-usual Pixel launch will weigh on its margins in the third quarter.\nIts YouTube video-streaming service is also grappling with tough year-on-year comparisons and competition in the market for online ad videos from the likes of Amazon.com.\nYouTube ad sales grew 13% in the second quarter, compared with an increase of nearly 21% in the first quarter.\n\"Management sounded quite conservative about the outlook for the second half of the year,\" Bernstein analysts said.\n\"Perhaps this is Google's way of setting an easy bar for the new CFO to come in against the next quarter. Or perhaps there's some truth to the conservatism and we are entering an uncomfortable period for the digital advertising names with decelerating growth and rising costs.\"\nShares of other digital ad-reliant firms such as Meta Platforms, Snap and Pinterest were down between 3.2% and 4% as growth slowed at Alphabet's core Search business despite beating estimates.\nAlphabet was on track to lose around $60 billion in market value on Wednesday. Its stock has gained about 30% so far this year, benefiting from the rally in AI-related stocks.\nDespite the drop, many analysts were positive on Alphabet, pointing to signs that its AI efforts were driving up cloud revenue and that there was little disruption to Search revenue from the AI overviews it rolled out widely earlier this year.\nRevenue from cloud computing services rose 28.8%, faster than expectations, in a positive sign for enterprise spending.\n\"We continue to view Google as an AI winner and find core product improvements encouraging,\" Piper Sandler analysts said.\nAt least 25 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, pushing up the median view to $204. Alphabet's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio stands at 22.2, compared with AI chip firm Nvidia's 38.6, according to LSEG data.\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni and Khushi Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)\n"

        "Text": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) kicked off Big Tech\u2019s earnings season on Tuesday, giving Wall Street its first look at digital ad and cloud spending in the quarter. The company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue on the strength of Search ads and continued cloud growth, but fell short on YouTube ad sales.\nAlphabet also continues to spend billions building out its AI infrastructure. CFO Ruth Porat, who is transitioning to a new role as chief investment officer, told analysts during the company\u2019s earnings call that capital expenditures in the second quarter topped out at $13 billion, up from $12 billion in Q1. And the vast majority of that is going toward servers and data centers for AI capabilities.\nThe report sets the tone for the rest of the tech industry as it prepares to provide Wall Street with the latest on not just AI spending, but also how much that spending is paying off in actual revenue.\nSo far, Alphabet says it\u2019s seeing an uptick in cloud revenue, with some of that coming from interest in AI products. But CEO Sundar Pichai sidestepped a more direct question about when analysts can expect to start seeing a return on capital investments related to AI, saying that the spending is necessary for a long-term bet like AI and adding that in situations like this it\u2019s better to overinvest rather than underinvest and fall behind.\nUBS Global Research\u2019s Stephen Ju wrote in an investor note following Google\u2019s earnings call that it still isn\u2019t entirely clear when Google will start to reap the benefits of its AI investments.\n\u201cThe benefits [Google] is seeing in [Google Cloud Platform] on AI productization still seems difficult to discern, as is the full payoff that Google should see (we do not think potential revenue benefits will arrive until [the first half of 2025] at the earliest),\u201d Ju wrote.\n\u201cSo as far as we are concerned, the [return on invested capital] debate remains only partially resolved, especially as we are now contemplating what is a higher [capital expenditure] estimate for 2025 and 2026,\u201d he added.\nOther analysts were more upbeat on Google\u2019s AI efforts, with William Blair\u2019s Ralph Schackart pointing to Pichai\u2019s comment that some 2 billion users are accessing its Gemini AI model and that the company is building the model into its own products.\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt, meanwhile, pointed to Google\u2019s AI Overview for search helping to drive better customer engagement and creating more monetization opportunities as a positive in the company\u2019s report.\nStill, the one thing missing from all of this is a definitive number pointing to how much Google\u2019s AI investments are actually helping its bottom line. Pichai says investments will make a difference, but when exactly is still rather vague.\nAlphabet is just the first of the Big Tech names set to report their earnings this quarter, and you can all but guarantee investors will be searching for clues as to how those other companies\u2019 AI moves are paying off as well.\nMicrosoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) are slapping AI features onto their various products and services. Now we just have to see if they\u2019ll give any more insight than Alphabet had to offer.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 11 Biggest AI and Tech Stock Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades in July So Far.\u00a0Since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nAs soon as the latest softer-than-expected inflation data numbers were out, investors began to take profits from major tech stocks and pour money into small-cap companies amid hopes of rate cuts. However, some were quick to call the latest decline in tech stocks the end of the AI-fueled rally that has pushed stock valuations to eye-popping levels. But there are some Wall Street analysts who believe this is just a short-term trend and large tech and AI stocks have a lot of room to grow. Samantha McLemore, CIO of Patient Capital, said while talking to CNBC that the \u201cbull market continues and the path of least resistance is higher.\u201d\nThe analyst said that she has been in the market for a long time and investors have been worrying about the end of the bull market since 2009, while the S&P 500 has grown over 1000% (17% per year) since then.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any end to the bull market. We do think there\u2019s a good chance we see a rotation and small caps, the laggards, do much better in the second half of the year as the Fed starts to cut rates.\u201d\nSome analysts believe the latest decline in tech stocks is yet another opportunity for long-term investors to pile into AI stocks for gains. In this backdrop, we decided to take a look at the top AI stock upgrades and downgrades this month. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nDeepwater\u2019s Gene Munster thinks that Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is going to win the \u201cAI arms race.\u201d While talking to CNBC, the analyst said that Google search business is \u201cintact, no need to worry.\u201d Munster\u2019s thesis is based on his in-depth testing of several large language models and chatbots including Google\u2019s Gemini. Munster also thinks other chatbots do not offer a strong imperative for users to switch from Google search as of yet.\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives in a fresh note named Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) as one of the stocks that can benefit from the AI boom.\nAccording to a latest UBS report, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls in all three layers of the AI value chain \u2013 enabling, intelligence and application layer. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an AI enabling player because of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform, while Gemini makes it a key player in the intelligence layer. On the application layer, UBS believes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has an edge with its Duet AI assistant and advertising. All these catalysts make Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) a company that could benefit from the $1.2 trillion AI opportunity by 2027, UBS said.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the company is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note-taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrated with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) app urges users to sign up for \u2018Google One AI Premium\u2019 plan, which has a $19.99 price tag. \u00a0Google saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\nClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cCommunication services gains in the S&P 500 were driven mainly by\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (aka Google). The company has a dominant position in internet search and video advertising, and a solid cloud services business. Alphabet\u2019s initiation of a dividend in the quarter enabled us to take a small position. We see further meaningful revenue opportunities from AI innovations across its segments and may look to increase our holdings over time. Alphabet\u2019s exceptional balance sheet and improving cost efficiencies further solidify its strong position and growth prospects, and we expect its dividend will grow sharply over time.\nOverall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 11 Biggest AI and Tech Stock Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades in July So Far. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the \u201cvalue stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.\u201d\n\u201cWe look at the last year and a half, they\u2019ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap\u2026 just these seven companies.

These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.\u201d\nDamodaran\u2019s comments are important because he\u2019s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued.

The stock price rose after the U.S.-based communication services company reported first-quarter operating income growth of 31% versus the prior year.

Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 \u2013 showing meaningful progress in the company\u2019s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company\u2019s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power.

        "Author": "  Lucas Wong ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which is more commonly referred to as Google, recognized as one of the largest tech companies by revenue. It reported trailing revenue of $318.15 billion and holds the position of fourth most valuable company globally with a market cap of $2.17 trillion.\nAs we head into the second-quarter earnings season, the bull market continues to rise, driven largely by the Magnificent Seven. The S&P 500 has appreciated by around 17% year to date, while Alphabet has outperformed the benchmark, returning roughly 37%. Despite skeptics arguing that such appreciation is not sustainable, companies like Alphabet continue to defy these bearish predictions.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with CCL.\nRegardless of recent performance or all-time high share prices, I believe the Google parent company is poised for further growth, with significant revenue and earnings expansion on the horizon. While market retracements and a potential future recession are possible, the largest companies continue to expand, so I think the bullish case for the company is far from over. There remains a substantial opportunity for long-term investors. While shares may experience cooling periods, I expect them to end 2024 significantly higher than they are today.\nGOOG Data by GuruFocus\nDespite the general bullish sentiment, some analysts have been bearish on Alphabet due to perceived weaknesses in generative artificial intelligence. They cite potential negative revenue impacts from AI overviews, search share loss to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing and advertising share loss to retail media networks. Analysts suggest that while Google's historical financial performance is strong, its competitive position may deteriorate, preventing future repetition of such numbers. These views are not without merit; for instance, Google's search market share has been declining slowly over time. Concerns about AI's negative revenue impact are also valid as AI overviews currently occupy spaces traditionally reserved for ads, potentially reducing ad clicks and revenue.\nHowever, there are compelling reasons to believe Alphabet will thrive in the coming years. The company is a leader in AI, owns YouTube and the Play Store and has one of the world's fastest-growing cloud services businesses. Historically, the majority of its revenue has come from search, but this may change. Other segments, such as YouTube and cloud services, are growing rapidly and could drive future gains. I believe the company will sustain its upward trajectory due to its innovations and diversification, serving as major growth catalysts. The favorable market trends in AI and cloud computing, backed by the growth in digital advertising, support my bullish stance. Consequently, I consider the stock a great value today despite the risks it faces.\nAlphabet's Google is best known for its overwhelming dominance in the search engine market, where it holds over 90% market share. It owns the most popular search engine globally, responsible for approximately 70% of all global inquiries and receiving over 1 billion hits monthly. Its market dominance is built on a foundation of enhanced customer satisfaction, improved user experience and relentless innovation. The company's ability to consistently stay ahead of the competition in terms of technological advancements gives it a significant competitive edge. Google's complex and highly scalable algorithms are continuously improved, making them difficult for competitors to replicate. This persistent innovation and commitment to high-quality products will likely ensure its market dominance remains unchallenged in the long run.\nSource: StatCounter\nThe communication services company's substantial investment in artificial intelligence positions it well for future growth. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT has spiked demand for AI, leaving the chatbot market with immense growth potential. According to Precedence Research, the generative AI market is projected to increase from approximately $18 billion in 2023 to around $804 billion by 2033, representing a compound annual growth rate of 46.50%. While Google has faced some criticism regarding its handling of consumer-facing AI, such as inaccuracies in its Gemini AI output, recent developments have improved its reputation.\nFor instance, it announced AI enhancements for search, including AI-powered search summaries, which were well-received. Additionally, strong earnings releases, such as the first-quarter 2024 results, boosted investor sentiment. Despite initial setbacks, Alphabet is a leading player in the AI sector, with seven products boasting over a billion users each, a talented pool of AI engineers and numerous patents protecting its competitive edge. The Google parent's unique and superior Gemini technology positions it strategically to leverage AI's growth potential.\nSource: Precedence Research\nGoogle Cloud, while generating less revenue compared to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft's Azure, shows significant promise. It is now consistently profitable and continues to grow at a healthy rate. The cloud segment is experiencing the fastest revenue growth among the company's different divisions and has recently turned the corner on profitability.\nCEO Sundar Pichai noted Google announced over 1,000 new products and features in recent months, resonating with a wide range of customers. Notably, over 60% of funded generative AI startups and nearly 90% of unicorn companiess are Google Cloud customers, along with established businesses like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). As AWS and Azure have become profit drivers for Amazon and Microsoft respectively, there is no reason Google Cloud cannot achieve 30% operating margins by 2027-28. If growth continues at this pace, Google Cloud could contribute close to $5 billion in operating income per quarter by that time. Despite Google's already vast size, substantial growth opportunities remain in its Cloud and AI divisions.\nDespite Alphabet's massive scale, it continues to find ways to innovate and grow, maintaining impressive double-digit growth rates on an annualized basis. The company delivered exceptional first-quarter results that surpassed analysts' expectations. Its total revenue surged 15.40% year over year to $80.5 billion during the quarter. This consistent growth is a testament to Alphabet's strength across its various business segments. Notably, Google Search and other revenue climbed by 14.40% over the year-ago period to $46.2 billion. Concerns about Search being impacted by ChatGPT and Google Gemini have proven unfounded, as their presence has not cannibalized its revenue-generating ability in the slightest.\nSource: Alphabet\nYouTube ads revenue saw a substantial increase of 20.90% year over year to $8.10 billion, driven by higher advertising spend. Additionally, Google Cloud revenue leaped 28.40% over the year-ago period to $9.60 billion. Further, the business' rapid expansion continues, with its revenue growing by 169.61% over the past four years, reaching $35.21 billion in the trailing 12 months.\nAlphabet's profitability continues to rise alongside its revenue. In the first quarter, the company generated $25.47 billion in operating income, marking a 46.27% increase ($8.06 billion) year over year. This resulted in an operating margin of 31.63% compared to 24.96% in the prior-year quarter. The margin improvements were primarily driven by the expansion of Google Cloud's margins, coupled with a rebound in revenue growth.\nConsequently, significant expansion in Google Services' operating margins boosted the overall margin to 31.60%, the highest since the third quarter of 2021. This led to a 61% year-over-year increase in the company's GAAP earnings per share in the last quarter, further accelerating from 56% growth in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nSource: Alphabet\nIf Alphabet's exceptional business performance and growth prospects were not enough, its financial positioning puts it over the top. As of March 31, the company had $94.9 billion in net cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. This translates to approximately $7.57 per outstanding share. This robust financial position enables the company to continue investing in its business, fueling its growth cycle over the years.\nWall Street projects a consensus of 7.90% for sales growth and 13.20% for earnings per share growth over the next five years. While this reflects Alphabet's maturation as a business, I believe new innovations in AI could increase the revenue growth rate by an additional 2% to 4% annually over the next five years, resulting in a strong top-line growth trajectory.\nThe company's ability to sustain its growth and profitability makes it one of the best stocks to invest in for the long term. Despite potential market retracements and the inevitability of a future recession, I believe the Google parent will continue to thrive and deliver substantial returns to shareholders.\nDespite Alphabet's recent surge to an all-time high, I believe the stock is still undervalued. It is currently trading at a GAAP price-earnings ratio of 28.50, which is in line with its 10-year average. Interestingly, this multiple is slightly below the S&P 500 Index's multiple of 28.70 times. Given the recent growth rebound in its core advertising business and substantial margin expansions driven by increased capex on AI innovations, Alphabet is expected to generate $7.54 in earnings per share for fiscal 2024 and grow earnings by 30.24% over the next two years through 2026.\nOn a forward earnings basis, Alphabet trades at the most attractive valuation among the \"Magnificent Seven'' based on forward price-earnings multiples. This comparison highlights that the stock is significantly undervalued compared to its peers, such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), despite having more projected growth.\nSource: Alpha Spread\nWhile shares of Alphabet could experience short-term retracements, I believe they will continue to appreciate over the long term. Short-term fluctuations are a natural part of investing in equities, but the company's strong fundamentals and growth prospects make it a resilient investment.\nFurther, its board has approved an additional $70 billion in share repurchases and declared its first cash dividend of 20 cents, enhancing its capital allocation program. This additional allocation toward buybacks should provide a boost to earnings per share in the future.\nTo confirm Alphabet's undervaluation, let's consider a discounted cash flow analysis. Assuming a revenue CAGR of about 8% over the next five years and relatively stable net income margins, the cash flows discounted at 7.90% amount to $524.30 billion. The present value of the terminal value is $2.30 trillion, resulting in a total present value of $2.80 trillion. By adding a 3% terminal growth rate, we derive an approximate $230 fair value estimate. This represents 17% upside to today's price, indicating Alphabet is a compelling investment opportunity.\nSource: Alpha Spread\nSource: Alpha Spread\nAlphabet's unparalleled market dominance, especially in its search business, and its aggressive investments in AI and cloud services position it well for sustained growth. Despite facing challenges and a potentially cooling market, the company's robust financial performance and strategic advancements make it a compelling investment.

        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which is more commonly referred to as Google, recognized as one of the largest tech companies by revenue. It reported trailing revenue of $318.15 billion and holds the position of fourth most valuable company globally with a market cap of $2.17 trillion.\nAs we head into the second-quarter earnings season, the bull market continues to rise, driven largely by the Magnificent Seven. The S&P 500 has appreciated by around 17% year to date, while Alphabet has outperformed the benchmark, returning roughly 37%. Despite skeptics arguing that such appreciation is not sustainable, companies like Alphabet continue to defy these bearish predictions.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with CCL.\nRegardless of recent performance or all-time high share prices, I believe the Google parent company is poised for further growth, with significant revenue and earnings expansion on the horizon. While market retracements and a potential future recession are possible, the largest companies continue to expand, so I think the bullish case for the company is far from over. There remains a substantial opportunity for long-term investors. While shares may experience cooling periods, I expect them to end 2024 significantly higher than they are today.\nGOOG Data by GuruFocus\nDespite the general bullish sentiment, some analysts have been bearish on Alphabet due to perceived weaknesses in generative artificial intelligence. They cite potential negative revenue impacts from AI overviews, search share loss to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing and advertising share loss to retail media networks. Analysts suggest that while Google's historical financial performance is strong, its competitive position may deteriorate, preventing future repetition of such numbers. These views are not without merit; for instance, Google's search market share has been declining slowly over time. Concerns about AI's negative revenue impact are also valid as AI overviews currently occupy spaces traditionally reserved for ads, potentially reducing ad clicks and revenue.\nHowever, there are compelling reasons to believe Alphabet will thrive in the coming years. The company is a leader in AI, owns YouTube and the Play Store and has one of the world's fastest-growing cloud services businesses. Historically, the majority of its revenue has come from search, but this may change. Other segments, such as YouTube and cloud services, are growing rapidly and could drive future gains. I believe the company will sustain its upward trajectory due to its innovations and diversification, serving as major growth catalysts. The favorable market trends in AI and cloud computing, backed by the growth in digital advertising, support my bullish stance. Consequently, I consider the stock a great value today despite the risks it faces.\nAlphabet's Google is best known for its overwhelming dominance in the search engine market, where it holds over 90% market share. It owns the most popular search engine globally, responsible for approximately 70% of all global inquiries and receiving over 1 billion hits monthly. Its market dominance is built on a foundation of enhanced customer satisfaction, improved user experience and relentless innovation. The company's ability to consistently stay ahead of the competition in terms of technological advancements gives it a significant competitive edge. Google's complex and highly scalable algorithms are continuously improved, making them difficult for competitors to replicate. This persistent innovation and commitment to high-quality products will likely ensure its market dominance remains unchallenged in the long run.\nSource: StatCounter\nThe communication services company's substantial investment in artificial intelligence positions it well for future growth. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT has spiked demand for AI, leaving the chatbot market with immense growth potential. According to Precedence Research, the generative AI market is projected to increase from approximately $18 billion in 2023 to around $804 billion by 2033, representing a compound annual growth rate of 46.50%. While Google has faced some criticism regarding its handling of consumer-facing AI, such as inaccuracies in its Gemini AI output, recent developments have improved its reputation.\nFor instance, it announced AI enhancements for search, including AI-powered search summaries, which were well-received. Additionally, strong earnings releases, such as the first-quarter 2024 results, boosted investor sentiment. Despite initial setbacks, Alphabet is a leading player in the AI sector, with seven products boasting over a billion users each, a talented pool of AI engineers and numerous patents protecting its competitive edge. The Google parent's unique and superior Gemini technology positions it strategically to leverage AI's growth potential.\nSource: Precedence Research\nGoogle Cloud, while generating less revenue compared to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft's Azure, shows significant promise. It is now consistently profitable and continues to grow at a healthy rate. The cloud segment is experiencing the fastest revenue growth among the company's different divisions and has recently turned the corner on profitability.\nCEO Sundar Pichai noted Google announced over 1,000 new products and features in recent months, resonating with a wide range of customers. Notably, over 60% of funded generative AI startups and nearly 90% of unicorn companiess are Google Cloud customers, along with established businesses like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). As AWS and Azure have become profit drivers for Amazon and Microsoft respectively, there is no reason Google Cloud cannot achieve 30% operating margins by 2027-28. If growth continues at this pace, Google Cloud could contribute close to $5 billion in operating income per quarter by that time. Despite Google's already vast size, substantial growth opportunities remain in its Cloud and AI divisions.\nDespite Alphabet's massive scale, it continues to find ways to innovate and grow, maintaining impressive double-digit growth rates on an annualized basis. The company delivered exceptional first-quarter results that surpassed analysts' expectations. Its total revenue surged 15.40% year over year to $80.5 billion during the quarter. This consistent growth is a testament to Alphabet's strength across its various business segments. Notably, Google Search and other revenue climbed by 14.40% over the year-ago period to $46.2 billion. Concerns about Search being impacted by ChatGPT and Google Gemini have proven unfounded, as their presence has not cannibalized its revenue-generating ability in the slightest.\nSource: Alphabet\nYouTube ads revenue saw a substantial increase of 20.90% year over year to $8.10 billion, driven by higher advertising spend.

        "Text": "The arrival of artificial intelligence into the mainstream is a boon for the cloud computing industry. AI needs enormous amounts of data and computing power to execute tasks, both of which are readily available in a cloud environment.\nTwo prominent businesses benefiting from AI and its impact on the cloud computing market are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), commonly known as Supermicro.\nHere's how these two tech companies are reaping the rewards from the AI-driven cloud computing boom, and if you had to choose just one to invest in, which might prove the better long-term investment.\nAlphabet is perhaps best known for its ubiquitous Google search engine. But it also has a thriving cloud computing business called Google Cloud.\nThis division is experiencing rapid growth. In the first quarter, Google Cloud generated $9.6 billion, which is a 28% increase from 2023's $7.5 billion. It is now the third-largest cloud vendor in the world.\nGoogle Cloud offers several benefits to its business clients. Like all cloud offerings, customers can use it to augment or replace existing IT infrastructure, such as servers.\nMoreover, Alphabet makes its proprietary AI platform available to clients through Google Cloud, so they can create their own AI systems and apps. Instacart uses this feature to improve its customer service workflows.\nIn addition, according to CEO Sundar Pichai, \"Our Cloud business is now widely seen as the leader in cybersecurity.\" Its AI-powered cybersecurity features are why Pfizer adopted Google Cloud.\nSupermicro provides computer servers and storage solutions, the exact components critical to cloud computing. It focuses on high-performance computing products to cater to the needs of AI-optimized clouds in particular.\nSupermicro offers customers an array of options using a modular approach the company calls its \"Building Block Architecture.\" This approach allows it to quickly customize products to meet the technical requirements of its clientele.\nThe sudden AI-spurred demand for Supermicro's offerings led to massive sales growth for the company. In its fiscal Q3, ended March 31, Supermicro achieved revenue of $3.9 billion, a 200% increase year over year.\nThe company expects its outsized sales to continue. Supermicro is forecasting revenue of at least $5.1 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter. That's more than double the $2.2 billion in Q4 sales generated in the previous fiscal year.\nSupermicro added to its ability to grow revenue through an expanded product line. Its offerings now encompass additional IT infrastructure needs, such as power and liquid cooling systems.\nThe cloud computing market is expected to see multiyear growth thanks to AI, rising from $588 billion last year to $2.3 trillion by 2032. This growth makes both Alphabet and Supermicro compelling investments for the long term.\nHowever, deciding which stock is the better buy can be challenging. In this duel of cloud companies, several factors favor Alphabet.\nThe Google parent offers a more diversified business. It has a thriving digital advertising operation, where it's a market leader. Ad sales comprised $61.7 billion of the company's $80.5 billion in Q1 revenue.\nAlphabet is also a market leader in online search. Thanks to Google's popularity, Alphabet has a trove of data to feed into and strengthen its AI platform.\nAlso, Supermicro battles in a competitive space with rivals including Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nCompetition has led to pricing pressure, causing a decline in Supermicro's gross margin to 15.6% in fiscal Q3 from 17.7% in the prior year. Supermicro expects its gross margin to decline further in fiscal Q4.\nAnother factor to consider is valuation. Using the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), a widely used metric to assess a stock's value, Alphabet is the winner. This chart shows that Supermicro's valuation has soared in 2024.\nWhile Supermicro's P/E ratio has come down in recent months, shares remain pricier than Alphabet's.\nIn addition, Supermicro is not cash-flow positive. It spent $2.7 billion over the past three quarters building up its product inventory. This resulted in negative free cash flow (FCF) of $1.6 billion in fiscal Q3.\nAlphabet isn't burdened with maintaining an inventory of goods to sell, helping it to generate prodigious FCF of $16.8 billion in Q1. Over the trailing 12 months, the company's FCF was $69.1 billion.\nIts tremendous FCF allows Alphabet to comfortably afford a dividend. Supermicro doesn't offer a dividend.\nWhile both companies are enjoying rising revenue thanks to growth in the cloud computing sector, given Alphabet's market-leading products, strong FCF, more diversified business, and better stock valuation, Alphabet is the superior investment at this time.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

Analysts were anticipating earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $84.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That's a jump from the same period last year of 31% and 14%, respectively, when the company reported earnings per share of $1.44 on revenue of $74.6 billion.\nAdvertising revenue topped $64.6 billion versus analysts' expectations of $64.5 billion, and up from $58.1 billion last year. YouTube ad revenue, however, fell short, with the segment bringing in $8.66 billion versus expectations of $8.95 billion.\nShares of Alphabet were down roughly 3% in premarket trading on Wednesday.\nGoogle saw cloud revenue of $10.35 billion and operating income of $1.17 billion. That's better than analyst expectations of $10.1 billion and operating income of $982.2 million and higher than the $8 billion in revenue and $395 million in operating income the company reported in Q2 2023.\nAlphabet shares are up 30% year to date. Shares of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are up 18% and 22% year to date, respectively. All three companies are pouring money into building out their generative AI capabilities, spending lavishly on data centers capable of powering the AI models they offer via their cloud service platforms.\nIn the second quarter, Alphabet reported spending $2.2 billion building AI models across its DeepMind and Google Research organizations. That's up from $1.1 billion in Q2 2023. When exactly AI starts to generate revenue for Google\u2019s Cloud business, let alone its ad segment, is still up in the air.\n\u201cIt is still too early to count on AI benefits as most [companies] remain in pilot mode, and material AI [revenue] is more likely a 2025-26 event,\u201d Jefferies analyst Brent Thill wrote in a recent client note ahead of Alphabet's earnings announcement.\nGoogle is still trying to find its footing with AI Overview, the generative AI feature that shows up at the top of Google Search results pages. In May, the company rolled out the search function, only for users to quickly discover that its answers weren\u2019t always accurate, with now-famous responses telling users to put glue in their pizza or to eat a rock every day. Google responded by pulling back some of the generative AI features.\nWhile it spends on AI, Alphabet has been cutting in other areas, including headcount. In Q2, the company reported having 179,582 employees, down from 181,798 in the same period last year.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) kicked off Big Tech\u2019s earnings season on Tuesday, giving Wall Street its first look at digital ad and cloud spending in the quarter. The company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue on the strength of Search ads and continued cloud growth, but fell short on YouTube ad sales.\nAlphabet also continues to spend billions building out its AI infrastructure. CFO Ruth Porat, who is transitioning to a new role as chief investment officer, told analysts during the company\u2019s earnings call that capital expenditures in the second quarter topped out at $13 billion, up from $12 billion in Q1. And the vast majority of that is going toward servers and data centers for AI capabilities.\nThe report sets the tone for the rest of the tech industry as it prepares to provide Wall Street with the latest on not just AI spending, but also how much that spending is paying off in actual revenue.\nSo far, Alphabet says it\u2019s seeing an uptick in cloud revenue, with some of that coming from interest in AI products. But CEO Sundar Pichai sidestepped a more direct question about when analysts can expect to start seeing a return on capital investments related to AI, saying that the spending is necessary for a long-term bet like AI and adding that in situations like this it\u2019s better to overinvest rather than underinvest and fall behind.\nUBS Global Research\u2019s Stephen Ju wrote in an investor note following Google\u2019s earnings call that it still isn\u2019t entirely clear when Google will start to reap the benefits of its AI investments.\n\u201cThe benefits [Google] is seeing in [Google Cloud Platform] on AI productization still seems difficult to discern, as is the full payoff that Google should see (we do not think potential revenue benefits will arrive until [the first half of 2025] at the earliest),\u201d Ju wrote.\n\u201cSo as far as we are concerned, the [return on invested capital] debate remains only partially resolved, especially as we are now contemplating what is a higher [capital expenditure] estimate for 2025 and 2026,\u201d he added.\nOther analysts were more upbeat on Google\u2019s AI efforts, with William Blair\u2019s Ralph Schackart pointing to Pichai\u2019s comment that some 2 billion users are accessing its Gemini AI model and that the company is building the model into its own products.\nWedbush analyst Scott Devitt, meanwhile, pointed to Google\u2019s AI Overview for search helping to drive better customer engagement and creating more monetization opportunities as a positive in the company\u2019s report.\nStill, the one thing missing from all of this is a definitive number pointing to how much Google\u2019s AI investments are actually helping its bottom line. Pichai says investments will make a difference, but when exactly is still rather vague.\nAlphabet is just the first of the Big Tech names set to report their earnings this quarter, and you can all but guarantee investors will be searching for clues as to how those other companies\u2019 AI moves are paying off as well.\nMicrosoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) are slapping AI features onto their various products and services. Now we just have to see if they\u2019ll give any more insight than Alphabet had to offer.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

That exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates of $12.2 billion.\nGoogle once had a head start in the AI race because it developed much of the technology underpinning popular chatbots.

Investors are also eyeing Google Cloud as the unit with the most potential to boost growth at Alphabet overall, especially as its search business matures.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve certainly seen the benefit of our strength in AI, AI infrastructure, as well as generative AI solutions for cloud customers,\u201d Alphabet Chief Investment Officer Ruth Porat said on a call with media. \u201cThere is no question customers are turning to us as they are building out their capabilities.\u201d\nIn May, Google announced AI Overviews for search written by generative artificial intelligence technology, but the launch of the feature didn\u2019t go well. Some AI Overviews offered embarrassing suggestions, advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza, for example. Still, quarterly search advertising revenue was $48.5 billion, compared with the average analyst projection for $47.6 billion.\n\u201cIf it takes more effort for consumers to go anywhere else to search,\u201d said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, an analyst with EMarketer, \u201cGoogle is going to keep monetizing search traffic higher than any of its competitors.\u201d\nYouTube reported $8.66 billion in revenue, compared with analysts\u2019 average estimate of $8.95 billion. Of Alphabet\u2019s various businesses, YouTube has been the most vulnerable to swings in the digital-ad market.\nAlphabet\u2019s Other Bets \u2014 a collection of moonshot units that includes the life sciences business Verily and the self-driving car effort Waymo \u2014 brought in $365 million in revenue while posting an operating loss of $1.13 billion. That was steeper than analysts\u2019 projection for a loss of $1.07 billion. Alphabet has recently put pressure on its bets to spin off as independent startups, rather than becoming business units of their parent company.\nIn its latest report, Alphabet indicated that it has $100.7 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable investments, down from the $108 billion it reported in the first quarter. In recent months, Google showed interest in acquiring two companies, either of which would have been the biggest-ever purchase for the internet giant \u2014 but both times, the deals fell apart. The acquisitions, for HubSpot Inc. and Wiz Inc., would have strengthened the company\u2019s cloud and cybersecurity offerings, helping it to compete with its tech rivals.\n\u201cWe are always looking for good opportunities to diversify the portfolio and will continue to do so if we find the right combination of factors, including value,\u201d Porat said, without commenting on the Wiz talks. \u201cRegulatory scrutiny is not new for us, and we have successfully managed regulatory reviews of many large deals in the past.\u201d\nLater this month, Anat Ashkenazi, a veteran Eli Lilly & Co. executive, will join the search giant as chief financial officer. Porat, Alphabet\u2019s longest serving CFO, will stay on as president and chief investment officer, spending more time working on the company\u2019s portfolio of other bets.\n--With assistance from Ed Ludlow and Shona Ghosh.\n(Updates share price.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Miseducation of America\u2019s Nurse Practitioners\n\u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship\nJoe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy\u2019s New Kingmaker\nDisney Bets on Deadpool, Wolverine and Dirty Jokes to Save Marvel\nThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Why Google Parent Alphabet Is the Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock in the \"Magnificent Seven\"",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) delivered strong revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter of 2024. However, because YouTube advertising revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations, the stock tumbled 5% following the Q2 update.\nMany investors are missing the forest for the trees with Alphabet. Here's why it's arguably the best artificial intelligence (AI) stock in the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nAlphabet continues to trounce the biggest and smallest Magnificent Seven stocks -- Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla\u00a0-- in revenue growth. Its earnings are growing much faster than theirs, too.\nDespite the YouTube advertising disappointment, Alphabet's Q2 revenue jumped 14% year over year, with earnings soaring nearly 29%. It's important to note that YouTube ad revenue increased 13%.\nAlthough that wasn't as much as analysts expected, the growth wasn't too shabby. That's especially the case considering there was no longer a year-over-year boost from the YouTube TV price increase that took effect in 2023 Q2.\nApple hasn't reported its Q2 results yet. However, the company's revenue declined 4% year over year in its quarter ending March 30, 2024, with earnings slipping 2% lower. Perhaps Apple's new AI capabilities will reignite growth with the upcoming launch of its new iPhone model, but the company has a long way to go before it catches up with Alphabet.\nTesla's revenue increased by a paltry 2% year over year in Q2, and net income plunged 45%. It's fair to say this Magnificent Seven stock isn't looking all that magnificent right now.\nLike Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) hasn't announced its results for the most recent quarter. However, the tech-giant's growth in the quarter ending March 31, 2024 was in the same ballpark as Alphabet's in Q2.\nThe big advantage Alphabet has over Microsoft, though, is that it isn't outsourcing AI development. Microsoft's success stems in large part from its partnership with OpenAI. Without OpenAI's GPT-4, I suspect Microsoft would be floundering.\nMeanwhile, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai proclaimed in the company's Q2 earnings call this week, \"[W]e are in a strong position to control our destiny as the technology [AI] evolves.\" He added, \"Importantly, we are innovating at every layer of the AI stack, from chips to agents and beyond, a huge strength.\" I agree with Pichai's assessment.\nAlphabet and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) share a lot in common. Both companies are effectively harnessing AI to improve profitability and operate fast-growing cloud units that are benefiting from the generative AI boom. Both have developed their own AI chips but still depend heavily on Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs).\nAmazon delivered stronger earnings growth in its last reported quarter than Alphabet did in Q2, although its revenue growth was slightly lower than Alphabet's. Nvidia blew past all other Magnificent Seven members on both the top and bottom lines.\nHowever, Alphabet beats Amazon and NVidia on one important front: valuation. The Google parent's shares trade at a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.34. Amazon's and Nvidia's PEG ratios are 1.98 and 1.39, respectively.\nThat leaves Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). The social media leader's revenue and earnings soared much more in its last reported quarter than Alphabet's did in Q2. Meta isn't outsourcing its AI development like Microsoft, and its PEG of 1.16 is even lower than Alphabet's.\nAll of this might seem to make Meta the best AI stock in the Magnificent Seven, but I think Alphabet's growth wild card is more compelling than Meta's. And that's enough to put Alphabet on top for me.\nWhat are these companies' growth wild cards? For Alphabet, it's the company's Waymo self-driving car technology unit and \"other bets.\" For Meta, it's the metaverse.\nThe metaverse could be as big an opportunity as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg predicts. I feel much more confident, though, in the opportunity the robotaxi market presents for Waymo.\nDo I think there are solid arguments that some of the other Magnificent Seven members could be the best AI stock in the group? Absolutely. Although I think Alphabet stands at the top now, my opinion could easily be swayed by new developments in the fast-moving AI space.\nThe reality is that all seven stocks could be huge winners because of AI tailwinds over the next decade and beyond. There's no need for investors to try to choose which is the best when you can buy several or all of them.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Lucas Wong ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which is more commonly referred to as Google, recognized as one of the largest tech companies by revenue. It reported trailing revenue of $318.15 billion and holds the position of fourth most valuable company globally with a market cap of $2.17 trillion.\nAs we head into the second-quarter earnings season, the bull market continues to rise, driven largely by the Magnificent Seven. The S&P 500 has appreciated by around 17% year to date, while Alphabet has outperformed the benchmark, returning roughly 37%. Despite skeptics arguing that such appreciation is not sustainable, companies like Alphabet continue to defy these bearish predictions.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with CCL.\nRegardless of recent performance or all-time high share prices, I believe the Google parent company is poised for further growth, with significant revenue and earnings expansion on the horizon. While market retracements and a potential future recession are possible, the largest companies continue to expand, so I think the bullish case for the company is far from over. There remains a substantial opportunity for long-term investors. While shares may experience cooling periods, I expect them to end 2024 significantly higher than they are today.\nGOOG Data by GuruFocus\nDespite the general bullish sentiment, some analysts have been bearish on Alphabet due to perceived weaknesses in generative artificial intelligence. They cite potential negative revenue impacts from AI overviews, search share loss to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing and advertising share loss to retail media networks. Analysts suggest that while Google's historical financial performance is strong, its competitive position may deteriorate, preventing future repetition of such numbers. These views are not without merit; for instance, Google's search market share has been declining slowly over time. Concerns about AI's negative revenue impact are also valid as AI overviews currently occupy spaces traditionally reserved for ads, potentially reducing ad clicks and revenue.\nHowever, there are compelling reasons to believe Alphabet will thrive in the coming years. The company is a leader in AI, owns YouTube and the Play Store and has one of the world's fastest-growing cloud services businesses. Historically, the majority of its revenue has come from search, but this may change. Other segments, such as YouTube and cloud services, are growing rapidly and could drive future gains. I believe the company will sustain its upward trajectory due to its innovations and diversification, serving as major growth catalysts. The favorable market trends in AI and cloud computing, backed by the growth in digital advertising, support my bullish stance. Consequently, I consider the stock a great value today despite the risks it faces.\nAlphabet's Google is best known for its overwhelming dominance in the search engine market, where it holds over 90% market share. It owns the most popular search engine globally, responsible for approximately 70% of all global inquiries and receiving over 1 billion hits monthly. Its market dominance is built on a foundation of enhanced customer satisfaction, improved user experience and relentless innovation. The company's ability to consistently stay ahead of the competition in terms of technological advancements gives it a significant competitive edge. Google's complex and highly scalable algorithms are continuously improved, making them difficult for competitors to replicate. This persistent innovation and commitment to high-quality products will likely ensure its market dominance remains unchallenged in the long run.\nSource: StatCounter\nThe communication services company's substantial investment in artificial intelligence positions it well for future growth. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT has spiked demand for AI, leaving the chatbot market with immense growth potential. According to Precedence Research, the generative AI market is projected to increase from approximately $18 billion in 2023 to around $804 billion by 2033, representing a compound annual growth rate of 46.50%. While Google has faced some criticism regarding its handling of consumer-facing AI, such as inaccuracies in its Gemini AI output, recent developments have improved its reputation.\nFor instance, it announced AI enhancements for search, including AI-powered search summaries, which were well-received. Additionally, strong earnings releases, such as the first-quarter 2024 results, boosted investor sentiment. Despite initial setbacks, Alphabet is a leading player in the AI sector, with seven products boasting over a billion users each, a talented pool of AI engineers and numerous patents protecting its competitive edge. The Google parent's unique and superior Gemini technology positions it strategically to leverage AI's growth potential.\nSource: Precedence Research\nGoogle Cloud, while generating less revenue compared to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft's Azure, shows significant promise. It is now consistently profitable and continues to grow at a healthy rate. The cloud segment is experiencing the fastest revenue growth among the company's different divisions and has recently turned the corner on profitability.\nCEO Sundar Pichai noted Google announced over 1,000 new products and features in recent months, resonating with a wide range of customers. Notably, over 60% of funded generative AI startups and nearly 90% of unicorn companiess are Google Cloud customers, along with established businesses like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). As AWS and Azure have become profit drivers for Amazon and Microsoft respectively, there is no reason Google Cloud cannot achieve 30% operating margins by 2027-28. If growth continues at this pace, Google Cloud could contribute close to $5 billion in operating income per quarter by that time. Despite Google's already vast size, substantial growth opportunities remain in its Cloud and AI divisions.\nDespite Alphabet's massive scale, it continues to find ways to innovate and grow, maintaining impressive double-digit growth rates on an annualized basis. The company delivered exceptional first-quarter results that surpassed analysts' expectations. Its total revenue surged 15.40% year over year to $80.5 billion during the quarter. This consistent growth is a testament to Alphabet's strength across its various business segments. Notably, Google Search and other revenue climbed by 14.40% over the year-ago period to $46.2 billion. Concerns about Search being impacted by ChatGPT and Google Gemini have proven unfounded, as their presence has not cannibalized its revenue-generating ability in the slightest.\nSource: Alphabet\nYouTube ads revenue saw a substantial increase of 20.90% year over year to $8.10 billion, driven by higher advertising spend. Additionally, Google Cloud revenue leaped 28.40% over the year-ago period to $9.60 billion. Further, the business' rapid expansion continues, with its revenue growing by 169.61% over the past four years, reaching $35.21 billion in the trailing 12 months.\nAlphabet's profitability continues to rise alongside its revenue. In the first quarter, the company generated $25.47 billion in operating income, marking a 46.27% increase ($8.06 billion) year over year. This resulted in an operating margin of 31.63% compared to 24.96% in the prior-year quarter. The margin improvements were primarily driven by the expansion of Google Cloud's margins, coupled with a rebound in revenue growth.\nConsequently, significant expansion in Google Services' operating margins boosted the overall margin to 31.60%, the highest since the third quarter of 2021. This led to a 61% year-over-year increase in the company's GAAP earnings per share in the last quarter, further accelerating from 56% growth in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nSource: Alphabet\nIf Alphabet's exceptional business performance and growth prospects were not enough, its financial positioning puts it over the top. As of March 31, the company had $94.9 billion in net cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. This translates to approximately $7.57 per outstanding share. This robust financial position enables the company to continue investing in its business, fueling its growth cycle over the years.\nWall Street projects a consensus of 7.90% for sales growth and 13.20% for earnings per share growth over the next five years. While this reflects Alphabet's maturation as a business, I believe new innovations in AI could increase the revenue growth rate by an additional 2% to 4% annually over the next five years, resulting in a strong top-line growth trajectory.\nThe company's ability to sustain its growth and profitability makes it one of the best stocks to invest in for the long term. Despite potential market retracements and the inevitability of a future recession, I believe the Google parent will continue to thrive and deliver substantial returns to shareholders.\nDespite Alphabet's recent surge to an all-time high, I believe the stock is still undervalued. It is currently trading at a GAAP price-earnings ratio of 28.50, which is in line with its 10-year average. Interestingly, this multiple is slightly below the S&P 500 Index's multiple of 28.70 times. Given the recent growth rebound in its core advertising business and substantial margin expansions driven by increased capex on AI innovations, Alphabet is expected to generate $7.54 in earnings per share for fiscal 2024 and grow earnings by 30.24% over the next two years through 2026.\nOn a forward earnings basis, Alphabet trades at the most attractive valuation among the \"Magnificent Seven'' based on forward price-earnings multiples. This comparison highlights that the stock is significantly undervalued compared to its peers, such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), despite having more projected growth.\nSource: Alpha Spread\nWhile shares of Alphabet could experience short-term retracements, I believe they will continue to appreciate over the long term. Short-term fluctuations are a natural part of investing in equities, but the company's strong fundamentals and growth prospects make it a resilient investment.\nFurther, its board has approved an additional $70 billion in share repurchases and declared its first cash dividend of 20 cents, enhancing its capital allocation program. This additional allocation toward buybacks should provide a boost to earnings per share in the future.\nTo confirm Alphabet's undervaluation, let's consider a discounted cash flow analysis. Assuming a revenue CAGR of about 8% over the next five years and relatively stable net income margins, the cash flows discounted at 7.90% amount to $524.30 billion. The present value of the terminal value is $2.30 trillion, resulting in a total present value of $2.80 trillion. By adding a 3% terminal growth rate, we derive an approximate $230 fair value estimate. This represents 17% upside to today's price, indicating Alphabet is a compelling investment opportunity.\nSource: Alpha Spread\nSource: Alpha Spread\nAlphabet's unparalleled market dominance, especially in its search business, and its aggressive investments in AI and cloud services position it well for sustained growth. Despite facing challenges and a potentially cooling market, the company's robust financial performance and strategic advancements make it a compelling investment. The stock's undervaluation relative to peers further underscores its potential for long-term gains, solidifying its status as a top pick for investors looking to capitalize on the ongoing tech revolution.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

This feature is aimed at improving the user experience and ensuring accurate directions for businesses or locations.Alphabet launched a free version of Magic Editor for Google Photos, allowing Android users to manipulate images, resize and erase parts, apply background pre-sets and select with tap, circle, or brush.It also introduced a \u201cLookup\u201d reverse number shortcut feature on the Google Phone app on Pixel devices, further bolstering its Android app offerings.Strengthening Android capabilities is expected to drive the performance of the Google Services segment, which, in turn, will contribute to the overall financial performance of the company in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $291.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.6%.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Undervalued Stocks to Buy According to Reddit. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other undervalued stocks. If interested, read our recent piece on the 10 Most Undervalued Stocks to Buy for Under $20.\nRetail investors often discuss their investments on platforms such as Reddit and have become a major market force in recent years. According to a report, inflows from retail investors in the stock market between 2014 and 2019 averaged around $200 million, with a peak of $730 million in 2015. The figure spiked to $1.2 billion in 2020, with daily flows reaching $1.48 billion in 2021. Over the next couple of years, the value of inflows hovered between $1-1.4 billion per day, driven by commission-free online trading platforms and stimulus payments from the government. The surge in investor inflows is also owed to the pandemic, during which low interest rates and bond purchases by the Federal Reserve pumped heavy money into the American financial system.\nThe year 2024 has already been a healthy year for the American stock market, driven by a strong performance by technology stocks. Tom Lee, the co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, is bullish on the ongoing fiscal year and anticipates the market to triple in size by the end of the decade.\nThe two major factors driving Lee's bullish projection were the global labor shortage and a surge in the population of millennials. He mentions how millennials are the largest generation shaping the economy and are set to inherit big as we approach the generational wealth transfer of at least $80 trillion. According to a report, by 2030, millennials will have five times more wealth compared to what they have today. Moreover, the past two incidents of global labor shortage led to major spikes in technology stocks, and Lee is expecting the same again this time. However, he also warns of risks that could undermine his positive outlook, including AI backfiring, global recession, and geopolitical instability.\nThis uncertainty about the stock market, coupled with stocks' volatility, makes it difficult for investors to ascertain the true value of the stock they want to invest in. American billionaire hedge fund manager, Bill Ackman, in May this year, discussed the current state of value investors and acknowledged that predicting the durability of a stock is far harder than building a financial model in the world of investment. Responding to a question about the use of AI to analyze stock investments and financial markets, Ackman stated that AI platforms might help in decision-making over the short run, but there is no guarantee that they would continue working over the long run.\nValue investors purchase stocks they believe have a high value but their share prices do not reflect the stock's actual worth, aiming to benefit when the market corrects itself. If the correct stocks are picked, it can lead to hefty returns for the investors through share price performance. One way of picking out the right stocks is noticing what the hedge funds are doing. Insider Monkey regularly covers top hedge fund stocks across industries for each quarter, and you can keep up with the information by following our website and subscribing to our newsletter. One such example is the 10 Best Aerospace and Defense Stocks to Buy Now.\nWe went through several threads on Reddit to identify the most talked about top undervalued stocks according to investors on the platform. After gathering a list of companies, we went through a stock screener to verify that these stocks were undervalued. Then we sorted and listed the stocks in ascending order of how frequently they were mentioned on Reddit for being undervalued. In cases where two or more stocks were level on the metric, we outranked one over the other based on hedge fund sentiment about the stocks in question. Insider Monkey's database of 920 hedge funds for Q1 2024 was used for that purpose.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nInvestors on Reddit that consider the stock undervalued: 20\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the world's most valuable and largest companies by revenue. It was formed in 2015 after a restructuring of Google, which made Alphabet Inc. the parent company of Google and its subsidiaries. It is the best undervalued stock to buy according to Reddit. Their opinion is backed by hedge fund sentiment as well, with 165 hedge funds bullish on the stock as of Q1, 2024. It took the company 15 years to record $100 billion in revenues, but only six years to jump from $100 billion to over $300 billion worth of annual revenue, driven by Google Search, YouTube, and Google Cloud, with rapid progress being observed in Gemini as well.\nThese services drove the company's strong performance during the first quarter of 2024 as well, in which Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) smashed earnings expectations, posting an EPS of $1.89 against forecasts of $1.51. There is consensus among all major rating firms on the stock\u2019s Buy rating, with an average share price target of $191.24, an upside of 6.61% from its current level. There is optimism for the stock price appreciation as investor sentiment improves about the company's artificial-intelligence investments.\nThe quarterly results were received well by existing investors. Lakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 \u2013 showing meaningful progress in the company\u2019s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company\u2019s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs (chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it\u2019s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.\nThe company expects its operating margins to further expand in 2024. Bank of America has also forecasted growth in its cash flows over the coming years, to be up from $69 billion in 2023 to $118 billion by 2026. That said, bears believe the stock faces significant threats from emerging trends such as gen AI chatbots, with some analysts including Gartner expecting a decline of 25% in traditional search engine use by 2026.\nOverall GOOG ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best undervalued stocks to buy according to Reddit.

        "Title": "Is Alphabet Stock a Buy?",
        "Author": "  Robert Izquierdo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) investors should be quite pleased with its performance over the past year. The stock was trading around $115 last July, but it hit a high of $191.75 on July 10 (a 67% rise).\nSeveral factors helped to propel shares, including the distribution of the first dividend in its history. Given the stock has already risen so much, have potential new shareholders missed out?\nNot necessarily, although Alphabet's future is murky right now, pending the outcomes of two crucial antitrust lawsuits against the company. Here's a deeper dive to assess if now is a good time to buy shares.\nAlphabet's excellent first-quarter performance contributed to the stock's rise this year. Its revenue of $80.5 billion was a 15% jump from $69.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. The impressive financial results included operating margin improving to 32% from 25% last year. Quarterly net income was $23.7 billion, compared to $15.1 billion a year ago. This led to diluted earnings per share of $1.89, versus $1.17 last year.\nThe company's streak of strong free cash flow (FCF) also continued. FCF was $16.8 billion in the quarter and $69.1 billion for the trailing 12 months. Alphabet ended the quarter with an exceptional balance sheet. Assets totaled $407.4 billion compared to $114.5 billion in liabilities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $108.1 billion.\nThe icing on the cake was the company's announcement of its first dividend: $0.20 per share quarterly, which translates to a 0.4% yield.\nThe company's financial success is due to growth in several of its businesses. Its advertising operations are flourishing thanks to increased spending on digital ads.\nThe global digital ad market is forecast to see double-digit growth in 2024 and in subsequent years. Advertising income made up $61.7 billion of Alphabet's $80.5 billion in quarterly revenue. The company is also increasing sales in its\u00a0Google Cloud segment: $9.6 billion, up from $7.5 billion in 2023. It is now the third-largest cloud vendor in the world.\nLastly, Alphabet generates a significant chunk of sales from subscriptions and other services, such as its ad-free YouTube Premium offering. These sources reached $8.7 billion in revenue, up from the prior year's $7.4 billion.\nThese excellent results, combined with a newly established dividend, provide compelling reasons to buy the stock.\nAnd yet, there are some potential issues to keep in mind as you investigate this stock.\nAlphabet faces a potential risk from the antitrust cases brought against it by the U.S. government. One case involves the Google search engine and the other targets Alphabet's lucrative digital advertising business. The trial in the former case concluded in May, and is awaiting a judge's decision. The digital ad trial is scheduled to begin in September. Both outcomes could affect shares substantially because these lawsuits jeopardize the biggest parts of the business.\nFor instance, the search-engine case encompasses Alphabet's contracts with other companies, such as Apple, that make Google Search the default choice in their various products. These deals helped Google attain over a 90% market share, and in the first quarter, Google Search contributed $46.2 billion of Alphabet's $80.5 billion in revenue. The government argued that these deals give Google a monopoly in search.\nAnother consideration in whether to buy the stock is the perspective of Wall Street analysts. The current consensus among the analysts gives Alphabet an overweight rating with a median share price of $195.25. That suggests Alphabet stock doesn't have much upside over the next 12 months or so from its current price of around $188.\nSo depending on your risk tolerance, you might want to wait to buy shares until the antitrust cases are resolved.\nAlphabet could emerge from the lawsuits victorious or with a manageable fine. In that event, given the company's growth across multiple lines of business, its prodigious FCF, and other strong financials, the stock is a worthwhile buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Mega-cap technology giant Alphabet GOOGL recently reported quarterly results, helping kick off the reporting cycle for the Mag 7 group. So far, we\u2019ve also heard from Tesla, with the rest of the group\u2019s results expected in the coming weeks.\nThe reaction to Alphabet\u2019s quarterly release was initially negative, raising the eyebrows of some and halting recent momentum. The results provide some read-through for Meta Platforms\u2019 META upcoming release, particularly concerning advertising results.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the results.\n\u00a0\nAlphabet\u2019s quarterly release was overall positive, with the company enjoying 31% EPS growth on nearly 14% higher sales. Both figures exceeded our consensus expectations, building on its recent streak of quarterly positivity.\nAdvertising revenue reached $64.6 billion, showing a 12% climb relative to the year-ago figure. Cloud also showed great growth, with revenues of $10.3 billion nearly 30% higher year-over-year and reflecting a quarterly record.\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s total revenue on a quarterly basis.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe knee-jerk reaction following the print was likely a reflection of profit-taking after a strong run, with the CEO\u2019s comments concerning artificial intelligence (AI) CapEx spooking some. CapEx throughout the period totaled $13.2 billion, higher than expected due to investments in servers and data centers.\nWhen asked about CapEx levels, CEO Sundar Pichai said, \u2018The one way I think about it is when you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here. Even in scenarios where if it turns out we are overinvesting, these are infrastructure which are widely useful for us, they have long useful lives, and we can apply it across and we can work through that.\u2019\nInvestors will undoubtedly remain curious about the return on AI investment, but the company overall maintains a bright outlook concerning the future benefits. Analysts have kept their earnings expectations for its current fiscal year stable following the release, with the $7.65 per share expected suggesting 32% Y/Y growth.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSo, while shares had a rough initial reaction, the company\u2019s print was overall highly positive, with cloud and advertising showing strong growth. The negativity could likely be attributed to profit-taking and uncertainty surrounding CapEx levels.\nMETA\u2019s quarterly results are expected on July 31st after the close. The company\u2019s improved operational efficiencies have aided its profitability significantly, with EPS growing 80% throughout its latest quarter.\nThe sell-off following its latest print can be attributed to its announcement of higher CapEx for the current fiscal year, which was raised to a band of $35 - $40 billion (previously $30 - $37 billion). Meta raised its CapEx to accelerate its infrastructure investments for its artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap, also expecting higher CapEx for next year to support its efforts.\nInvestors will undoubtedly be looking for more color on CapEx trends surrounding AI, just like we saw in Alphabet\u2019s quarterly release. Earnings expectations for the release have ticked higher over recent months, with the $4.69 per share expected reflecting 45% Y/Y growth.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nConcerning key metrics, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Advertising revenue stands at $37.5 billion, 20% higher than the year-ago period. The company\u2019s Advertising results have consistently beaten our expectations recently, but the beats have gotten increasingly smaller, as shown below.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn addition, META shares aren\u2019t expensive heading into the release, with the current 21.2X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 37.0X. The current PEG ratio also works out to 1.1X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth.\nAlphabet\u2019s GOOGL quarterly release brought about some selling pressure, with comments surrounding AI CapEx causing some spooks. Meta Platforms META experienced the same post-earnings fate following its latest release for the same reason, but shares have since recovered.\nAll in all, it was a solid print from Alphabet, with all aspects of the business performing nicely. The favorable advertising results provide us with a decent read-through of what to expect from Meta Platforms concerning its advertising business, and investors should also expect scrutiny surrounding CapEx.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Yuvraj Malik ",
        "Text": "By Yuvraj Malik\n(Reuters) - Google-parent Alphabet is expected to report a nearly 14% rise in quarterly revenue, its fourth straight quarter of double-digit growth, driven by steady demand for its artificial intelligence-powered cloud computing services and an uptick in the ad market.\nThe search giant's second-quarter report on Tuesday, the first among the Big Technology companies this season, could offer further insight into the uptake of AI services, as well as the rising costs associated with the new technology.\nAt a developer conference in May, Google widely rolled out AI-powered summaries in Search and beefed up its Gemini AI model to better compete with services from OpenAI and Microsoft.\nGoogle is also launching new Pixel devices with AI capabilities next month, moving forward its unveiling event, typically set in fall, after Apple announced in June a slew of AI capabilities and an integration with ChatGPT in the latest iPhones.\n\"Investors will be looking for continued success in Search, but also for signs of the company adapting to the new world of AI,\" said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.\n\"The company will need to show that AI is driving Google Cloud growth, that there are no share losses in Search as users start leaning more on AI chat, and that the new models being built are competitive.\"\nAlphabet's AI investments will also be closely watched. In the January-March period, the company's capital expenditure jumped 91% to $12 billion, rattling some investors even though CEO Sundar Pichai assured that the AI integrations were boosting demand for its cloud and search businesses.\nThe company's operating expenses in the second quarter ended June likely rose more than 32% to $27.57 billion, according to LSEG data, the highest jump in over two years.\nInvestors will also have questions around reports that Alphabet is in talks to buy cybersecurity startup Wiz for roughly $23 billion and how that would affect its bottomline.\nAlphabet's core businesses are likely to report healthy growth as an improving macro-economic climate gives customers the confidence to invest in cloud computing and spend on advertising.\n\"Google search spending still held up fairly well ... we think advertisers need to spend as a key offset to inflation,\" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson.\nMedia investment firm GroupM raised its 2024 global advertising growth forecast to 7.8% in June, from 5.3% in December, primarily on account of better-than-expected spending in China and the United States.\nAnalysts also expect strong performance at YouTube, thanks in part to expanded monetization features in its TikTok-styled video offering, Shorts.\nAlphabet's second-quarter cloud computing sales and advertising revenue are expected to grow 26.4% and 10.8%, respectively, according to LSEG data, largely similar to the preceding two quarters.\nAd-dependent peer Meta Platforms will report its results next week on Wednesday, July 31.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik and Priyanka G in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Shinjini Ganguli)\n"

        "Text": "It's hard to imagine that brands like Android, YouTube, Google, and even Fitbit fall under the same company. Each is a subsidiary of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), making the company one of the most successful organizations in history. Its stock price hit a new all-time high last week, crossing $190 per share. Meanwhile, recent developments suggest that Alphabet still has plenty of room to run over the next decade and beyond.\nAlphabet has benefited from a rally across tech, which has seen its shares soar about 57% since last July. Wall Street has grown bullish about companies pushing the envelope in artificial intelligence (AI), with Alphabet one of the biggest names in the industry. The Google company has been an AI-first firm since 2016, innovating with its DeepMind AI research laboratory.\nAdditionally, Alphabet has a dominating position in digital advertising that is delivering significant financial growth.\nHere's why it's not too late to buy Alphabet stock -- it's actually a screaming buy right now.\nAlphabet has many products under its umbrella. These range from productivity software to a search engine, video sharing, a leading smartphone operating system, and much more. However, going purely by its earnings, the company is primarily a digital advertising firm. Alphabet has strategically used the massive popularity of its various platforms to become an advertising behemoth, responsible for a leading 24% of the market.\nIn fact, ads from its various services earned 87% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of 2024, up 14% from the previous year and totaling more than $70 billion. Despite many years in the industry, advertising remains a highly lucrative venture for Alphabet, as operating income from Google Service rose 28% year over year in Q1 2024.\nAlphabet's dominant position in advertising and its long list of potent brands have given it the financial resources to expand its business. The company has ramped up its AI efforts over the last year, expanding its library of generative tools on Google Cloud and launching its most advanced AI model ever, Gemini.\nDespite Alphabet's many years in the AI market, it's still early days for its journey into the space when considering its potential. The company has the opportunity to employ a similar strategy to what it did in advertising, using its popular services to promote its AI technology. In this way, Alphabet can bolster business by building Google into a true competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT, continuing to expand Google Cloud, adding generative features to its productivity platforms, and offering more efficient advertising.\nAlphabet has spent billions on AI over the last year, yet the company has continued to deliver significant financial gains. Recent growth illustrates the reliability of its business over the long term and its ability to keep up with its competitors in the coming years.\nIn Q1 2024, Alphabet's total revenue soared 15% year over year to $81 billion, beating analysts' forecasts by nearly $2 billion. However, the most impressive rise came in the form of operating income, which spiked 46% year over year to more than $25 billion. The increase came from considerable growth in Google Services profits. Meanwhile, Google Cloud delivered nearly five times the operating income from the previous year.\nThe chart above shows that Alphabet delivered impressive financial growth over the last five years. The company is on a promising growth trajectory that makes its stock just too good to pass up right now.\nAlphabet's 57% stock rise over the last year outperforms many of its peers, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. Yet, the chart below indicates that the Google company's stock still offers more value than any of these competitors.\nThe data above compares the valuations of some of the most prominent tech companies using their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. P/E is a helpful metric calculated by dividing a company's current stock price by its earnings per share. In this case, Alphabet's significantly lower P/E makes it one of the best bargains in \"Big Tech.\"\nWith its considerable financial growth and potential in AI, it's clearly not too late to invest in Alphabet and benefit from its development long into the future.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL shares have rallied 33.2% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 28.7%. The company is continuously benefiting from its growing generative AI capabilities to enhance user experience.Alphabet\u2019s division Google recently introduced a Gemini-powered summarize feature in Gmail for Android.This generative-AI-backed feature will be useful in summarizing long newsletters in Gmail. Users can also recap conversations in Gmail with the \u201cSummarize this email\u201d option.Alphabet is expected to gain solid traction among Android users using Google Workspace on the back of this new feature.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIn addition to the latest summarize feature, Google launched Gemma 2, a lightweight open model available in 9B and 27B parameter sizes, aiming to accelerate AI deployment and innovations across various enterprises.Alphabet rolled out its generative AI-powered note-taking app, NotebookLM, which was previously available only in the United States, to Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, the U.K., and 208 more countries and territories.NotebookLM, powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro language model, aids in document understanding and reasoning. It generates summaries and suggests follow-up questions, focusing on the content of the documents.Google also rolled out YouTube Music Gemini Extension, which enables users to search for music and play radio, among others, with the help of an AI chatbot experience.It also enhanced Android Studio's bot with Gemini Pro, allowing developers to ask coding-related questions and seamlessly integrate generative AI features into their apps.These efforts will enable Alphabet to capitalize on the solid growth opportunities present in the generative AI market, which, per a Statista report, is expected to hit $36.06 billion in 2024 and reach $356.10 by 2030, witnessing a CAGR of 46.5% between 2024 and 2030.Alphabet currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nGrowing generative AI capabilities boost Alphabet\u2019s competitive position against its peers like Microsoft MSFT, Adobe ADBE and Amazon AMZN, which are also making concerted efforts to strengthen their foothold in the generative AI space.GOOGL shares have outperformed MSFT and AMZN\u2019s return of 23% and 30%, respectively, in the year-to-date period. ADBE shares have lost 4.4% in the same time frame.Microsoft\u2019s move to enhance its generative AI capabilities by integrating GPT-4 into Bing and Edge, providing a ChatGPT-like user experience, remains noteworthy.Meanwhile, Adobe is riding on the success of its family of creative, generative AI models, Firefly. It recently integrated Firefly-powered Generative Fill, Remove Background, Erase and Crop features into Acrobat. These features are designed to allow customers to edit images directly in PDFs.Amazon, on the other hand, is benefiting from the solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock, which offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.\nAlphabet\u2019s strengthening generative AI capabilities, coupled with its strong competitive position, are acting as key drivers of its long-term growth prospects.Moreover, the company\u2019s robust cloud division, growing momentum across Google\u2019s mobile search, and increasing demand for its Android, Search and YouTube offerings are other positives.These factors are expected to continue driving the overall financial performance of the company in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $291.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.6%.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure.

        "Author": "  Marissa Newman and Davey Alba ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Google parent Alphabet Inc. is in talks to acquire cybersecurity startup Wiz Inc., according to a person familiar with the matter.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nCanada\u2019s Immigration Minister Has a Message for Foreign Students: You Can\u2019t All Stay\nBrookfield Lines Up a 36-Year-Old Rising Star as Next Billionaire CEO\nBiden Faces Intensified Calls to Step Aside While Ill With Covid\nWall Street\u2019s \u2018Great Rotation Trade\u2019 Takes a Break: Markets Wrap\nAltman\u2019s $3.7 Billion Fusion Startup Leaves Scientists Puzzled\nA deal may be worth as much as $23 billion, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information. That would make it the tech giant\u2019s largest acquisition to date. An agreement hasn\u2019t been reached and talks could still end without one, the person said.\nA representative for Alphabet didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Wiz declined to comment.\nAlphabet already owns the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, which it bought for $5.4 billion two years ago in its second-largest acquisition, topped only by its deal for Motorola Mobility Holdings LLC completed in 2012. An acquisition target as large as Wiz would be unusual for a big tech company like Alphabet and may draw even more scrutiny from antitrust regulators.\nGoogle already faces several antitrust challenges, including a lawsuit by the US Justice Department accusing it of abusing its dominant position in online search and another one regarding its digital advertising tools.\nThe Wiz talks, which were previously reported by the Wall Street Journal, come on the heels of Alphabet shelving efforts to acquire customer relationship management company HubSpot Inc., which Bloomberg News reported last week.\nGoogle shares, which have gained more than 33% this year, rose about 1% to $186.54 at 1 p.m. in New York.\nNew York-based Wiz connects to cloud storage providers such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure and scans data stored there for security risks. The company, founded in 2020, was valued at $12 billion during a May funding round that drew investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Thrive Capital.\nThe acquisition of Wiz could help Google catch up to Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. in an increasingly competitive cloud market.\nAlphabet has been ramping up investment in its cloud customer business, including offering more generative artificial intelligence tools for clients. Though Google still lags behind Microsoft and Amazon in the market for cloud computing, the company reported that its cloud unit has been profitable in consecutive quarters, after years of the unit being a money-losing operation.\nOpportunities are growing in the space as more startups move their apps and data to the cloud, particularly for generative AI purposes. Artificial intelligence tools are trained off of enormous data sets and often require vast amounts of compute power to generate content such as images, marketing campaigns or software code.\nAn Alphabet takeover of Wiz also stands to intensify Google\u2019s competition against Microsoft, the world\u2019s largest seller of cybersecurity products. Microsoft has been hit with a series of embarrassing hacks that have exposed corporate and government customers in recent years.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 11 Biggest AI and Tech Stock Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades in July So Far.\u00a0Since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nAs soon as the latest softer-than-expected inflation data numbers were out, investors began to take profits from major tech stocks and pour money into small-cap companies amid hopes of rate cuts. However, some were quick to call the latest decline in tech stocks the end of the AI-fueled rally that has pushed stock valuations to eye-popping levels. But there are some Wall Street analysts who believe this is just a short-term trend and large tech and AI stocks have a lot of room to grow. Samantha McLemore, CIO of Patient Capital, said while talking to CNBC that the \u201cbull market continues and the path of least resistance is higher.\u201d\nThe analyst said that she has been in the market for a long time and investors have been worrying about the end of the bull market since 2009, while the S&P 500 has grown over 1000% (17% per year) since then.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any end to the bull market. We do think there\u2019s a good chance we see a rotation and small caps, the laggards, do much better in the second half of the year as the Fed starts to cut rates.\u201d\nSome analysts believe the latest decline in tech stocks is yet another opportunity for long-term investors to pile into AI stocks for gains. In this backdrop, we decided to take a look at the top AI stock upgrades and downgrades this month. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nDeepwater\u2019s Gene Munster thinks that Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is going to win the \u201cAI arms race.\u201d While talking to CNBC, the analyst said that Google search business is \u201cintact, no need to worry.\u201d Munster\u2019s thesis is based on his in-depth testing of several large language models and chatbots including Google\u2019s Gemini. Munster also thinks other chatbots do not offer a strong imperative for users to switch from Google search as of yet.\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives in a fresh note named Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) as one of the stocks that can benefit from the AI boom.\nAccording to a latest UBS report, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls in all three layers of the AI value chain \u2013 enabling, intelligence and application layer. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an AI enabling player because of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform, while Gemini makes it a key player in the intelligence layer. On the application layer, UBS believes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has an edge with its Duet AI assistant and advertising. All these catalysts make Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) a company that could benefit from the $1.2 trillion AI opportunity by 2027, UBS said.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the company is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note-taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrated with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) app urges users to sign up for \u2018Google One AI Premium\u2019 plan, which has a $19.99 price tag. \u00a0Google saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\nClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cCommunication services gains in the S&P 500 were driven mainly by\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) (aka Google). The company has a dominant position in internet search and video advertising, and a solid cloud services business. Alphabet\u2019s initiation of a dividend in the quarter enabled us to take a small position. We see further meaningful revenue opportunities from AI innovations across its segments and may look to increase our holdings over time. Alphabet\u2019s exceptional balance sheet and improving cost efficiencies further solidify its strong position and growth prospects, and we expect its dividend will grow sharply over time.\nOverall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 11 Biggest AI and Tech Stock Analyst Upgrades and Downgrades in July So Far. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power.

        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) stock inched 2.5% higher through 1:10 p.m. ET Monday after getting a boost from investment bank Wedbush.\nPreviewing Alphabet's expected Q2 earnings report Tuesday, Wedbush reiterated its $205 price target and outperform rating on the stock, based on its belief that competition from rival artificial intelligence (AI) services has done little damage to Google's dominant internet search business.\nGrowth at Alphabet's all-important Google Search business should be as high as 12.8% in Q2, argues Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt in a note covered by The Fly today -- better than the 12% growth Wedbush previously postulated, and very close to the 12.9% revenue growth analysts are forecasting for Alphabet overall this quarter.\nFactor in all the other parts of the Google ecosystem, plus contributions from Google Cloud, Google's own artificial intelligence products, and \"other bets,\" and Devitt sees Google growing total revenue by 13.1% for the quarter -- which is actually more than most analysts are expecting.\nSo long story short, Devitt is predicting a sales beat for Alphabet -- and potentially an earnings beat as well.\nHow much will earnings need to grow to make Alphabet stock a buy, though? Valued on trailing earnings, Alphabet stock costs about 27 times earnings today. That's a bit pricey given consensus forecasts for 18% long-term earnings growth, but perhaps not unjustified seeing as Alphabet remains the dominant search provider -- and seems to remain dominant despite new competition from AI companies such as ChatGPT.\nWhat's a bit more worrisome is the company's free cash flow, which hasn't measured up well against reported net income since 2022, and in fact currently lags reported income by about 16% (i.e., for every $1 Alphabet reports as profit, it's actually only generating about $0.84 in real cash profit). Valued on these cash profits, Alphabet looks significantly more expensive at a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 32.\nDominant business or not, I personally would want to see Alphabet stock trading quite a bit cheaper before calling it a buy right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +9.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 8.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.61 indicates a change of +13.3% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $70.55 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $291.26 billion and $325.08 billion estimates indicate +13.6% and +11.6% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Alphabet division Google\u2019s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and especially generative AI have been major positives.In second-quarter 2024, the Google Cloud segment, which derives revenues from fees collected for Google Cloud Platform services and Google Workspace collaboration tools, generated revenues of $10.35 billion (12.2% of the total revenues), up 28.8% year over year.Beside these, Alphabet, known as the search giant, is constantly benefiting from solid search momentum, the growing popularity of Android and strength in YouTube.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet is riding on solid momentum in Google Cloud, which is enjoying growing customer momentum due to generative AI strength.Google is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models with its most powerful AI model called Gemini.The company offers an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool, Gemini Code Assist, which is driving its momentum among various enterprises.Solid momentum in Google\u2019s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is another positive. Google also added Anthropic\u2019s newly released model, called Claude 3.5 Sonnet, to Vertex AI. The launch of the latest image generation model, namely Imagen 3, in preview for Vertex AI customers with early access, is a plus.Google\u2019s introduction of various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure is a plus.The company recently made Gemma 2, which belongs to its family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models called Gemma, available to researchers and developers across the globe in both 9 billion (9B) and 27 billion (27B) parameter sizes.Google\u2019s unveiling of LearnLM, a family of generative AI models designed for conversational tutoring on various subjects, is noteworthy.\nStrengthening generative AI capabilities, along with Google Cloud\u2019s other robust cloud solutions, expanding data center network, and an increasing number of infrastructure regions, are constantly bolstering its customer base.Recently, Workday WDAY extended its partnership with Google Cloud to accelerate the integration of generative AI technology into its platform. Workday plans to leverage Google\u2019s Gemini models and Vertex AI in order to aid in quick AI-powered code generation, troubleshooting and information retrieval.Cintas partnered with Google Cloud to develop a generative AI-powered knowledge center to accelerate its digital transformation. Cintas is leveraging Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI in order to build its gen AI-backed search engines to empower employees.Victoria's Secret & Co. is in a multi-year strategic partnership with Google Cloud to enhance online shopping experiences globally and improve operational efficiency. Victoria\u2019s Secret is utilizing Google Cloud\u2019s AI and generative AI technologies to develop a novel conversational assistant that will provide personalized product recommendations. Powered by Vertex AI, the chatbot intends to deliver individualized advice based on unique preferences and experiences.An expanding customer base is expected to aid the performance of Google Cloud in the days ahead.For 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Cloud revenues is pegged at $41.93 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 26.7%.The growing prospects of Google Cloud place Alphabet well in the highly competitive cloud market.In the global cloud infrastructure market, Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider, reaching a record 10% market share in the first quarter of 2024, per Synergy Research Group. This narrows the gap with market leader Amazon\u2019s AMZN AWS and the second-largest player Microsoft\u2019s MSFT Azure, which accounted for 31% and 25% of the market, respectively. The \"Big Three\" control around 67% of the expanding cloud industry.\nIn this data-driven world, wherein cloud has become mainstream for most businesses, Alphabet\u2019s solid Google Cloud momentum due to compelling cloud solutions, expanding customer base and growing generative AI capabilities are expected to benefit its near and long-term prospects.The consensus mark for third-quarter 2024 revenues is pegged at $72.73 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 13.6%.

Over the last few years, the company has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly with more than 94% of the online search volume and market. Over the years, the company has witnessed increase in search queries, resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity, and improvements in ad formats.\nGOOGL boasts a Growth Style Score of B and VGM Score of B, and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating.

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): Are Hedge Funds Bullish on This Edge Computing Stock Now?",
        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Edge Computing Market Size and 7 Best Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other edge computing stocks.\nThe information technology sector has consistently outperformed investor and analyst expectations in 2023, and this trend appears to be continuing into the current year. This impressive performance can largely be attributed to significant advancements such as the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI, which have driven tech stock prices to unprecedented highs. Of course, AI is not the only area that is revolutionizing the technology space. Edge Computing comes in as another compelling area of growth and investment. Also known as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) or Multi-Access Edge Computing, Edge Computing focuses on bringing computing power closer to where data is generated, rather than relying on a centralized cloud-based system. In layman's terms, Edge Computing involves relocating part of the storage and computing capabilities from a central data center to locations near the data sources.\nBy keeping computational capacity close to users, devices, or data sources, edge solutions offer benefits such as reduced latency, increased bandwidth, local device processing, and data offloading. For instance, smart speakers perform minimal computational work, sending requests to servers owned by the provider. With Edge Computing, smart speakers could process a user\u2019s request entirely on the device itself. Gartner, in its March 2024 Market Guide for Edge Computing, states:\n\u201cBy placing data, data management capabilities and analytic workloads at optimal points, ranging all the way to endpoint devices, enterprises can enable more real-time use cases. In addition, the flexibility to move data management workloads up and down the continuum from centralized data centers or from the cloud-to-edge devices will enable greater optimization of resources.\u201d\nThe automotive industry is a prime example of rapid advancements driven by edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI) integration in recent years. As vehicles evolve to incorporate self-driving capabilities, these technologies have become essential for effective decision-making and real-time responses. For instance, Tesla leverages extensive real-world driving data to refine its AI algorithms for autonomous driving. The rollout of EV maker's Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to more drivers highlights its performance in real-world conditions, with the vast amount of visual data collected during these drives enhancing the company's AI learning process.\nFurthermore, the advent and adoption of 5G, the fifth generation of cellular network technologies offering substantially greater bandwidth, is accelerating the growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and facilitating the widespread adoption of edge computing. With 5G networks enabling lightning-fast speeds and a greater number of connected devices, data volumes are expected to surge. Predictions state that by 2025, every connected person will interact with digital data at least once every 18 seconds, largely due to the billions of IoT devices projected to generate over 90 zettabytes of data by then.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global edge computing market was valued at $15.96 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from $21.41 billion in 2024 to $216.76 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate of 33.6% over the forecast period. This growth is fueled by the increasing adoption of edge devices, ranging from IoT devices such as mobile point-of-sale kiosks and smart cameras to computational infrastructure that enables faster and real-time data analysis at the source. On the other hand, PwC projects that the global market for edge data centers will nearly triple, growing from $4 billion in 2017 to $13.5 billion this year. This expansion is driven by the potential of locally situated data centers to reduce latency, manage intermittent connections, and facilitate data storage and computation close to end-users.\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best edge computing stocks to buy now.\nOur Methodology\nFor our list of the best edge computing stocks, We began by sifting through ETFs' holdings and online rankings to gather a preliminary list of 15 stocks. We then scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s first-quarter database which tracks 920 elite money managers and selected the top seven that were the most widely held by hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 166\nIn the realm of edge computing, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) Edge component is a secure, high-performance device managed by Google Cloud and designed for edge locations. It provides local storage, machine learning inference, data transformation, and export capabilities. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) targets this component at enterprises in industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, healthcare, and automotive, which require low-latency and high-throughput solutions. The company ranks as one of the best edge computing stocks in this regard.\nInsider Monkey\u2019s first-quarter data shows that 165 hedge funds were bullish on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 166 in the previous quarter. The largest stakeholder is Ken Fisher\u2019s Fisher Asset Management, holding 46.3 million shares valued at $6.99 billion.\nOn April 25, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s chief executive Sundar Pichai announced that YouTube and Google's cloud business are expected to achieve a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion by the end of 2024, highlighting significant revenue sources for the search giant. YouTube alone reported $8.1 billion in ad sales for the first quarter ending March 31, marking its highest Q1 revenue to date, up 21% year-over-year from $6.7 billion in Q1 2023.\nAdditionally, Bank of America's industry checks in the search engine market recently revealed that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) remains the market leader with a dominant 95% share, while Bing's search holds just 0.7%.\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its \u00a02024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 \u2013 showing meaningful progress in the company\u2019s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company\u2019s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it\u2019s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.\u201d\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of the best edge computing stocks to buy. You can visit Edge Computing Market Size and 7 Best Stocks To Buy\u00a0to see the other edge computing stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 7 Best AI Value Stocks That are \u2018Money Machines\u2019 According to NYU\u2019s Aswath Damodaran.\u00a0Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nAswath Damodaran is a Professor of Finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University. His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the \u201cvalue stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.\u201d\n\u201cWe look at the last year and a half, they\u2019ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap\u2026 just these seven companies. Just to give you perspective, the second-largest market in the world, China, has a market cap of $12.1 trillion. These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.\u201d\nDamodaran\u2019s comments are important because he\u2019s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued. In September, he said on CNBC that if you go through the list of top tech stocks, \u201cyou are more likely to be overvalued than undervalued.\u201d\nBut in his latest interview, Damodaran said that before we \u201cdismiss\u201d Mag. 7 stocks as \u201crisky tech companies,\u201d we should keep in mind that \u201cthese are the money machines in this market.\u201d\nHowever, when asked whether he believes we are not in any kind of \u201cdanger zone,\u201d the professor said we are in the danger zone not just in terms of these seven stocks, but the market overall.\nIn this article we take a look at the Mag 7. stocks and their AI-related growth catalysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nAlphabet is a key part of the Mag. 7 group of stocks which Aswath Damodaran believes are money machine value stocks.\nAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0bulls believe the company is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrate with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0app is to urge users to sign up for \u2018Google One AI Premium\u2019 plan, which has a $19.99 price tag. \u00a0Google saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\nOakmark Global Select Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) was the top contributor during the quarter. The stock price rose after the U.S.-based communication services company reported first-quarter operating income growth of 31% versus the prior year. We believe management\u2019s cost reduction initiatives will improve operating efficiency and lead to faster earnings growth. In addition, we expect the company\u2019s new AI-powered features showcased at the recent Google I/O conference will increase the value of its products to users. At the current share price, we continue to see upside to our estimate of Alphabet\u2019s intrinsic value.\u201d\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0April 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 \u2013 showing meaningful progress in the company\u2019s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company\u2019s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it\u2019s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.\nThe CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has \u201cchanged.\u201d\n\u201cFrom what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.\u201d\nIn this program, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies\u2019 fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

But why did the stock go down?\nCramer said people are noticing that Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search business might be in trouble amid the rise of ChatGPT and other language models.\n\u201cPerhaps people think wait a second, I am using their AI platform as well as Microsoft\u2019s, so are their regular search numbers are going down. It\u2019s a legitimate question, I know I use search much less, I go to ChatGPT. Many other people are doing the same thing.

Munster also thinks other chatbots do not offer a strong imperative for users to switch from Google search as of yet.\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives in a fresh note named Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) as one of the stocks that can benefit from the AI boom.\nAccording to a latest UBS report, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls in all three layers of the AI value chain \u2013 enabling, intelligence and application layer. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an AI enabling player because of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform, while Gemini makes it a key player in the intelligence layer.

        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) stock is losing ground Wednesday. The tech giant's share price was down 3.4% as of 10:30 a.m. ET, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nAlphabet published second-quarter results after the market closed yesterday. Despite strong sales and earnings beats in the quarter, investors are selling out of the stock in response to the company's forward guidance.\nAlphabet posted earnings per share of $1.89 on revenue of $84.74 billion in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the average analyst estimate had called for the business to record per-share earnings of $1.85 on sales of $84.29 billion.\nEven though the company's share price is dipping today, the company's Q2 results were very strong -- and most key segments put up impressive performances. Overall revenue rose 15% year over year on a currency-adjusted basis, and the company's operating income margin hit 32% -- up from the 29% margin it posted in last year's quarter and exceeding the 31% margin predicted by Wall Street.\nAlphabet's \"Google search and other\" segment saw revenue increase roughly 14% year over year to hit $48.5 billion. The company's cloud business also delivered another quarter of strong growth, with revenue rising roughly 29% year over year to hit $10.35 billion. Along with strong sales momentum for most of its segments, efficiency initiatives at the company helped push diluted earnings per share up roughly 31% compared to last year's quarter.\nWhile Alphabet's Q2 results were roundly better than Wall Street had anticipated, company management made comments on the quarterly earnings call that have triggered an uptick in bearish sentiment. Third-quarter operating margins will likely be pressured due to increases in depreciation and expenses related to the company's investment in artificial intelligence (AI) and other tech infrastructure.\nWhile margins could see some uneven movement in the near term, the long-term trajectory points to continued margin expansion for the company. Alphabet still expects that this year's operating margins will be up on an annual basis, and the software leader is likely still in the very early stages of benefiting from the AI revolution.\nWith Alphabet now trading at roughly 23 times this year's expected earnings, shares look attractively valued given the company's sales and earnings momentum. If you're a long-term investor interested in building a position in the tech giant's stock, today's pullback appears to present a worthwhile buying opportunity.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai\nThank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. I'm really pleased with our results this quarter. They showed tremendous ongoing momentum in Search and great progress in Cloud with our AI initiatives driving new growth. Search had another excellent quarter. And in terms of product innovation, we are seeing great progress with AI Overviews. In Q2, cloud reached some major milestones. Quarterly revenues crossed the $10 billion mark for the first time at the same time passed the $1 billion mark in quarterly operating profit.Year-to-date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers. As I spoke about last quarter, we are uniquely well positioned for the AI opportunity ahead. Our research and infrastructure leadership means we can pursue an in-house strategy that enables our product teams to move quickly. Combined with our model building expertise, we are in a strong position to control our destiny as the technology continues to evolve.Importantly, we are innovating at every layer of the AI stack from chips to agents and beyond, a huge strength. We are committed to this leadership long term. This was underscored by the announcements we made at I/O, Cloud Next and Google Marketing Live, and we'll touch on many of them here. Today, I'll start with Search, then move to our AI momentum more generally followed by cloud, YouTube and some closing thoughts.Let's dive in. Over the past 25 years, we have continued to reimagine and expand Google Search across many technological shifts. With AI, we are delivering better responses on more types of search queries and introducing new ways to search. We are pleased to see the positive trends from our testing continue as we roll out AI Overviews, including increases in search usage and increased user satisfaction with the results.People who are looking for help with complex topics are engaging more and keep coming back for AI Overviews. And we see even higher engagement from younger users aged 18 to 24 when they use Search with AI Overviews. As we have said, we are continuing to prioritize approaches that send traffic to sites across the web and we are seeing that ads appearing either above or below AI Overviews continue to provide valuable options for people to take action and connect with businesses.Beyond AI Overviews, AI expands the types of queries we are able to address and opens up powerful new ways to search. Visual search via Lens is one. Soon, you'll be able to ask questions by taking a video with Lens. And already we've seen that AI Overviews and Lens leads to an overall visual search usage.Another example is Circle to Search, which is available today on more than 100 million Android devices. We are seeing tremendous momentum from our AI investments. More than 1.5 million developers are now using Gemini across our developer tools, and we recently unveiled new models that are more capable and efficient than ever.Gemini now comes in four sizes with each model designed for its own set of use cases. It's a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything from data centers to devices. At 2 million tokens, we offer the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to date, which powers developer use cases that no other model can handle. Gemini is making Google's own products better. All six of our products with more than 2 billion monthly users now use Gemini. This means that Google is the company that's truly bringing AI to everyone. Gemini is powering incredibly helpful features in Search, Workspace, Google Messages and more.At our I/O, we showed new features coming soon to Gmail and to Google Photos. Soon, you'll be able to ask for those questions like what did I eat at that restaurant in Paris last year. For a glimpse of the future, I hope you saw project Astra at I/O. It shows multimodal understanding and natural conversational capabilities. We have always wanted to build a universal agent, and it's an early look at how they can be helpful in daily life.Our AI product advances come from our long standing foundation of research leadership as well as our global network of infrastructure. In Q2, we announced our first data center and cloud region in Malaysia and expansion projects in Iowa, Virginia and Ohio. Our TPUs are a key bet here too. Trillium is the sixth generation of our custom AI accelerator, and it's our best performing and most energy efficient TPU today.It achieves a near 5x increase in peak compute performance per chip and a 67% more energy efficient compared to TPU v5e. And the latest NVIDIA Blackwell platform will be coming to Google Cloud in early 2025. We continue to invest in designing and building robust and efficient infrastructure to support our efforts in AI, given the many opportunities we see ahead.Of course, as we do this, we'll continue create capacity by allocating resources towards our highest priorities. We are relentlessly driving efficiencies in our AI models. For example, over the past quarter, we have made quality improvements that include doubling the core model size for AI Overviews, while at the same time improving latency and keeping cost per AI Overview sell flat. And we are focused on matching the right model size to the complexity of the query in order to minimize impact on costs and latency. Separately on our real estate investments, we are taking a measured approach to match the current and future needs of our hybrid workforce as well as our communities.Next, Google Cloud. We continue to see strong customer interest, winning leading brands like Hitachi, Motorola Mobility and KPMG. Our deep partnership with Oracle significantly expanded our joint offerings to their large customer base. Our momentum begins with our AI infrastructure, which provides AI startups like Essential AI with leading cost performance for models and high-performance computing applications. We continue to drive fundamental differentiation with new advances since Cloud Next. This includes Trillium, which I mentioned earlier, and A3 Mega powered by NVIDIA H1100 GPUs, which doubles the networking bandwidth of A3.Our enterprise AI platform, Vertex, helps customers such as Deutsche Bank, Kingfisher, and the US Air Force build powerful AI agents. Last month, we announced a number of new advances. Uber and WPP are using Gemini Pro 1.5 and Gemini Flash 1.5 in areas like customer experience and marketing.We broadened support for third-party models, including Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Open Source models like Gemma 2, Llama and Mistral. We are the only cloud provider to offer grounding with Google search, and we are expanding grounding capabilities with Moody's, MSCI, ZoomInfo and more. Our AI powered applications portfolio is helping us win new customers and drive upsell.For example, our conversational AI platform is helping customers like Best Buy and Gordon Food Service. Gemini for Workspace helps Click Therapeutics analyze patient feedback as they build targeted digital treatments. Our AI-powered agents are also helping customers develop better quality software, fine insights from their data and protect their organization against cybersecurity threats using Gemini.Software engineers at Wipro are using Gemini Code Assist to develop and document software faster. And data analysts at Mercado Libre are using BigQuery and Looker to optimize capacity planning and fulfill shipments faster.Cyber security risks continue to accelerate, and the number of breaches continue to grow. Something we all see in the news every day and that our Mandiant teams help manage. Our strong track record of uptime, quality control and reliability make Google Cloud the trusted security choice for organizations like Fiserv and Marriott International. In Q2, we infused AI throughout our security portfolio, helping TELUS strengthened its proactive security posture.Turning next to YouTube. YouTube is focused on a clear strategy, connecting creators with a massive audience and enabling them to build successful businesses through ads and subscriptions while helping advertisers reach their desired audience. We had a great Brandcast this quarter and Philipp will say more. I'm pleased with the progress there. YouTube has remained number one in US streaming watch time according to Nielsen. Views of YouTube Shorts and Connected TVs more than doubled last year, and we are making it easier for creators to add captions and turn regular videos into Shorts.Next on Android and Pixel. We joined Samsung for their Galaxy Unpacked event a few weeks ago, and we shared that Samsung's new devices will include the latest AI-powered Google updates on Android. It was a great event. I'm looking forward to our Made by Google event happening in August. We'll have lots to share around Android and the Pixel portfolio of devices. Our pixel line is doing well. We recently introduced a new Pixel 8a powered by our latest Google Tensor G3 chip. It provides beautiful AI experiences like Circle to Search, Best Take and a Gemini-powered AI assistant.In Other Bets, I'm really pleased with the progress Waymo's making. A real leader in the space and getting rave reviews from users. Waymo served more than 2 million trips to date and driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles on public roads. Waymo's now delivering well over 50,000 weekly paid public rides primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix. And in June, we removed the waitlist in San Francisco so anyone can take a ride. Fully autonomous testing is underway in other Bay Area locations without a human in the driver's seat.Before I close, I want to acknowledge that today is Ruth's final earnings call. Let me take a moment to thank her for all she has done for Google and Alphabet as our longest-serving CFO. I'm excited to continue to work with her in her new role. And I look forward to welcoming our newly appointed CFO, Anat Ashkenazi. She starts next week, and you'll hear from her on our call next quarter. Thanks, as always, to our employees and partners everywhere for a great Q2.With that, over to you, Philip.\nPhilipp Schindler\nThanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. Starting with performance, Google Services delivered revenues of $73.9 billion for the quarter, up 12% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 40% year-on-year, led by growth in the retail vertical followed by financial services. YouTube ads revenues were up 13% year-on-year driven by growth in brand as well as direct response. Network revenues declined 5% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 14%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. For the rest of my remarks, I want to double-click on two topics: first, how we are applying AI across the marketing process to deliver an even stronger ads experience; second, YouTube's position as the leading multi-format platform.So let me start by sharing some of the ways we're applying AI to bring more performance benefits to even more businesses. Q2 brought several major opportunities to meet and learn from users, developers, creators and customers. From I/O to Brandcast, Google Marketing Live and Cannes, a growing number of our customers and partners are looking to understand how to successfully incorporate AI into their businesses.This quarter, we announced over 30 new ads features and products to help advertisers leverage AI and keep pace with the evolving expectations of customers and users. Across Search, PMX, demand gen and retail, we are plying AI to streamline workflows, enhance creative asset production and provide more engaging experiences for consumers.Listening to our customers, retailers, in particular, have welcomed AI-powered features to help scale the depth and breadth of their assets. For example, as part of the new and easier to use Merchant Center, we've expanded product studio with tools that bring the power of Google AI to every business owner. You can upload a product image from the AI with something like feature this product with Paris skyline in the background and product studio will generate campaign ready assets.I also hear great feedback from our customers on many of our other new AI-powered features. We're beta testing virtual try-on and shopping ads and plan to roll it on YT later this year. Feedback shows this feature gets 60% more high-quality use than other images and a higher click out to retailer sites. Retailers love it because it drives purchasing decisions and fewer returns. Our AI-driven profit optimization tools have been expanded to Performance Max and standard shopping campaigns. Advertisers use profit optimization and smart bidding, see a 15% uplift in profit on average compared to revenue-only bidding.Lastly, demand gen is rolling out to display Video 360 and Search Ads 360 in the coming months. With new generative image tools that create stunning, high-quality image assets for social marketers. As we said at GML, when paired with Search or PMX, demand gen delivers an average of 14% more conversions. The use cases we're seeing across the industry show the incredible potential of these AI-enabled products to improve performance.Let me briefly share two examples with you. Luxury jewelry retailer, Tiffany, leveraged demand gen during the holiday season and saw a 2.5% brand lift in consideration and actions such as adding items to carts and booking appointments. The campaign drove a 5.6 times more efficient cost per click compared to social media benchmarks. Our own Google marketing team used demand gen to create nearly 4,500 ad variations for Pixel 8 campaign shown across YouTube, Discover and Gmail, delivering twice the clicks per rate at nearly a quarter of the cost.In addition to strengthening our ads products for customers, we continue to evolve our existing systems and products with improved models delivering further performance gains. In just six months, AI-driven improvements to quality, relevance and language understanding have improved broad match's performance by 10% for advertisers using smart bidding.Also, advertisers who adopt P Max to Broad Match and Smart Bidding in their search campaigns, see an average increase of over 25% more conversions or value at a similar cost. We'll continue to listen to our customers and use their feedback to drive innovation across our products. As you can hear, I continue to be excited about the AI era for ads.Now let's turn to YouTube. I've talked before about our approach to making YouTube the best place to create, watch and monetize. First, the best place to create. What sets YouTube apart from every other platform are the creators and the connection they have with their fans. Audience is tuning in to watch their favorite creators continue to grow. For example, two weeks ago, Mr. Beast's Channel hit more than 300 million subscribers.Next, the best place to watch. Our long-term investment in CTV continues to deliver. Views on CTV have increased more than 130% in the last three years. According to Nielsen, YouTube is the number one most watched streaming platform on TV screens in the US for the 17th consecutive month. Zooming out when you look not just at streaming, but at all media companies and their combined TV viewership, YouTube is the second most watched after Disney. And this growth is happening in multiple verticals, including sports, which has seen CTV watch time on YouTube grow 30% year-over-year.Lastly, the best place to monetize. CTV on YouTube is continuing to benefit from a combination of strong watch time growth, viewer and advertiser innovation and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Our largest advertisers across verticals, including retail, entertainment, telco and home and personal care are partnering with creators on ads and organic integrations. Verizon, for example, worked with a YouTube creator and Verizon customer to show the many ways that plans and offerings can be customized to fit people's lives.Using AI-powered formats, they created sketches in multiple lengths and orientations to serve the right creative to the right viewer and drive people to their site. Verizon's creator ads had a 15% lower CPA and a 38% higher conversion rate versus other ads.Turning to Shorts. Last quarter, I shared that in the US, the monetization rate of YouTube Shorts relative to in-stream viewing is showing a healthy rate of growth. Again, this quarter, we continue to see an improvement in Shorts monetization, particularly in the US. We're also seeing a very encouraging contribution from brand advertising on Shorts, which we launched on the product in Q4 last year.Lastly, a few words on shopping. Last year, viewers watched 30 billion hours of shopping-related videos, and we saw a 25% increase in watch time for videos that help people shop. While it's early days, shopping remains a key area of investment. At GML, we rolled out several product updates to YouTube shopping, helping creators sell products to their viewers. These updates included product tagging where creators can tag products in their videos for viewers to discover and purchase, product collections and a new affiliate hub, a one-stop shop for creators to find deals and promotional offers from brands and track their affiliate earnings.With that, I'll finish by saying a huge thank you to Googlers everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. And Ruth, thanks for your amazing leadership and partnership over all these years.Now for one last time, it's over to you.\nRuth Porat\nThank you, Philipp, and thanks, Sundar, for those kind words. We had another strong quarter, driven in particular by performance in Search and Cloud as well as the ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook.For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $84.7 billion, up 14% or up 15% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $35.5 billion, up 11%. Other cost of revenues was $22.1 billion, up 14%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs, followed by depreciation as well as the impact of the Canadian digital services tax, which was applied retroactively.Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, up 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D partially offset by a decline in G&A with sales and marketing essentially flat to the second quarter last year. The increase in R&D was driven primarily by compensation, which was affected by lapping a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities in certain other bets in the second quarter last year followed by depreciation. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. Operating income was $27.4 billion, up 26% and our operating margin was 32%. Net income was $23.6 billion and EPS was $1.89.We delivered free cash flow of $13.5 billion in the second quarter and $60.8 billion for the trailing 12 months. As a reminder, last year, we had a timing benefit in the second and third quarters from a $10.5 billion deferred cash tax payment made in the fourth quarter, which depressed reported free cash flow growth this quarter, and will do so again next quarter. We ended the quarter with $101 billion in cash and marketable securities.Turning to segment results. Within Google services, revenues were $73.9 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48.5 billion in the quarter were up 14%, led again by growth in retail, followed by the financial services vertical. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.7 billion were up 13%, driven by brand followed by direct response advertising.Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 5%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues were $9.3 billion, up 14%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $13.4 billion, up 7%. Google Services operating income was $29.7 billion, up 27% and the operating margin was 40%.Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $10.3 billion for the quarter, up 29%, reflecting first significant growth in GCP, which was above growth for cloud overall and includes an increasing contribution from AI; and second, strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $1.2 billion and an operating margin of 11%. As to our Other Bets for the second quarter, revenues were $365 million and the operating loss was $1.1 billion.Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google services, first, within advertising. The strong performance of search was broad-based across verticals. In YouTube, we are pleased with the growth in the quarter. We had healthy watch time growth, continued to close the monetization gap in Shorts and had continued momentum in Connected TV with brand benefiting in part from an ongoing shift in budgets from linear television to digital. As we look forward to the third quarter, we will be lapping the increasing strength in advertising revenues in the second half of 2023 in part from APAC-based retailers.Turning to subscriptions, platforms and devices. First, we continue to have significant growth in our subscriptions business which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. However, there was a sequential decline in the year-on-year growth rate as we anniversaried the impact of a price increase for YouTube TV in the second quarter last year. The impact will persist through the balance of the year.Second, with regard to platforms. We are pleased with the performance in play driven by an increase in buyers. Finally, with respect to devices. The most important point as we look forward is that our Made by Google launches have been pulled forward into the third quarter from the fourth quarter last year, benefiting revenues in Q3 this year.Turning to Cloud, which continued to deliver very strong results. For the first time, Cloud crossed $10 billion in quarterly revenues and $1 billion in quarterly operating profit. As Sundar noted, year-to-date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers. We're particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our generative AI solutions. We continue to invest aggressively in the business.Turning to margins. The margin expansion in Q2 versus last year reflects our ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base as well as revenue strength. Our leadership team remains focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. Once again, headcount declined quarter-on-quarter, which reflects both actions we have taken in the first half of the year and a much slower pace of hiring.Looking ahead, we expect a slight increase in headcount in the third quarter as we bring on new graduates. As we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in cloud and technical infrastructure. Looking forward, we continue to expect to deliver full year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023.However, in the third quarter, operating margins will reflect the impact of both the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure as well as the increase in cost of revenues due to the pull forward of hardware launches into Q3.With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the second quarter was $13 billion, once again, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. Looking ahead, we continue to expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 CapEx of $12 billion, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx.With regard to Other Bets, we continue to focus on improving overall efficiencies as we invest for long-term returns. Waymo is an important example of this with its technical leadership coupled with progress on operational performance. As you will see in the 10-Q, we have chosen to commit to a new multiyear investment of $5 billion. This new round of funding, which is consistent with recent annual investment levels will enable Waymo to continue to build the world's leading autonomous driving technology company.To close, this is my 56th and last earnings call, 37 of them at Alphabet. So I have a few closing thoughts of gratitude. I've been so proud to be at Google and Alphabet as CFO and to work with some of the smartest people in the world every day. I think we have accomplished a lot in the last nine-plus years, and I am confident that progress will continue.Of course, I'm not going far and I'm honored to have my new role, which I've been slowly working my way into during the past 11 months and I look forward to continuing to work with Sundar, and our great team. Being CFO of one of the most important companies in the world has been the opportunity and responsibility of a lifetime. Google's mission of advancing technology and bringing information to people throughout the world is as relevant today as it was when I worked on its IPO.Technology has been a catalyst for economic growth throughout human history. The people on this call know that if technological advancement is not the focus of every business and government, it will be left behind. Underpinning this is the need for sound and responsible investment. That has never been more important than today and certainly, that is Google and Alphabet's focus.I want to end by thanking Googlers around the world for the innovation and commitment that has enabled us to deliver such extraordinary products and services globally. I also want to thank our investors and analysts for your long-term support and your feedback. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Brian Nowak, Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak\nFirst, thank you, Ruth, for all the help and significant impact over the past decade. The first one, it's a little bit of a jump, I guess, for Sundar, Philipp or Ruth. I guess we're sort of 18 months this fever pitch around Gen AI focus in the world. Maybe from any of your perspective, can you just sort of talk to us about areas where you've seen faster-than-expected traction or testing adoption of some of the AI, generative AI capabilities versus slower-than-expected traction and testing from a Google perspective? And then, Ruth, I appreciate all the comments about structurally reengineering the OpEx base. Are there any more tangible examples of areas you can talk to us about where you still see further ways to drive more efficiency across the company?\nSundar Pichai\nBrian, I'll take the first part. I think it's a good question. Obviously, I think there is a time curve in terms of taking the underlying technology and translating it into meaningful solutions across the board, both on the consumer and the enterprise side. Definitely, on the consumer side, I'm pleased, as I said in my comments earlier, in terms of how for a product like Search, which is used at that scale over many decades, how we've been able to introduce it in a way that it's additive and enhances to -- enhances overall experience and this -- positively contributing there. I think across our consumer products, we've been able -- I think we are seeing progress on the organic side.Obviously, monetization is something that we would have to earn on top of it. The enterprise side, I think we are at a stage where definitely there are a lot of models. I think roughly, the models are all kind of converging towards sort of base capabilities, but I think where the next wave is working to build solutions on top of it. And I think there are pockets, be it coding, be it in customer service, et cetera, where we are seeing some of those use cases seeing traction, but I still think there is hard work there to completely unlock those.\nRuth Porat\nAnd on your second question first, thank you for your comments. Look, the reason we've consistently used the term, the phrase that we're focused on durably reengineering our cost base is because these are deep work streams. They're not tactical fixes, and we continue to build on them. And so the main areas that we've talked about are around product and process prioritization around organizational efficiency and structure.Both of those are reflected in the headcount and the fact that headcount is down year-on-year. And across all of those -- as I said, across our entire leadership team, we remain focused on continuing to execute against them.So in terms of the most recent examples, as we talked about last quarter with the combination of the devices and services product area with the platforms and ecosystems product area, we announced that back in April. And what we discussed last quarter and what we're seeing is that unifying teams across these organizations helps with product execution and what we're really focused on is really adding to velocity and efficiency. So kind of the gift that keeps giving.And then more broadly, all of the work streams that we've talked to you about before, we continue to remain focused on. A big one, very important one, is all of the efficiency efforts, the work streams around technical infrastructure and improving efficiency there. We're also working on the use of AI across Alphabet. We're working on continuing to build on what we've done with our centralized procurement organization. We're continuing to optimize our real estate portfolio. And so again, this is across our leadership team. These are efforts that all build to this phrase, durably reengineering our cost base.\nOperator\nDoug Anmuth, JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth\nOne for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, you've now had Google Services operating margins roughly 40% for the past two quarters. Just as you create more capacity to help offset the future investments, is it reasonable to think that you could sustain at those kind of levels going forward?And then, Sundar, just as it relates to AI Overviews, you talked about the positive trends there. Can you just help us understand where you are, how far along in rolling out AI Overviews and then any more color around kind of click-through rates and monetization levels relative to your traditional searches?\nRuth Porat\nSo in terms of the Google services operating margin, it did reflect all the work that we're doing on durably reengineering the cost base. It also reflected the benefit of strong revenue performance in Search. And so what I tried to lay out in the comments, as we look forward to the third quarter is operating margins will reflect the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with higher levels of our investment in technical infrastructure.It will also reflect higher expenses associated with the Pixel launch due to the pull forward. So those are important factors. I would say, overall, company-wide, it's important to note that we do expect to continue to deliver full year '24 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023, but I did want to highlight those important points as we look forward to Q3.\nSundar Pichai\nAnd Doug, thanks on the AI overview, we are -- we have rolled it out in the US and we are -- will be through the course of the year, definitely scaling it up, both to more countries and also we have taken a conservative start focused on quality, making sure the metrics are healthy and so on. But you will see us expand the use cases around it, and we'll touch definitely more queries. All the feedbacks we have seen are positive. And on the monetization side, I think Philipp has touched upon it. Maybe Philipp, anything more you want to add there?\nPhilipp Schindler\nYeah. Yeah, look, innovation and improvements to the user experience on Search have historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We talked about this before we saw this when we navigated from desktop to mobile, for example. And we can see Gen AI obviously expand the types of questions we can help people with, as Sundar mentioned. And as we said before, people are finding ads, either above or below AI Overviews, helpful.We have a solid baseline here from which we can innovate and as you have probably noticed at GML, we announced that soon we'll actually start testing search and shopping ads in AI Overviews for users in the US and they will have the opportunity to actually appear within the AI Overview in a section clearly labeled as Sponsored when they're relevant to both the query and the information in the AI Overview, really giving us the ability to innovate here and take this to the next level.\nOperator\nMichael Nathanson, Moffett.\nMichael Nathanson\nI have two, one for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, on decision this week to not deprecate cookies. I know it's been a long journey, can you talk a bit about what we should expect in terms of new experience in Chrome and why the company makes a decision not to go down the path on deprecating cookies?And then Philipp, I know it's only one quarter, but it's interesting that Search is growing faster than YouTube, which surprised some of us. But can you talk about what factors you think are behind the difference in growth rates between these markets? And is there anything on the AI front that you could see maybe reaccelerating YouTube growth as you've seen happen with Search?\nSundar Pichai\nAnd Michael, on cookies, look, I think, obviously, we are super committed to improving privacy for users in Chrome and that was the whole focus around privacy. Sandbox and we remind, committed on the journey, but on third-party cookies, given the implications across the ecosystems and considerations and feedback across so many stakeholders, we now believe user choice is the best path forward there. And we'll both improve privacy by giving users choice and we'll continue our investments in privacy-enhancing technologies, but it's obviously an area we will be taking feedback from the players in the ecosystem, and we are committed to being privacy first as well.\nPhilipp Schindler\nAnd on the second part of your question, maybe, Ruth, you want to jump in first and then I take the rest, if needed.\nRuth Porat\nAbsolutely. So look, as we both noted, Search revenues really reflected broad-based growth across verticals. That was led by retail followed by financial services. I think your question really goes to the heart of the year-on-year growth comparison. And as both Philipp and I noted, we're really pleased with YouTube, the YouTube team, all that was done, it was driven by brand followed by direct response, and they have very strong ongoing operating metrics, which Philipp will comment on.I think the important point to note, and I tried to tease out in opening comments, was that the deceleration in this year-on-year revenue growth for the second quarter versus the first quarter, primarily reflected the tougher comparison versus the first quarter because at that point, as you probably recall, YouTube was lapping negative year-on-year growth in Q1 last year.And then also Q1 benefited from the extra day from leap year. And so what you're also seeing here is with YouTube, we were anniversarying the ramp in APAC-based retailers that began in the second quarter last year and foreign exchange headwinds as well that we noted. And so it's -- there are some timing issues going on and what we're trying to highlight is the underlying operating strength. Back to you, Philipp.\nPhilipp Schindler\nYeah, that was very comprehensive. Nothing really to add from my side here.\nSundar Pichai\nThe only thing I would say, I think, to Brian's first question on areas where things are maybe taking longer. I think, look, we are all building multimodal models. At least Gemini has been natively multimodal from the ground up. But most of the use cases today is -- that have been unlocked have been around the tech side. So in terms of getting real generative audio, video experience is working well, I think there is still -- it's going to take some time. But over time, obviously, it will be deeply relevant to YouTube and so it's an area I'm excited about in the future.\nOperator\nEric Sheridan, Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan\nAnd I'll echo the thanks for Ruth for all the insights and partnership over the years on these earnings calls. Sundar, maybe first for you, in terms of Cloud and bringing AI to the enterprise, I wanted to know if you go a little bit deeper in terms of how you're seeing AI actually get adopted, implemented, what it potentially could mean for the strategic positioning of the Cloud business and the potential for AI workloads to be a stimulant to revenue growth for Cloud First?And then following up the last set of questions on YouTube or really about the macro or the ad environment, what do you guys, as a team, continue to learn about the subscription side of YouTube and the appetite for consumers to engage with a broader array of media products at the subscription layer?\nSundar Pichai\nLook, on the Cloud and AI stuff, obviously, it's something which I think will end up being a big driver over time. I mentioned in my opening remarks already if you take a look at our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud, across everything we do be it compute on the AI side, the products we have through Vertex AI, Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud, et cetera, we definitely are seeing traction. People are deeply engaging with Gemini models. Across Vertex and AI studio, we now have over 2 million developers playing around with these things. And you are definitely seeing early use cases.But I think we are in this phase where we have to deeply work and make sure on these use cases, on these workflows, we are driving deeper progress on unlocking value, which I'm very bullish will happen. But these things take time. So -- but if I were to take a longer-term outlook, I definitely see a big opportunity here. And I think particularly for us, given the extent to which we are investing in AI, our research infrastructure leadership, all of that translates directly. And so I'm pretty excited about the opportunity space ahead.\nRuth Porat\nAnd then on your second question with respect to subscriptions, I am [impressed] in your question, how strong is it. As I noted in opening comments that overall line subscriptions platforms and devices delivered healthy growth and that was led by subscriptions. And as we've said on many calls here in a row, the subscription revenue growth continued to be quite strong. It was driven by subscriber growth in both YouTube TV and YouTube Music premium.And then the other component within that line is Google One that also delivered strong subscriber and revenue growth. But I think the heart of your question is really around YouTube and that is the heart of the revenues in that line. So it continues to be very strong. We see a lot of take up in it, strong subscriber growth, really pleased with it. We did note that growth on that line decelerated due to anniversarying this YouTube TV price increase. But at the heart of it, our people interested in the subscription offerings and is to take up significant, we're really pleased with it.\nOperator\nRoss Sandler, Barclays.\nRoss Sandler\nJust two questions on the AI CapEx. So it looks like from the outside at least, the hyperscaler industry is going from kind of an under bill situation this time last year to better meeting the demand with capacity right now to potentially being overbuilt next year if these CapEx growth rates keep up. So do you think that's a fair characterization? And how are we thinking about the return on invested capital with this AI CapEx cycle. And then related to that, do you think that the AI industry is close to or far away from hitting some kind of wall on foundation model improvement in AI training based on like lack of availability of new data to train on? Just your thoughts on that would be great.\nSundar Pichai\nI think great questions. Look, I -- obviously, we are at a early stage of what I view as a very transformative area and in technology when you're going through these transitions, aggressively investing upfront in a defining category, particularly in an area in -- which in a leveraged way cuts across all our core areas or products, including Search, YouTube and other services as well as fuels growth in Cloud and supports the innovative long-term bets and Other Bets. It's definitely something for us makes sense to lean in.I think the one way I think about it is when we go through a curve like this, the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here, even in scenarios where, if it turns out that we are over-investing, we clearly -- these are infrastructure which are widely useful for us. They have long useful lives and we can apply it across, and we can work through that.But I think not investing to be at the front here, I think, definitely has much more significant downsides. Having said that, we obsess around every dollar we put in. Our teams are -- work super hard, and I'm proud of the efficiency work, be it optimization of hardware, software, model deployment across our fleet. All of that is something we spend a lot of time on, and that's how we think about it.To your second question on whether -- how do the scaling loss hold? Are we hitting on some kind of wall or something? Look, I think we are all pushing very hard, and there's going to be a few efforts which will scale up on the compute side and push the boundaries of these models. What I would tell is regardless of how that plays out, I still think there is enough optimizations we are all doing which is driving constant progress in terms of the capabilities of the models. And more importantly, taking them and translating into real use cases across the consumer and enterprise side, I think on that frontier, I think there's still a lot of progress to be had. And so we are pretty focused on that as well.\nOperator\nStephen Ju, UBS.\nStephen Ju\nOkay. So Sundar, I guess, to ask the AI question a different way. As we talk to some of the model builders out there, it looks like the initial use cases are more on the cost savings or efficiency side. But when do we -- when do you think we'll start thinking about products that can help revenue generation for the Fortune 500, Fortune 1,000 companies, which is probably something that can hopefully create greater value over time versus just cutting costs?And Philipp, listening to what will be, I guess, Ruth's final comments on Q2 on these public calls. And thank you, by the way, Ruth, for all the help. I couldn't help but notice that the bigger factors were brand followed by direct response. And if we continue to think that the one you bring up first is the larger factor and tying this into your prior commentary about shopping being an important consideration, when do you think we'll start talking about direct response being a much bigger contributor to YouTube's growth versus brand?\nSundar Pichai\nOn the first part of the question, look, I think the technology's horizontal enough, it can apply on both sides. If you take a use case like improving the customer service experience, it is part of it, which is driving efficiencies, and you can look at it from a cost standpoint. But you could also be overall improving the experience, improving conversion, driving the funnel better and so increasing basket size if you're a retail e-commerce player, et cetera. So we are seeing people experiment across both sides. And so I think you will see it played across both sides.Philipp, on the second one?\nPhilipp Schindler\nYeah. On the second one, look, on the direct response side, as you know, it's about driving and converting commercial intent and customers are obviously benefiting from including video in their AI-powered campaigns, it could be P Max, it could be demand gen and obviously using our automated tools to enhance and create video creatives. And we're very, very optimistic about this path. On average, advertisers who run both image and video ads with demand gen campaigns see 6% more conversions per dollar than those running image only ads and discovery. And this is just one little example of how this can obviously boost your performance business. So that's a big part.The brand side, as you know, Google AI continues to make it easier for brands to show up next to the content where viewers are obviously, the most engaged, and they're finding it, as you can see from the numbers, a very effective way to drive awareness and consideration. And we're also quite excited about some of the recent launches on the YouTube shopping side, if you want to put that into the direct response bucket.\nOperator\nJustin Post, Bank of America.\nJustin Post\nGreat. I'll ask a couple of areas. First, on the cloud acceleration, would you characterize that as new AI demand helping drive that year-to-date? Or is that more of a rebound in just general compute and other demand or is AI really moving this forward and helping drive acceleration? And then I wanted to ask about your internal cost savings, which has been really strong. How are you using AI internally to help cut costs? Are you seeing better efficiencies with your engineers? And just would love to hear about how you're applying AI to cut your own costs?\nRuth Porat\nGreat. Thank you for that. So overall, we're -- as both Sundar and I said, we're very pleased with the results in Cloud. And there is clearly a benefit as the Cloud team is engaging broadly with customers around the globe with AI-related solutions, AI infrastructure solutions and the generative AI solutions. I think we noted that we're particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our generative AI solution.So it is clearly adding to strength of the business on top of all that they're doing. And just to be really clear, the results for GCP, the growth rate for GCP is above the growth for cloud overall. And then I'll turn it to Sundar on the cost saving point. But just one point, we're really pleased as well that Cloud's margin improved as it did and in part, that reflects the revenue strength that they delivered and all of the efficiency efforts that I've already spoken about. But looking ahead in Q3, we do expect the same seasonal pattern that you saw last year with respect to margin, and we are continuing to invest in the business.\nSundar Pichai\nLook, I think specifically, if the question is about engineers and coding, et cetera, we definitely want to be on the cutting edge there. I think we are making these tools available to some of the most productive engineers and demanding engineers out there, and they are definitely kicking the tires hard. And -- but I would say, it's still all in very early stages. I think particularly when it comes to writing high-quality secure code. But I think all the learnings what we are gaining here will translate into our models and products, and that's the virtuous cycle, which I'm excited by. So there's a lot more to come.\nOperator\nThank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.

        "Author": " Alexis Keenan    \u00b7 Senior Legal Reporter",
        "Text": "Alphabet\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) biggest-ever acquisition could face US pushback no matter who wins the White House this November.\nThe reported $23 billion bid to buy fast-growing cloud cybersecurity firm Wiz is the kind that is almost sure to attract scrutiny from Washington competition watchdogs, along with inevitable delays.\nA US regulatory review could stall a tie-up into next year, making it possible that a new administration could be tasked with evaluating its competitive risks.\nThat doesn't necessarily mean Alphabet, which is already fighting antitrust challenges on other fronts, would be free of yet another legal fight.\n\"The current administration looks at vertical issues more heavily than has historically been the case,\" Colin Kass, a partner with Proskauer and co-chair of the firm\u2019s antitrust group, told Yahoo Finance.\n\"But even the prior administration, under Trump, did look at vertical issues even more so than earlier administrations.\"\nThe Biden administration has tried to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\nBut a second Trump administration may not be much friendlier, especially with the giants of Silicon Valley.\nWhen Trump was president last decade, his administration launched antitrust investigations into Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Alphabet's Google. His administration also filed a lawsuit against Google, targeting its dominance as a search engine.\nThat search engine case, which the Biden administration decided to continue, wrapped up earlier this year, and a decision from a judge is expected soon.\nTrump suggested in an interview with Bloomberg Tuesday that major tech companies do need some reining in to limit hazards to children, though he added that he didn't want to go after them violently because the approach could destroy them.\nAnd Trump\u2019s new vice-presidential candidate, Sen. J.D. Vance, has called for the breakup of Google while also expressing admiration for Lina Khan, the Federal Trade Commission boss who has led the scrutiny of a number of merger attempts in the tech world.\n\"I guess I look at Lina Khan as one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job,\" Vance said in February.\nA former FTC official who spoke with Yahoo Finance and asked to remain anonymous agreed an Alphabet-Wiz deal would spark a review, no matter who is in the White House.\nBut a Trump-led DOJ or FTC, the former official said, would more likely favor concessions from Alphabet over litigation if a review raised competition concerns.\nRegulators could even probe for evidence to learn if Google is already engaged in the cloud cybersecurity market in hopes of challenging the company on grounds that the deal poses a potential, rather than existing, competition threat.\nThe former FTC official said that evidence might not support the theory, but such an investigation could be worthwhile for regulators to explore because they are interested in further developing the law on potential threats.\nThat, too, could take up substantial time.\nIf a deal to buy Wiz does in fact move forward, either the DOJ or FTC would lead any ensuing investigation.\nAt preliminary stages, merger and acquisition reviews typically span 30 days, with room for extensions. If officials decide to move beyond preliminary review to what\u2019s known as a second request, the additional investigation can take six to 18 months.\nOnly then, once a second request is completed, could a legal challenge to the transaction happen.\n\"So we're talking at a minimum of probably eight months before there's an actual challenge and, more likely, a year or more before there's an actual challenge,\" Kass said.\nThe antitrust experts said competition concerns could include fears that an acquisition would give Alphabet\u2019s Google an opportunity to disadvantage rivals or diminish competition in a downstream market.\nNew York University professor Lawrence White said an Alphabet-Wiz deal could also receive scrutiny from regulators abroad.\nThat would pose additional complications for the companies since the EU keeps turning up the heat on US tech giants.\nJust last month European regulators hit Microsoft (MSFT) with an antitrust charge one day after the same regulatory body charged Apple with violating European Union competition law.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "Where Will Alphabet Stock Be in 1 Year?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) posted its second-quarter earnings on July 23. The tech giant's revenue rose 14% year over year to $84.74 billion, beating analysts' estimates by $450 million, while its earnings per share (EPS) grew 31% to $1.89 and cleared the consensus forecast by $0.04.\nThose numbers were solid, but some concerns about YouTube's slowing ad sales and OpenAI's new search engine weighed down its stock. Alphabet's stock has still risen nearly 30% over the past 12 months, but can it overcome its near-term challenges and head higher over the next year?\nDuring Q2, Alphabet generated 76% of its revenue from Google's advertising business, which handles its search and display ads, advertising network, and YouTube. Another 12% came from Google Cloud, while 11% came from its paid subscriptions, non-advertising platforms, and hardware devices. Here's how those businesses fared over the past year.\nMetric\nQ2 2023\nQ3 2023\nQ4 2023\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nGoogle Advertising Revenue Growth (YOY)\n3%\n9%\n11%\n13%\n11%\nGoogle Cloud Revenue Growth (YOY)\n28%\n22%\n26%\n28%\n29%\nGoogle Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices Revenue Growth (YOY)\n24%\n21%\n23%\n18%\n14%\nTotal Revenue Growth (YOY)\n7%\n11%\n13%\n15%\n14%\nData source: Alphabet. YOY = Year-over-year.\nGoogle's advertising business suffered a slowdown in 2022 as rising interest rates and other macro headwinds drove many companies to purchase fewer ads. However, its growth accelerated throughout 2023 as the market's robust demand for YouTube and search-based ads offset its declining sales of network-based ads.\nBut that acceleration ended in Q2 as its YouTube ad sales only rose 13% year over year. That marked a significant slowdown from its 21% growth in Q1 and broadly missed analysts' expectations for 17% growth.\nCFO Ruth Porat said Google was \"pleased with YouTube\" during the conference call and didn't offer any clear reasons for its decelerating growth. However, it could be struggling with tough competition from ByteDance's TikTok or other ad-supported, streaming-video platforms -- and it might be cannibalizing its own ad sales with YouTube's paid subscriptions.\nGoogle's \"search and other\" ad revenue still rose 14% year over year, roughly matching its growth rate from the previous quarter, but that steady growth was overshadowed by OpenAI's introduction of its own generative AI search engine, SearchGPT. That announcement could generate unpredictable headwinds for Google, which has already been struggling to keep pace with OpenAI and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) in the artificial intelligence (AI) race.\nGoogle's subscription, platform, and devices growth also decelerated as it lapped its price hike for YouTube TV in the prior-year quarter. The only bright spot was Google Cloud, which accelerated for the third consecutive quarter as the rapid expansion of the AI market drove more companies to upgrade their cloud-infrastructure services.\nAlphabet's revenue growth is cooling again, but its operating margin still held steady sequentially and rose 3 percentage points year over year to 32% in Q2. That expansion was largely driven by its layoffs and other cost-cutting measures, but those strategies could inadvertently throttle its growth by capping its investments.\nThat's why Alphabet is such a polarizing stock. The bulls will point out that it's focusing on expanding its margins, repurchasing more shares through its new $70 billion buyback plan, and finally paying out dividends. The bears will tell you that all of those moves indicate its business is maturing and running out of room to grow.\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Alphabet's revenue and net income to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% and 20%, respectively. Those growth rates are steady, and its stock still looks reasonably valued at 22 times forward earnings. Its forward yield of 0.5% seems paltry, but its low payout ratio of 3% gives it plenty of room for future dividend hikes.\nAssuming Alphabet matches analysts' expectations and its forward valuations hold steady, its stock could rise more than 30% by the end of 2025. But if YouTube's ad sales continue to cool and it struggles to counter Microsoft and OpenAI in the AI market, its stock could be revalued as a mature blue chip tech stock instead of a growth stock. If that happens, we could see its stock flatline or decline over the next 12 months.\nI think Alphabet's multiple could dip over the next year as it grapples with those challenges, but I don't think it will become a value stock anytime soon. Even with a lower forward multiple of 18, it could rise to $180 as it streamlines its business and widens its moat against its advertising, AI, and cloud challengers. It probably won't dazzle the bulls and generate market-beating gains over the next few quarters, but it might still be a stable long-term play for patient investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Aditya Soni and Khushi Singh\n(Reuters) -Alphabet fell more than 3% on Wednesday on fears that its rising investments in AI infrastructure would squeeze margins and YouTube was facing tough competition for ad dollars.\nThe Google parent's capital expenditure rose more than expected in the second quarter to $13.2 billion as it invests heavily in infrastructure needed to support generative AI services, as well as compete with Microsoft.\nWhile Alphabet has been cutting costs through layoffs to protect profitability, several analysts said that seasonally higher hiring of fresh graduates and the earlier-than-usual Pixel launch will weigh on its margins in the third quarter.\nIts YouTube video-streaming service is also grappling with tough year-on-year comparisons and competition in the market for online ad videos from the likes of Amazon.com.\nYouTube ad sales grew 13% in the second quarter, compared with an increase of nearly 21% in the first quarter.\n\"Management sounded quite conservative about the outlook for the second half of the year,\" Bernstein analysts said.\n\"Perhaps this is Google's way of setting an easy bar for the new CFO to come in against the next quarter. Or perhaps there's some truth to the conservatism and we are entering an uncomfortable period for the digital advertising names with decelerating growth and rising costs.\"\nShares of other digital ad-reliant firms such as Meta Platforms, Snap and Pinterest were down between 3.2% and 4% as growth slowed at Alphabet's core Search business despite beating estimates.\nAlphabet was on track to lose around $60 billion in market value on Wednesday. Its stock has gained about 30% so far this year, benefiting from the rally in AI-related stocks.\nDespite the drop, many analysts were positive on Alphabet, pointing to signs that its AI efforts were driving up cloud revenue and that there was little disruption to Search revenue from the AI overviews it rolled out widely earlier this year.\nRevenue from cloud computing services rose 28.8%, faster than expectations, in a positive sign for enterprise spending.\n\"We continue to view Google as an AI winner and find core product improvements encouraging,\" Piper Sandler analysts said.\nAt least 25 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, pushing up the median view to $204. Alphabet's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio stands at 22.2, compared with AI chip firm Nvidia's 38.6, according to LSEG data.\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni and Khushi Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)\n"

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is one of the top growth stocks in the world. With dominant businesses like YouTube and Google Search, the company attracts massive amounts of web traffic and advertising revenue. And with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), it can potentially leverage this technology to get even more out of those businesses, creating value for users and shareholders.\nGiven the potential for AI to transform Alphabet's business, is the stock likely to double in value over the next five years?\nAlthough Alphabet is one of the largest companies in the world with a market cap of $2.3 trillion as of this writing, it's not an expensive stock given how much profit it generates. Investors are paying just under 30 times earnings\u00a0to own a piece of the business. By comparison, rival Microsoft trades at 40 times earnings, while Amazon sports a price-to-earnings ratio of 57.\nWhile Alphabet stock has risen 37% year to date, its valuation hasn't ballooned. And that can help it deliver stronger returns in the long run with more potential upside for what's still a modestly-valued stock.\nBut the business itself still has to perform well, and that could come down to what impact AI has on the company.\nThere's a lot of excitement around what AI can do for Alphabet and other companies. But for it to double in value, it will need to demonstrate that AI will help its business more than hurt it. That's by no means a given at the moment.\nIf people go to AI offerings like ChatGPT rather than Google Search for their queries, that will diminish the value of Alphabet's popular search engine, especially to advertisers. However, if the company can use AI to enhance its own services, that will likely be pivotal to its growth over the next five years.\nAlphabet's growth rate has already been accelerating in recent quarters, though it's slightly trailing its 10-year average.\nSo, the assumption investors should be careful not to make is that AI will be a net positive for Alphabet. Execution will need to improve as the rollout of some of the company's early AI features have run into problems.\nAlphabet is likely to grow bigger and more profitable in the years ahead. However, that doesn't mean the stock will double over this period. AI still poses a considerable threat and opportunity to its online empire. Growth investors should understand that while Alphabet's modest valuation does make its shares an attractive buy right now, the significant growth needed to see the stock double over the next five years is anything but certain.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) shareholders are probably feeling a little disappointed, since its shares fell 5.9% to US$167 in the week after its latest second-quarter results. Alphabet reported US$85b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.89 beat expectations, being 2.3% higher than what the analysts expected. The analysts typically update their forecasts at each earnings report, and we can judge from their estimates whether their view of the company has changed or if there are any new concerns to be aware of. We thought readers would find it interesting to see the analysts latest (statutory) post-earnings forecasts for next year.\n View our latest analysis for Alphabet \nAfter the latest results, the 49 analysts covering Alphabet are now predicting revenues of US$345.7b in 2024. If met, this would reflect an okay 5.3% improvement in revenue compared to the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to increase 7.2% to US$7.63. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$347.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$7.57 in 2024. So it's pretty clear that, although the analysts have updated their estimates, there's been no major change in expectations for the business following the latest results.\nThe analysts reconfirmed their price target of US$204, showing that the business is executing well and in line with expectations. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Alphabet analyst has a price target of US$230 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$151. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.\nThese estimates are interesting, but it can be useful to paint some more broad strokes when seeing how forecasts compare, both to the Alphabet's past performance and to peers in the same industry. We would highlight that Alphabet's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 11% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 16% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this to the 123 other companies in this industry with analyst coverage, which are forecast to grow their revenue at 10% per year. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it looks like Alphabet is forecast to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.\nThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$204, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Alphabet going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here..\nWe also provide an overview of the Alphabet Board and CEO remuneration and length of tenure at the company, and whether insiders have been buying the stock,  here.\nHave feedback on this article?

The Italian Competition Authority has launched an investigation into Google and its parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), regarding their methods for obtaining user consent for linking data across various services.\nThe probe focuses on how Google requests consent from users to link data across its services, such as Google Search, YouTube, Chrome, and Maps.\nThe Italian regulator suspects that Google may provide inadequate or misleading information about the effects of this consent.\nThe Authority alleges that Google's consent requests might lack transparency about the scope and implications of combining user data across multiple services. This could lead users to unknowingly consent to broader data use than intended.\nThe investigation also examines whether Google employs techniques that could influence consumer decisions.\nThe Authority is concerned that these methods might pressure users into consenting to data practices they might otherwise reject.\nIn response to the investigation, a Google spokesperson stated, \"We will analyze the details of this case and will work cooperatively with the Authority,\" TechCrunch reports.\nAlso Read: Google And Microsoft Provide Nvidia Chip Access To Chinese Firms Despite U.S. Restrictions: Report\nGoogle has been subject to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) since early March, which mandates that companies obtain explicit consent before processing users' personal data for advertising or combining data from different services.\nThe DMA, which includes regulations that align with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), requires consent to be \"freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.\"\nThis investigation could have significant implications for how Google manages user data within the European Union.\nHowever, Google has announced some of the changes including a new search page layout for European users, with dedicated aggregator units with links to aggregator sites from across the web to comply with the DMA.\nItaly's investigation also touches on the broader issue of \"dark patterns\" in online consent flows, where design techniques can manipulate users into making choices they might not otherwise make.\nThe EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) bans such deceptive designs, aiming to protect users' ability to make free and informed decisions.\nAlphabet stock has gained about 43% in the last 12 months.

        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 15% over the last three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Alphabet's  ROE in this article.\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:\n28% = US$82b \u00f7 US$293b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.28.\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nTo begin with, Alphabet has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 7.4% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, Alphabet was able to see a decent net income growth of 18% over the last five years.\nAs a next step, we compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 6.0%.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is GOOGL fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Alphabet's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Since Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nThe second half of 2024 is here and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve remain elusive, with warnings about valuations and AI-led market hype growing louder. A number of notable Wall Street analysts have recently warned that the markets remains more concentrated than ever where just a few stocks account for most of the gains, thanks to their dominance in the AI industry. Many also believe the market is up for a correction as it has entered the overbought territory. Financial services company BTIG recently said in a report that the world\u2019s fifth-largest exchange-traded fund by assets under management (AUM), QQQ Trust Series 1, now trades \u201cwell into\u201d overbought territory based on its Relative Strength Index technical indicator.\u00a0 QQQ tracks \u00a0the Nasdaq-100 Index and it\u2019s not surprising to see the ETF showing signs of being overbought as more and more investors pile into mega-cap tech stocks in order to ride the AI bandwagon.\nFor this article we scanned the holdings of the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF and picked top technology holdings of the fund with higher Relative Strength Index (RSI) values. Usually, an RSI value of 60 and above shows a stock is overbought. We have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors with these stocks.

If the deal were to proceed, it would mark the tech behemoth\u2019s largest ever acquisition.\nBelow, we take a closer look the Alphabet\u2019s weekly chart and use technical analysis to identify important levels to watch out for.\nSince bottoming out around the 200-week moving average (MA) early last year, Alphabet shares have continued to trend higher, with investors promptly buying the dips.\nMore recently, the stock climbed to a record high on Wednesday, but closed lower for the week, potentially setting the stage for a retracement. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that trading volumes have trended lower since the stock gapped nearly 7% after Bloomberg reported in mid March that the tech giant was in talks to license its Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) models to Apple (AAPL), potentially alluding to slowing buying momentum.\nIf a pullback eventuates, investors should monitor three key areas where the stock would likely encounter support.\nThe first area to watch sits at $175, where the shares may attract buying interest near a series of similar prices between late April and early June.\nA close below this level could see a retest of the $150 area, a region likely to attract buyers near the rising 50-week MA and a key horizontal line linking several prior record highs in the stock from November 2021 to January this year.\nFurther weakness could trigger a fall to around $134, where bargain hunters may seek lower-priced buying opportunities near a multi-year trendline.\nTo gauge a potential longer-term upside price target, we can take the a bars pattern from the stock\u2019s upward move between March last year and January this year and overlay it from the March swing low. This projects a target of around $215, an area where the stock may face selling pressure, especially if other technical indicators point to overbought conditions at the same time.\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

Lip said that he\u2019s still bullish on tech stocks and a single event does not show a trend.

Lip noted that small-cap stocks, real estate stocks, among others, gained ground on the back of this trend.\nHowever, Lip has high expectations from the upcoming earnings reports from tech companies. He also said that July has been one of the strongest months for tech stocks. Lip, however, said that major tech companies cannot go on to post record gains and their returns are expected to \u201cfall in line with historical returns.\u201d\nLip thinks the economy is entering a \u201cGoldilocks scenario\u201d where growth is steady but not \u201chot enough\u201d to cause inflation. He reiterated his view that he expects strong earnings growth this year and in 2025, which could be a tailwind for stocks.\nAsked what would cause earnings growth of tech companies, Lip said a lot of that comes down to efficient management and strong cash piles these companies have. He also said \u201cslightly\u201d lower interest rates could also be a tailwind for the economy.\nSince Lip is bullish on tech stocks and believes major AI companies still have upside potential, we decided to take a look at the top names in his portfolio.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this internet search leader have returned +0.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 1.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.61 points to a change of +31.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.61 indicates a change of +13.1% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nRevenue Growth Forecast\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $70.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.7%. The $291.18 billion and $324.85 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.5% and +11.6%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been a long-term winner on the stock market as its dominance of online search and digital advertising has delivered strong growth and steady returns, fueling new businesses as well, like Google Cloud.\nHowever, investors were underwhelmed by Alphabet's second-quarter earnings report as the stock fell on the news even though the company beat analyst estimates. YouTube revenue growth was weaker than expected and fears about increasing spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure weighed on the stock.\nNow, one Wall Street analyst sees an opportunity in the sell-off as the stock is down 7% since the earnings report.\nIn a note published Monday morning, Phillip Securities raised its rating on Alphabet from accumulate to buy and lifted its price target on the tech giant from $195 to $205.\nThe company noted that Alphabet is the leader in digital advertising, and the analyst called it the market leader in artificial intelligence as well. While there doesn't seem to be a clear leader in AI applications at the moment as it's still early in the industry's development, Alphabet is certainly among the leaders, given products like its Gemini chatbot and AI assistant and its Waymo autonomous vehicle subsidiary.\nAlphabet still faces risks, including a new search product from ChatGPT, but the company has overcome early doubts about its ability to keep pace with Microsoft and OpenAI, and the company has a long history of delivering growth despite a wide range of challenges. In other words, it's always paid off to buy the dip in Alphabet stock.\nThe company's competitive advantages seem as formidable as they ever have and the earnings results were strong despite the sell-off.

The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. This is not the case here.

You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nStrong Generative AI Capabilities\nAlphabet has been cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. This is likely to have benefited the quarterly performance significantly.\u00a0Growing momentum in Google\u2019s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is anticipated to have been a positive.\u00a0Google\u2019s introduction of various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure is another plus. The company\u2019s launch of an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool called Gemini Code Assist is noteworthy. These tools are likely to have contributed well to top-line growth by delivering enhanced user experience.\nStrength in Search, YouTube & Ad \nAlphabet division Google\u2019s continued efforts toward innovation in AI techniques for the advancement of its search segment, which accounts for a major portion of its total revenues, are expected to have driven traffic on its platform in the to-be-reported quarter.The integration of generative AI technology into the search engine is expected to have continued to benefit Google Search. With the large language models (LLM), GOOGL is likely to have driven its search momentum in the second quarter. LLMs, coupled with multi-search and visual exploration features, are expected to have continued improving the search results.The Search Generative Experience (\u201cSGE\u201d), which leverages generative AI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, is likely to have contributed well.The company\u2019s strength in the mobile search category on the back of mobile-friendly algorithms, robust product listings and flight search capabilities is a plus. It is likely to have boosted the search traffic on the Chrome browser in the second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Search & Other revenues is pegged at $47.46 billion, indicating an increase of 11.3% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.Coming to the advertisement business, Alphabet\u2019s growing efforts to deliver better performance and profitability to advertisers on the back of foundational research models and LLMs are expected to have contributed well.SGE is expected to have aided the advertisement business as it can create relevant, customized and high-quality ads. The strength in the conversational experience of Google Ads and Performance Max is likely to have driven the company\u2019s momentum among advertisers in the second quarter. The improving performance of YouTube ads is anticipated to have been another positive.The consensus mark for Google advertising is pegged at $64.28 billion, implying growth of 10.5% from the prior-year quarter\u2019s reported figure.Coming to non-advertisement revenues of YouTube, strengthening user momentum in YouTube Shorts is likely to have been a tailwind. Google\u2019s growing efforts to bolster relationships with content creators are likely to have acted as a positive.The growing momentum across Android and Pixel devices is expected to have benefited Alphabet\u2019s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.The above-mentioned factors are anticipated to have benefited Google\u2019s Services segment\u2019s performance in the second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Services revenues is pegged at $73.43 billion, indicating growth of 10.8% from the year-ago reported figure.\nGrowing Cloud & Other Bets Businesses\nAlphabet has been rapidly growing in the booming cloud-computing market. Google Cloud has solidified its position as the third-largest provider in the highly competitive cloud infrastructure market against Amazon\u2019s AMZN AWS and Microsoft\u2019s MSFT Azure, which hold the first and second positions, respectively.Google Cloud has turned out to be the key growth driver for Alphabet, owing to strengthening cloud service offerings. The solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace is expected to have driven growth in the Google Cloud segment.Google\u2019s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI are expected to have been major positives.Its strengthening generative AI-backed cloud offerings are expected to have driven Google\u2019s momentum among cloud customers in the quarter-to-be-reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Google Cloud revenues is pegged at $10.08 billion, suggesting growth of 25.5% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.Alphabet\u2019s strengthening efforts to bolster its healthcare technology portfolio are expected to have driven growth in its Other Bets segment in the second quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Other Bets revenues is pegged at $414.82 million, suggesting growth of 45.6% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.\nAlphabet\u2019s shares have appreciated 31.5% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry, S&P 500 index and the Zacks Computer and Technology sector\u2019s rally of 28.8%, 17% and 25.6%, respectively.Alphabet has also outperformed its cloud peers Amazon and Microsoft\u2019s growth of 27.1% and 19.6% year to date, respectively.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nNow, let us look at the value GOOGL offers investors at current levels.\nCurrently, GOOGL is trading at a discount, with a forward 12-month P/E of 22.56X compared with the industry\u2019s 23.68X, indicating a good entry point for investors.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet faces significant litigation across various regions, especially the United States and the European Union. Regulatory scrutiny continues to worsen, with the competition commission issuing several statements of objections. Stiff competition in various fields, such as cloud computing and generative AI space, does not bode well for its market position.Nevertheless, it is hard to ignore Alphabet\u2019s growing efforts to bolster its generative AI capabilities. Its leading position in the search engine space, strengthening cloud footprint, solid momentum in YouTube and Android, and growing traction in the autonomous driving space should aid Alphabet\u2019s prospects.\nAlthough Alphabet presents a compelling investment opportunity, owing to its fundamental strength, investors should take a nuanced approach as both opportunities and challenges warrant careful consideration.

        "Author": "  Ethan Feller ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) reported earnings Tuesday and beat analysts\u2019 estimates on both the top and bottom line, yet the stock is rolling over. Is it time to get out of the stock? I think not, and rather it be a fantastic buying opportunity.\nThere are two primary reasons for Alphabet's sell-off following its recent earnings report, both of which I believe are temporary. First, the overall market weakness is weighing on the stock. Second, there are concerns about whether the significant capital expenditures on AI infrastructure will generate sufficient near-term profits.\nWhile the concerns are reasonable, Alphabet is such a sturdy asset, that I believe you can overlook any near-term concerns as the long-term still looks so fruitful for the company.\nBut what is especially compelling is that GOOGL is trading at a relatively discounted valuation, while business fundamentals are strong, and the company enters exciting new technological ventures.\nFor investors who are keen on buying leading technology stocks at a discount, Alphabet may be the next addition to your portfolio.\nImage Source: TradingView\nEarnings Beat but the Alphabet Stock Falls\nAlphabet has reported a solid second quarter for 2024, showcasing strong performance across its key segments and continued innovation in artificial intelligence. The company's results underline its robust financial health and strategic investments in AI and cloud infrastructure.\nAlphabet delivered revenues of $85 billion, marking a 14% year-on-year increase. This growth was driven by strong performance in Search and Cloud services. The Cloud segment achieved quarterly revenues exceeding $10 billion for the first time, alongside a notable $1 billion in operating profit.\nSearch revenues reached $48.5 billion, growing 13.8% year-over-year while Cloud revenues saw a slight acceleration, growing 28.8% to $10.4 billion. AI is playing a pivotal role here, with the majority of Alphabet's top 100 customers utilizing AI-driven services.\nAdditionally, seeing a reacceleration of the core search business is a fantastic development as many investors had begun to doubt it.\nFurthermore, notes about the development at Waymo are very encouraging and has to potential to open another massive business opportunity for Alphabet. \u00a0\nHuge Potential in Autonomous Driving \nAlphabet announced that they would be committing another $5 billion to expansion at Waymo, and I think investors are still underestimating the incredible potential here.\nWaymo has made significant strides, delivering over 50,000 paid rides per week across San Francisco and Phoenix. But most importantly, Waymo has focused on optimizing its service for profitability and scalability, making strategic decisions that enhance its configurability across various vehicle types and conditions.\nThis is a very different approach than Tesla (TSLA) is taking, as Alphabet believes providing the underlying technology will be a superior business model and is similar to the way GOOGL influences the mobile computing industry with Android. They make no devices but are the most widely used mobile software in the world.\nWaymo is also taking a bottom\u2019s up approach, developing its own sensors so to control the whole tech stack. Alternatively, Tesla relies solely on camera-based vision and must manage all the additional logistics of producing a full vehicle. The longer it takes Tesla to get full self-driving to actually work, the more I am favoring Waymo in leading the industry.\nAlphabet Stock Trading at a Discount \nAs noted, Alphabet is trading at a valuation that I consider to be appealing for long-term investors. Today, GOOGL is trading at 22x forward earnings, which is below its 10-year median of 26.1x and below the market average.\nBecause I believe Alphabet is among the best companies in the world, I think it unreasonable that it trades in line with the average of the index. With continued strong performance across business segments, and some incredible growth catalysts, I think Alphabet is compelling at current levels.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFinal Thoughts\nDespite Alphabet's recent post-earnings dip, this may be an opportune moment for investors to buy the stock.\nAlphabet's second-quarter earnings report showed strong performance across key segments, with impressive growth in Search and Cloud services. The company continues to lead in AI-driven innovations, reinforcing its competitive edge. Additionally, the significant investment in Waymo highlights Alphabet's potential in the autonomous driving market, offering another promising growth avenue.\nAt its current valuation, Alphabet presents an attractive opportunity for long-term investors. For investors seeking to capitalize on a leading technology stock at a discount, Alphabet is a compelling choice.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Greg Bensinger and Yuvraj Malik ",
        "Text": "By Greg Bensinger and Yuvraj Malik\n(Reuters) -Alphabet beat second-quarter revenue and profit estimates on Tuesday, driven by a rise in digital advertising sales and healthy demand for its cloud computing services, but flagged that capital expenses would remain high for the year.\nAlphabet's results underscore robust demand for digital ads, driven by events like the Paris Olympics and elections in several countries including the U.S., while a recovery in enterprise spending is boosting its software business.\nStrong adoption of generative artificial intelligence technology drove its cloud business.\nAdvertising sales, Alphabet's chief revenue source, rose 11% to $64.6 billion. The company sells ads in its search product using customer data to better target them.\nNet income in the quarter ended June 30 rose 28.6% to $23.6 billion, besting the average estimate of $22.9 billion.\nInvestor reaction was mixed, with the shares initially rising about 2% before dipping by a similar percentage. They had gained more than 30% this year, outperforming a 20% rise in tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index.\n\"This was another stellar quarter from Google with beats across the board,\" said Ido Caspi a research analyst with Global X, citing ad sales and artificial intelligence offerings as drivers.\nTotal revenue grew 14% to $84.74 billion, compared with analysts' consensus estimate of $84.19 billion according to LSEG data. Ad sales in its YouTube division rose 13% to $8.67 billion.\nRevenue from cloud computing services, a widely watched barometer for the health of enterprise technology spending, rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion. Analysts had expected $10.16 billion.\nAlphabet reported capital expenditures of $13 billion in the June quarter. Ruth Porat, in her last conference call as Alphabet's chief financial officer, told investors that quarterly capital expenditures for the rest of 2024 would be at or above $12 billion.\nIn the January-March period, the company's capital expenditure had jumped 91% to $12 billion, spooking investors.\nLike its competitors, Alphabet is racing to roll out AI offerings as investors continue to pour billions into the technology.\nBut its AI searches have produced a series of embarrassing results, such as the widely ridiculed suggestion to put glue on pizza to better hold cheese. Google pulled back on the technology in May to work out kinks.\nThe technology will be rolled out to more countries, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told investors on a call on Tuesday. \"You'll see us expand the use cases around it.\"\nPichai, without providing a timeline, said AI products could soon drive revenue rather than just help companies through cost-cutting and greater efficiency.\nDespite heightened regulatory scrutiny, Google had been pursuing its largest acquisition ever, a roughly $23 billion buyout of cybersecurity firm Wiz. But Wiz told employees on Monday it was walking away from the deal and would instead pursue going public.\nGoogle also held talks to acquire customer relationship management firm HubSpot before walking away from it earlier this month. The deal would have turned Alphabet into a rival of Salesforce, Oracle and others in that market.\nGoogle said on Monday it is planning to keep third-party cookies in its Chrome browser backtracking function after years of pledging to phase out the tiny packets of code used to track internet searches.\nIt marked a major reversal after advertisers expressed concerns that the loss of cookies would limit their ability to collect and parse information for personalizing ads, making them dependent on Google's user databases.\nSales for the Mountain View, California company's so-called \"other bets,\" including experimental projects and its self-driving car unit Waymo, rose 28% to $365 million. Porat said the company is planning a multi-year $5 billion investment in Waymo, as rival Cruise slowly maps a course back to U.S. roads after a highly publicized accident in October.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Devika Syamnath and Richard Chang)\n"

But recent enthusiasm behind a Tesla robotaxi, shareholder approval of Musk\u2019s controversial pay package, and new growth in Tesla\u2019s energy business has sent shares on a steep rise \u2014 nearly 38% in the past month.\nBut a pushback of Tesla\u2019s robotaxi reveal has given investors pause. Musk all but confirmed last week that Tesla would be delaying its robotaxi reveal, which was slated for Aug. 8.\n\u201cRequested what I think is an important design change to the front, and extra time allows us to show off a few other things,\u201d Musk tweeted in reply to a post regarding changes and a delay to the robotaxi.\nWith a robotaxi date in limbo, investors expect Tesla and Musk to give an update on the car's debut.\nAs for the quarter itself, Tesla is expected to report Q2 revenue of $24.59 billion per Bloomberg consensus, higher than the $21.30 billion it reported in Q1, but a shade lower than the $24.93 Tesla reported a year ago. The street expects Tesla to post adjusted EPS of $0.60 on adjusted net income of $2.15 billion and operating profit of $1.88 billion, per Bloomberg.\nGoogle parent company Alphabet will be another key name to watch after the bell.\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley points out the tech giant is coming off of an impressive first quarter during which it announced it initiated its first dividend of $0.20 per share and authorized stock repurchases of $70 billion.\nAlphabet shares are up 30% year to date. Shares of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are up 18% and 22% year to date, respectively. All three companies are pouring money into building out their generative AI capabilities, spending lavishly on data centers capable of powering the AI models they offer via their cloud service platforms.\nFor the quarter, analysts are anticipating earnings per share of $1.85 on revenue of $84.35 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would be a major jump from the same period last year when the company reported earnings per share of $1.44 on revenue of $74.6 billion.\nWall Street expects advertising revenue to top $64.5 billion, up from $58.1 billion last year. That includes year-over-year increases in Google Search & other, YouTube ads, and Google Network revenue, pointing to a positive advertising environment. A beat by Alphabet could also buoy shares of ad business rival Meta (META).\nComcast (CMCSA) said Tuesday it's confident it will clinch an 11-year NBA media rights deal, despite Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD) TNT Network exercising its matching rights the day prior.\nWarner Bros. has aired a portion of games through its TNT network since 1989. It reportedly shells out $1.2 billion annually for the rights, which expire at the end of next season. The company revealed Monday it has matched a media rights bid to continue airing NBA games, but it's unclear if the league will continue the partnership.\n\"Our expectation is that soon, an 11-year rights deal between ourselves and the NBA will be announced,\" Comcast president Michael Cavanagh said during the company's second quarter earnings call. \"We don't believe that the resolution of matching rights will affect the package that we expect to be awarded.\"\nCavanagh said the package will include 100 regular-season games, which will air across NBC and Peacock. That's \"more than any other media partner and more regular-season games than each existing partner has under the current rights deal,\" the executive said.\nFor playoffs, NBC will have the exclusive rights to the first- and second-round games each year on its national platforms. It will also host six NBA conference final series over the course of the deal, \"which is more playoff games on average each year than any other media partner.\"\nPeacock, meanwhile, will exclusively stream about 50 national regular season and postseason games.\nIn total, the NBA has reportedly secured a media rights package worth around $76 billion over 11 years \u2014 a bullish sign when it comes to the importance of sports to both streamers and traditional broadcast and cable providers.\n\"Sports as a cornerstone will ensure that Peacock is relevant,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett wrote in reaction to the results. \"They have a place at the table in the consolidation to come. We observed last quarter that Peacock is blessed to have Comcast\u2019s strong balance sheet behind it.\"\nPeacock losses narrowed to $348 million in the quarter, down from $651 million in the year-ago period and $639 million in the first quarter of 2024. The streamer also grew its subscriber base by 38% year over year to 33 million, although subscribers dipped by about 500,000 on a quarter-over-quarter basis amid recent price hikes.\n\"Adding the NBA will mean an even longer path to profitability,\" Moffett noted. \"But for now, the losses at Peacock are, thankfully, getting smaller.\"\nRead more here.\nAs investors grew more confident over the past month that former President Donald Trump will win the 2024 election, certain pockets of the stock market have outperformed.\nThe \"Trump trade,\"  as some on Wall Street have dubbed the move, has been headlined by bets on energy companies, increased mergers and acquisitions, and higher bond yields, a sign investors are betting on a continued higher-inflation regime under a Trump presidency.\nA submission from Oxford Economics lead US economist Bernard Yaros in volume three of the Yahoo Finance Chartbook helps explain why. Yaros work shows the most inflationary outcome for the 2024 election cycle would be a Trump victory and a Republican sweep of both the House and the Senate.\n\"The inflationary impact is greatest in a 'full-blown Trump' scenario where a Republican trifecta doubles down on tax cuts, higher defense spending, and tariffs,\" Yaros told Yahoo Finance. \"Even in a 'limited Trump' scenario, where a Republican trifecta doesn\u2019t loosen fiscal policy or raise tariffs to the same extent, inflation is still meaningfully higher.\"\nExchange-traded funds that hold ether (ETH-USD) began their first day of trading Tuesday following final approval from regulators the day prior.\nBut despite the debut, ether prices dropped 1.5% in afternoon trading.\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger and David Hollerith report:\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission gave the green light Monday to BlackRock (BLK), Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, and 21 Shares, the companies said.\nThe moves could make ether, the world\u2019s second-largest cryptocurrency, a potential staple in 401(k)s, IRAs, and pension plans and grant the digital asset more mainstream acceptance.\n\"This is exemplary of Fidelity's rich history and commitment to meeting the evolving needs of our customers,\" Fidelity's head of digital asset management, Cynthia Lo Bessette, said in a press release.\nThe approvals come roughly six months after the SEC permitted many of these same money managers to launch ETFs that hold bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency.\nThe new development is the latest example of the recent success the crypto industry is having in Washington as it pushes for friendlier regulation and greater freedom to launch new products.\nIt comes just days before the Republican nominee for president, Donald Trump, offers his stamp of approval when he speaks before the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville this weekend.\nTrump and many in his party have embraced digital assets as they seek to draw a contrast with the Biden administration, which led a crackdown on many of the industry\u2019s major players following a market meltdown in 2022.\nThe GOP said in its 16-page party platform last week that \"Republicans will end Democrats\u2019 unlawful and unAmerican Crypto crackdown.\"\nTrump, who in the past has called bitcoin a \"scam,\" referred to cryptocurrencies as \"amazing\" in an interview with Bloomberg published last week.\nThe price of bitcoin is up more than 6% over the past month to roughly $68,000, putting it within striking distance of an all-time high set earlier this year.\nEther has fallen 0.5% over the past five days. It has traded down in recent months and remains far off its all-time high set in November 2021.\nThe stock market rally of 2024 has come with limited gut-check moments for investors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).\nThe benchmark index is up about 17% this year and has only seen a maximum drawdown of less than 6% so far this year.\nBMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski pointed out in the latest volume of the Yahoo Finance Chartbook that the S&P 500 typically sees a sharper pullback in the second year of a bull market. Dating back to 1949, Belski's work shows the average drawdown in the second year of a bull market is 9.4%.\n\"The market's ripe for a pullback from a sentiment perspective,\" Belski said.\nBut the catch is that Belski believes that will be an \"opportunity for investors,\" given that stocks usually bounce back by 14.5% from drawdowns in a bull market.\n\"Stock are going to be higher at year-end,\" said Belski, who sees the Federal Reserve easing interest rates leading to a \"Goldilocks\" era for the US economy, where growth remains steady while inflation eases.\nBelski added, \"It's all part of our 25-year secular bull market call, which we've had in place since 2010.\"\nClick here to view 32 charts from the Yahoo Finance Chartbook that tell the story of markets and the economy right now.\nStocks turned positive in late morning trade on Tuesday.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) was more than 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose about 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up more than 0.1%.\nFinancials (XLF) were the only sector outperforming the broader S&P 500 index on Tuesday. And the rally in banks trickled down the cap spectrum to regional banks too. The S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) was up nearly 2%.\nThe small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index, which is heavily influenced by regional banks, was up about 0.9% on the day.\nSpotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal second quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations as the audio giant posted record profit, gross margin, and free cash flow in the quarter on the heels of its recent \"efficiency\" strategy.\nRevenue came in line with estimates while monthly active user metrics disappointed, both of which investors shrugged off as the stock surged more than 10% in early trading.\nIn June, Spotify announced it would hike the prices of its premium US subscription plans, with increases set to take effect this month. Spotify previously raised prices last summer.\nOn top of price adjustments, the company has committed to multiple rounds of layoffs and initiatives to boost top-line growth and improve margins, like a music-only streaming tier and audiobooks-only plan. It also introduced a higher-priced audio bundle that includes music, podcasts, and audiobooks.\nThe audio giant reported operating income of 266 million euros ($289 million), compared with a loss of 247 million euros in the prior-year period. This was above company guidance of 250 million euros, driven by \"lower personnel and related costs and lower marketing spend.\"\nIt also guided to a strong Q3 operating income of 405 million euros ($440 million), well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations of 298.1 million euros.\nThe streaming service reported net income of 274 million euros ($298 million), or earnings of 1.33 euros per share. That was well ahead of analyst expectations of earnings of 1.04 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 302 million euros, or a loss of 1.55 euros a share.\nGross margins came in stronger than expected at 29.2%, beating company guidance of 28.1%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick up to 30.2% in the third quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.\nSpotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business.\nRevenue, meanwhile, met expectations of 3.81 billion euros ($4.14 billion) \u2014 20% higher compared with the second quarter of 2023. The company expects revenue to hit 4 billion euros in Q3 versus the 3.4 billion euros in the year-ago period.\nWall Street analysts credited Spotify's gross margin beat and better-than-expected guidance for Q3 operating income and gross margins as key catalysts for the positive stock reaction.\nRead more here. \nGeneral Motors (GM) stock fell more than 6% despite reporting second quarter results that came in better than Wall Street expected.\nYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian has the details on the report:\nGM (GM) once again posted strong second quarter results, and boosted its guidance for a second time this year as customers continue buying the Detroit-based automaker's gas-powered vehicles, trucks \u2014 and even EVs.\nFor the quarter, GM reported record revenue of $47.97 billion versus $45.51 billion estimated (Bloomberg consensus), which represents a 7.2% jump compared to a year ago ($44.75 billion). GM reported adjusted EPS of $3.06, compared to estimates of $2.70, with GM also reporting adjusted EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of $4.438 billion, easily topping estimates of $3.88 billion.\nIn terms of guidance, GM reported the following updates to its full-year 2024 forecast:\nExisting home sales declined in June for the fourth consecutive month as high mortgage rates continued to pressure potential buyers.\nSales of previously owned homes fell 5.4% in June from May to 3.89 million units on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were also down 5.4% year over year.\nThe drop in sales underscores how high mortgage rates and home prices are keeping a lid on buying activity. June also marked the second consecutive month of home prices reaching an all-time high. The average price tag on a previously owned home increased 4.1% from a year earlier to $426,900, the NAR said.\nThat rise in home prices has suppressed buyer appetite. At the end of June, unsold homes for sale grew 3.1% to 1.32 million, according to the NAR, and marked a 23% gain from last year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a slow shift from a seller\u2019s market to a buyer\u2019s market,\u201d said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun. \u201cHomes are sitting on the market a bit longer and sellers are receiving fewer offers. More buyers are insisting on home inspections and appraisals, and inventory is definitively rising on a national basis.\u201d\nUS stocks wobbled on Tuesday as investors weighed early reports on a marquee earnings day, with Big Tech results later in focus as potential fuel to sustain this year's rally.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell just below the flat line while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped more than 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was down about 0.1%.\nThe minor declines came after Big Tech stocks led a rally in markets on Monday.\nSimilar to my prior post comparing FedEx (FDX) to UPS (UPS), you have to do the same thing always with Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP).\nCoca-Cola easily wins the battle of the second quarters. The two things that stood to me from the results this morning were a 15% organic sales increase and a nice pop in operating margins year over year. PepsiCo pretty much delivered the opposite.\nCoke also lifted guidance; PepsiCo no go.\nIn what is becoming a recurring theme dating back to the middle of last year, General Motors (GM) once again hiked its annual profit forecast after a sizable quarterly beat.\nGM sees full-year adjusted earnings of $9.50 to $10.50 a share. Previously, it had modeled for $9 to $10 a share. The company beat second quarter earnings estimates by $0.31.\nFor the year, it reiterated a recently lowered goal of producing 200,000 to 250,000 EVs.\nI am talking to GM CFO Paul Jacobson around 8 a.m. ET today. Keep an eye out for that interview airing in the 9 a.m. ET hour live on Yahoo Finance.\nAll in all, GM continues to regain its cred with investors.\nThe sentiment around FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) has really shifted, with the former seen as a solid play on tons of cost cutting while the latter is out of favor because of bad quarters.\nTo that end, another tough quarter for UPS this morning. I don't think the full-year operating margin cut is going to be well-received by investors.\n"

        "Title": "Should You Be Adding Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) To Your Watchlist Today?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Alphabet with the means to add long-term value to shareholders.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. It certainly is nice to see that Alphabet has managed to grow EPS by 21% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.\nTop-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. The good news is that Alphabet is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 5.1 percentage points to 30%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.\nYou can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Alphabet's future profits.\nSince Alphabet has a market capitalisation of US$2.3t, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$242b. This suggests that leadership will be very mindful of shareholders' interests when making decisions!\nIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Alphabet, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$14m.\nAlphabet's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$8.8m in the year leading up to December 2023. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO compensation is hardly the most important aspect of a company to consider, but when it's reasonable, that gives a little more confidence that leadership are looking out for shareholder interests. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.\nYou can't deny that Alphabet has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. The overarching message here is that Alphabet has underlying strengths that make it worth a look at. Once you've identified a business you like, the next step is to consider what you think it's worth. And right now is your chance to view our exclusive discounted cashflow valuation of Alphabet. You might benefit from giving it a glance today.\nThere's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features. You can access a tailored list of companies which have demonstrated growth backed by significant insider holdings.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) closed the latest trading day at $188.19, indicating a +0.75% change from the previous session's end. This change outpaced the S&P 500's 0.28% gain on the day.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN.\nApple\u00a0shares hit a 52-week high of $220.38 on Jul 2 and finally closed at $220.27, up 14.4% year to date. Since Jun 10, when the iPhone maker hosted its annual developers\u2019 event, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple shares have jumped 14.1%, outperforming the Zacks Computer-Miniindustry\u2019s gain of 13.8% and the Zacks Computer & Technologysector\u2019s return of 5.8%.\nLately, AAPL shares have been gaining attention from investors thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, at WWDC.\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\nApple CEO Tim Cook has expressed his enthusiasm over the opportunities with Generative AI (GenAI). In the fiscal second-quarter earnings call, Cook stated that Apple enjoys a significant advantage in the AI space due to \u201cApple\u2019s unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple\u2019s silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy.\u201d\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad, and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple\u2019s stringent privacy standards.\nSiri, powered by Apple Intelligence, has become more natural, contextually aware, and capable of handling complex tasks. Users can communicate with Siri using both voice and text, and the assistant can now maintain context across multiple requests. Siri\u2019s new design features an elegant glowing light around the screen edge when active, and its functionality extends to providing device support and answering detailed questions about using the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\nIn a significant enhancement, Apple is integrating ChatGPT into its platforms, allowing users to access its expertise directly within iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia. Siri can utilize ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities, with user consent, to provide more detailed and accurate information. ChatGPT will also be available in the systemwide Writing Tools, enhancing content creation with advanced language models and image generation.\nApple\u2019s strong balance sheet and robust cash flow generating ability are noteworthy. As of Mar 30, 2024, cash & marketable securities were $162.34 billion compared with term debt of $102.59 billion.\nApple returned nearly $27 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 through dividend payouts ($3.7 billion) and share repurchases ($23.5 billion). Its board authorized an additional $110 billion for share repurchases and also raised dividend payout by 4% to 25 cents per share.\nChina\u2019s growth remains a worry for Apple due to stiff competition from local smartphone makers, including Huawei. The Chinese government\u2019s directive to state officials not to use non-Chinese phones for work has been detrimental to the iPhone\u2019s demand.\nPer Canalys data, the Mainland China smartphone market witnessed 67.7 million units of shipment in first-quarter 2024. Huawei led with a 17% market share, shipping 11.7 million smartphones, while Apple sold 10 million units, down 25% year over year, the most among the top five vendors.\nThe issues forced Apple to cut retail prices, which drove iPhone smartphone shipments in April (up 52% year over year) and is also expected to have benefited May sales. However, Apple is suffering from a lack of GenAI capabilities in the iPhone.\nApple\u2019s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter\u2019s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $83.75 billion, indicating 2.38% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings has increased by a penny to $1.33 per share over the past 30 days.\nMoreover, Apple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 30.63X compared with the Zacks Computer-Mini industry\u2019s 28.58X and higher than the median of 27.37X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\nHowever, Apple\u2019s AI push is hard to ignore. The Services business has emerged as AAPL\u2019s new cash cow with an expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade.

        "Title": "Alphabet Reportedly Canceled Its Buyout of HubSpot. Does That Make HubSpot Stock a Buy?",
        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "HubSpot (NYSE: HUBS) saw significant action in recent days as Google parent Alphabet reportedly dropped its plans to buy the company, according to a report by Bloomberg. With HubSpot set to continue as an independent entity, the stock fell by nearly 20% in the second week of July.\nNow, investors should consider whether to buy the discounted shares. Let's examine whether a position in HubSpot can pay off for its shareholders.\nAdmittedly, HubSpot's core competencies are of interest to media companies and businesses alike. HubSpot offers an inbound marketing tool for small and medium-size businesses. Rather than harassing customers with unwanted ads, HubSpot markets through content creation and information sharing.\nThis approach offers \"freemium\" content, differentiating itself from Salesforce and other customer relationship management tools. Between its free tools and paid platforms that cost as little as $20 per month, its technology is accessible to nearly any enterprise.\nAdditionally, it accomplishes many of its tasks through artificial intelligence (AI). AI helps its customers with functions such as writing emails, building customer lists, or creating reports.\nIt was likely such capabilities that initially attracted interest from a company like Alphabet. Still, according to anonymous sources, HubSpot and Alphabet had never conducted detailed discussions related to the due diligence of a potential deal.\nAlso, such a deal would have probably faced considerable regulatory scrutiny, as HubSpot's $24 billion market cap would have made it a major buyout. That factor alone reduces the odds of such a deal winning approval from regulators.\nNonetheless, the failure of such a deal may please HubSpot bulls. The stock is up more than 1,400% since its 2015 initial public offering, and despite more recent struggles, it has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last five years.\nAlso, the company continues to show robust financial growth. Revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was $617 million, a yearly increase of 23%. In comparison, revenue grew by around 25% in 2023.\nEven though it lost money in 2023, it earned a net income of $5.9 million in Q1 2024. Admittedly, the operational losses continue, and the profit came from income from investment. Nonetheless, such improvements indicate that it is close to an operational profit.\nGiven the losses in past years, it does not have a P/E ratio. However, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 10.3 places it below its all-time average sales multiple of 12 and near yearly lows. Such a valuation seems to validate that HubSpot indeed trades at a discount.\nGiven HubSpot's current state, the recent sell-off looks like a buying opportunity in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) stock. Although the deal's failure prompted many investors to sell, it is clear that HubSpot's software meets a critical need for SMBs, leading businesses to spend more on its platform.\nMoreover, its 10.3 P/S ratio takes the sales multiple close to a yearly low, allowing new investors to buy this stock at a discount. With this opportunity, investors can profit over time, and a lower price increases the likelihood it will outperform the S&P 500.\nBefore you buy stock in HubSpot, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and HubSpot wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $791,929!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) ended the recent trading session at $190.44, demonstrating a -0.02% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock's change was less than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.07%. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.13%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.14%.\nHeading into today, shares of the company had gained 7.84% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 8.61% and outpacing the S&P 500's gain of 4.34% in that time.\nThe upcoming earnings release of Alphabet Inc. will be of great interest to investors. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $1.84, indicating a 27.78% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $70.55 billion, up 13.67% from the year-ago period.\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.60 per share and revenue of $291.26 billion, which would represent changes of +31.03% and +13.55%, respectively, from the prior year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet Inc. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.01% decrease. Currently, Alphabet Inc. is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nLooking at its valuation, Alphabet Inc. is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 25.05. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 23.56.\nWe can additionally observe that GOOG currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.43. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. Internet - Services stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.13 based on yesterday's closing prices.\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 149, which puts it in the bottom 41% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Time to Buy Alphabet or IBM Stock as Earnings Approach?",
        "Author": "  Shaun Pruitt ",
        "Text": "Two tech giants highlighting this week\u2019s busy earnings lineup are Alphabet GOOGL\u00a0and International Business Machines IBM\u00a0which are set to report their Q2 results on Tuesday, July 24, and Wednesday, July 25 respectively.\nBelonging to the high-performing Magnificent Seven-themed stocks, GOOGL has soared +30% this year to edge the S&P 500 and Nasdaq while IBM\u2019s +12% has slightly trailed the broader indexes. Still, both have outperformed the broader market over the last three years.\nThat said, let\u2019s see if it\u2019s time to buy Alphabet or IBM\u2019s stock with each trading at just over $180 a share.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet Q2 Expectations\nMaking up the majority of its search engine revenue from Google, Alphabet\u2019s Advertising segment sales are thought to have increased 10% during Q2 to $64.27 billion based on Zacks estimates. Another catalyst to Alphabet\u2019s growth has been its Cloud segment revenue which is projected to soar 25% to $10.08 billion.\nOverall, Alphabet\u2019s Q2 sales are expected to increase 13% to $70.55 billion versus $62.07 billion in the comparative quarter. Furthermore, earnings are projected to climb 28% to $1.84 per share compared to EPS of $1.44 in Q2 2023.\nNotably, Alphabet has surpassed earnings expectations for five consecutive quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 11.34% in its last four quarterly reports.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIBM Q2 Expectations\nWhile Alphabet has been one of the most innovative tech companies in the modern age, IBM has begun to evolve itself as a provider of cloud and data platforms.\nKnown for its hardware and integrated computer offerings, IBM\u2019s Q2 sales are expected to be slightly up to $15.58 billion versus $15.48 billion in the prior-year quarter. However, Q2 EPS is projected to dip by roughly -1% to $2.16.\nIBM has also surpassed earnings expectations for five straight quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 5.2% in its last four quarterly reports.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nValuation Comparison \nWith their stocks edging toward $200 and trading at similar price tags, it\u2019s noteworthy that IBM has an 18.5X forward earnings multiple which is a nice discount to the S&P 500\u2019s 23.2X with GOOGL at 23.3X.\nIn terms of price to sales, IBM\u2019s P/S ratio is also more reasonable at 2.7X which is beneath the benchmark\u2019s 5.4X, and GOOGL at 7.5X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nAhead of their Q2 reports, Alphabet and IBM\u2019s stock both land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While the anticipation of Alphabet\u2019s quarterly growth certainly stands out, IBM\u2019s valuation is very attractive with both companies being sound long-term investments in the tech sector.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Are Hedge Funds Bullish on Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Right Now?",
        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Obama Stock Portfolio: 10 Year Returns. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other stocks in former U.S. president Barack Obama's portfolio.\nFormer United States President Barack Obama took office during one of the worst recessions in U.S. history, yet the stock market reached new highs during his tenure. Stepping into office in 2009, the year after stocks plummeted nearly 40% amid the financial crisis of 2007-2008, Obama made a remarkably well-timed market prediction. On March 3, 2009, just days before the S&P 500 hit an intraday low of 666 and a closing low of 676.53, the then-president stated, \"What you're now seeing is profit-and-earnings ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you've got a long-term perspective on it.\" By the time he left office on January 20, 2017, the S&P 500 had soared to 2,263.69, reflecting a gain of about 225% since his predictive remark.\nThe \"Obama Years\" coincided with rapid technological advancements that significantly impacted the stock market. Apple Inc.'s iPhone, introduced less than two years before he took office, exemplified this era of innovation. In addition, during Obama's presidency, billionaire Reed Hastings transformed Netflix Inc. from a DVD rental-by-mail company into a video-streaming giant, revolutionizing entertainment consumption. On the other hand, renewable energy, particularly solar energy, struggled during the president's tenure. Despite the administration's solar subsidies, investors were largely disappointed as those subsidies eventually faded. First Solar Inc., one of the largest U.S. solar equipment producers, saw its stock plummet by as much as 74% due to falling solar panel prices, making it the worst-performing S&P 500 stock of the Obama era.\nFrom speaking at events worldwide to writing memoirs and signing a major production deal with Netflix, the Obamas have led a busy and highly lucrative life post-White House. Michelle Obama's first memoir, \"Becoming,\" published in November 2018, became that year's No. 1 best-selling book. Her second book, \"The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times,\" also achieved bestseller status. Similarly, Barack Obama's latest memoir, \"A Promised Land,\" sold nearly 890,000 copies within 24 hours of its November 2020 release. These ventures, along with the six-figure pension that all former presidents receive, have significantly boosted the Obamas' net worth, which is at least $70 million according to the International Business Times. The New York Post, however, estimates their fortune to be much higher, at $135 million.\nOf course, Barack Obama\u2019s income isn\u2019t limited to speaking fees and pensions. Like many other wealthy individuals, he has invested significantly in the stock market. So what does his portfolio look like? When he took office in 2009, Obama, like all presidents, was required to make financial disclosures by law. At that time, Obama held $200,000-$450,000 in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares that tracks the S&P 500 index, according to a report by CBS News.\nOur Methodology\nThese investments were selected from the top holdings of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Investor Shares, one of Barack Obama's primary investments during his presidency, according to official disclosures. We have provided each stock's trailing 10-year returns to assess their performance over the decade. Data from approximately 919 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2024 was also analyzed to determine the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each firm.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple, our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy picks 14 small and large-caps every quarter and it has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNote: The stocks are sorted in ascending order of their trailing 10-year returns.\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\nTrailing 10-Year Returns: 21.05%\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), a prominent player in the technology sector, is best known for its flagship product, Google, a search engine handling billions of daily queries. The company\u2019s portfolio extends to diverse platforms for video streaming and productivity, with YouTube being a standout asset. The internet giant is also engaged in retailing electronic devices such as smartphones, ultra-thin notebooks, and speakers.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) recently showed its commitment to artificial intelligence (AI) by unveiling new AI features and products at its Google I/O developer conference on May 14. The biggest announcement from the conference is that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is set to fully incorporate AI overlays into its Google search results. Currently being rolled out, these new overlays are expected to reach 1 billion people by the end of the year.\nIn addition, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s CEO Sundar Pichai announced back in April that YouTube and Google's cloud business are projected to achieve a combined annual run rate exceeding $100 billion by the end of 2024, underscoring major revenue streams for the tech giant. YouTube reported $8.1 billion in ad sales for the first quarter ending March 31, its highest Q1 revenue to date, reflecting a 21% year-over-year increase from $6.7 billion in Q1 202\nAmong the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based investment firm Fisher Asset Management is a leading shareholder in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), holding 46.3 million shares worth more than $6.99 billion.\nOverall GOOG ranks 8th on our list of former U.S. president Barack Obama's portfolio stocks.

While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Alphabet (GOOGL) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The market expects Alphabet (GOOGL) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 23, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis internet search leader is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +28.5%.\nRevenues are expected to be $70.55 billion, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alphabet?\nFor Alphabet, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alphabet will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alphabet would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.89, delivering a surprise of +26.85%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nAlphabet doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as revealed by the latest financial data and strategic insights from the filing. The company has reported a significant increase in revenues, from $144,391 million in the first six months of 2023 to $165,281 million in the same period of 2024. Net income also saw a healthy rise from $33,419 million to $47,281 million year-over-year. These figures underscore Alphabet Inc's financial robustness and its ability to generate shareholder value amidst a dynamic market landscape.\nMarket Leadership and Brand Value: Alphabet Inc's market leadership is undisputed, with Google being synonymous with internet search. The brand's value is bolstered by its extensive product ecosystem, including Android, YouTube, and Google Cloud, which ensures a consistent user base and a diversified revenue stream. The company's ability to maintain a dominant search engine market share and its investments in AI and machine learning further solidify its competitive edge.\nFinancial Performance: Alphabet Inc's financial health is a testament to its operational excellence. The 10-Q filing reveals a substantial increase in revenues and net income, indicating efficient cost management and a successful business model. The company's strong balance sheet, with significant cash reserves, provides ample flexibility for strategic initiatives and weathering economic downturns.\nInnovation and R&D: The company's commitment to research and development is evident from its consistent investment in this area. Alphabet Inc's focus on developing new technologies, particularly in AI and cloud computing, not only enhances its existing services but also positions it to capitalize on future tech trends.\nDependence on Advertising Revenue: Despite a diversified portfolio, Alphabet Inc still relies heavily on advertising revenue, which accounted for over 85% of its total revenue. This dependence makes the company vulnerable to fluctuations in advertising spend, which can be influenced by economic cycles and changes in advertiser preferences.\nRegulatory and Legal Challenges: Alphabet Inc faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny, which could lead to significant fines, changes in business practices, or limitations on its operations. The 10-Q filing acknowledges the potential impact of legal proceedings and increased regulation on the company's financial results and business practices.\nPrivacy and Data Security: As a data-centric company, Alphabet Inc is subject to risks associated with data breaches and privacy concerns. The company must continuously invest in security measures to protect user data and maintain trust, which can be costly and affect its reputation if not managed effectively.\nExpansion into Emerging Markets: Alphabet Inc has the opportunity to expand its user base by targeting emerging markets where internet penetration is growing. Investments in infrastructure, such as Google Fiber, and localized services can drive growth in these regions.\nCloud Computing and Enterprise Services: The company's cloud computing segment shows promise, with a growing market share. Alphabet Inc's investment in cloud infrastructure and services positions it to benefit from the increasing demand for cloud solutions by businesses of all sizes.\nStrategic Acquisitions and Partnerships: Alphabet Inc's strategy of acquiring and partnering with innovative companies allows it to enter new markets and enhance its product offerings. The company's financial strength enables it to pursue such opportunities aggressively, which can lead to new revenue streams and technological advancements.\nCompetitive Pressure: Alphabet Inc operates in highly competitive markets, facing rivals like Amazon, Microsoft, and Facebook. These competitors are also investing heavily in areas such as cloud computing and AI, which could erode Alphabet Inc's market share if it does not continue to innovate and differentiate its offerings.\nRegulatory and Antitrust Issues: The company's dominant position in various markets has attracted regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the European Union. Antitrust investigations and potential regulatory changes could limit Alphabet Inc's operational flexibility and lead to significant fines or restrictions.\nTechnological Disruptions: The rapid pace of technological change poses a threat to Alphabet Inc's existing products and services. The company must stay ahead of emerging technologies and consumer trends to maintain its relevance and competitive advantage.\nIn conclusion, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) demonstrates strong financial performance and market leadership, underpinned by its innovative culture and strategic investments. However, its reliance on advertising revenue, regulatory challenges, and the fast-paced nature of the tech industry present ongoing risks. To sustain its growth trajectory, Alphabet Inc must navigate these challenges while capitalizing on opportunities in cloud computing, emerging markets, and strategic partnerships.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 23. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.85 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +28.5%.\nRevenues are expected to be $70.55 billion, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alphabet?\nFor Alphabet, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Alphabet will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alphabet would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.89, delivering a surprise of +26.85%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nAlphabet doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Google parent Alphabet decided not to pursue a takeover of online marketing software company HubSpot weeks ago, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.\nThe talks between Alphabet and HubSpot never progressed to due diligence and fell apart shortly after the companies held initial discussions on a potential deal, the source said, on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential matters.\nHubSpot's shares closed 12% lower on Wednesday, while Alphabet's shares were up 1.2%. Reuters had reported in April that Alphabet was in talks with advisers about the possibility of making an offer for HubSpot.\nA deal for HubSpot, now valued at $25 billion, would have ranked as Alphabet's biggest ever and risked scrutiny from antitrust regulators. U.S. regulators have indicated growing aversion to large technology companies getting bigger through acquisitions.\nHubSpot, which builds marketing software for small and medium-sized businesses, has specialized in so-called inbound marketing, where consumers start engagement with a brand. HubSpot customers apply its software to make advertising content that consumers can click on.\nCEO Yamini Rangan said in May on HubSpot's financial results call that customer demand had weakened, as small businesses worried about the economic impact of high interest rates.\nBloomberg reported earlier that Google is no longer in talks to acquire HubSpot.\n(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese; Editing by Shailesh Kuber, Alan Barona and Lisa Shumaker)\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Famous Analyst Says You Should Buy the Dip on These AI Stocks.\u00a0Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nGene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said in a latest interview with CNBC that the key reason behind the latest decline in tech stocks was major companies projecting high CapEx and giving no updates on AI monetization. Munster, however, thinks AI spending is necessary for these companies to reap rewards in the future. Munster referred to a latest interview of Mark Zuckerberg in which he said if his company does not keep spending on AI it may miss the biggest opportunity in the next 10-15 years. Munster said Zuckerberg believes this AI spending \u201ccannot slow down.\u201d\n\u201cI am most optimistic because that CapEX number, if you\u2019re gonna boil it down to one point, it\u2019s gonna be higher for longer and it\u2019s good for AI.\u201d\nAsked whether investors should stick with mega-cap AI stocks or move on to smaller companies that could benefit from this AI spending, Munster said that depends on to what degree you believe in the transformative power of AI.\n\u201cIf you are in my camp.. which I think it (AI) will be more transformative than the internet, then small companies and the big companies are going to participate.\u201d\nMunster thinks the AI-led bull market could last for 3-5 years before ending in what he called a \u201cspectacular bubble burst.\u201d\nFor this article we picked the AI stocks Gene Munster and his firm Deepwater Asset Management hold, according to the disclosures on CNBC.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nGene Munster in his latest interview reiterated his bullish take on Alphabet, saying the company is best positioned for AI monetization thanks to the huge \u201cdistribution\u201d advantage due to billions of users of its products.\nMunster also said recently that Alphabet is going to win the \u201cAI arms race.\u201d While talking to CNBC, the analyst said that Google search business is \u201cintact, no need to worry.\u201d Munster\u2019s thesis is based on his in-depth testing of several large language models and chatbots including Google\u2019s Gemini. Munster also thinks other chatbots do not offer a strong imperative for users to switch from Google search as of yet.\nWedbush\u2019s Dan Ives in a fresh note named Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) as one of the stocks that can benefit from the AI boom.\nAccording to a latest UBS report, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls in all three layers of the AI value chain \u2013 enabling, intelligence and application layer. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an AI enabling player because of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform, while Gemini makes it a key player in the intelligence layer.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stories.\nChina and the United States continue to compete against each other as the AI boom continues to reign in the tech industry. On July 2, Reuters reported that China plans to develop 50 new national and industrial standards for artificial intelligence by 2026. The country aims to standardize systems in the artificial intelligence sector by providing thorough guidelines to companies and budding startups. Furthermore, on July 3, Reuters reported that China filed six times more patents than the United States for inventions in AI like chatbots. On a global scale, more than 50,000 patent applications were filed in the past decade, a quarter of which were filed in 2023 alone. China filed 38,000 generative AI applications between 2014 and 2023, while the United States only filed slightly over 6,200 applications during the same period. Of the total applications, ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft filed the largest number of applications. The report added that Chinese patent applications covered a wider range of sectors such as autonomous driving, publishing, and document management. South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.\nThe United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.\nWhile the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.\nOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.\nIn another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.\nAnthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.\nClaude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.\nA lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, which was sourced from Insider Monkey's proprietary database that tracks over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Google DeepMind, the company's research lab is making moves to develop new models that will provide teams with a single access point to all the company's models. The research lab is working relentlessly to improve the Gemini experience. Back in February, the company launched Gemini 1.5\u00a0 Pro, with accelerated performance across text, audio, video, and code.\nOverall, the company's new AI models and algorithms are 100 times more efficient compared to 18 months ago. Additionally, over 60% of generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud, backed by the company's fifth-generation tensor processing unit. Additionally, more than one million developers are using its generative AI tools including AI Studio and Vertex AI. The company spent $12 billion on capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2024, twice as much as the expenditure in Q4 2023.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) also launched its NVIDIA chip rival in May. Trillium is the company's family of AI data center chips, almost five times faster than its previous models. While Google's tensor processing units (TPU) only account for almost 20% of the market, its advancements promise higher market shares in the future. The sixth generation Trillium chips perform 4.7 times better in terms of computing performance. Moreover, they are also 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of Trillium processors. The new chip will be made available to Google Cloud users by the end of 2024.\nOverall, 222 investors held stakes worth $32.35 billion\u00a0in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Of those, Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $6.99 billion.\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the stock.

GOOGL has shelved plans to acquire this customer relationship management (\u201cCRM\u201d) firm. Although spokespersons of both companies have refused to comment on the market speculation, sources familiar with the proceedings have confirmed the same.HubSpot, headquartered in Cambridge, MA, specializes in providing sales and marketing software to small and midsize businesses, leveraging digital channels such as blogs, search engines and social media. Its diversified offerings include CRM and payment services, making it an attractive asset for Alphabet. The potential deal, reported earlier in April, would have been GOOGL\u2019s largest-ever acquisition, with HubSpot reportedly valuing about $35 billion at that time.From Alphabet's perspective, acquiring HubSpot would not only have bolstered its presence in the burgeoning CRM software market but also provided a significant boost to its cloud computing business, intensifying competition with industry giants like Microsoft and Amazon. Additionally, the acquisition could have enhanced competition in the marketing and sales software sector, countering the dominance of players like Salesforce and Microsoft.For HubSpot, an acquisition by Alphabet could have offered access to greater resources and technological capabilities, enabling it to further innovate and expand its market reach.

        "Title": "This Undervalued Stock Could Join Alphabet in the $2 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Stefon Walters, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The trillion-dollar market cap club is exclusive. As it stands, there are only seven companies in the world that have passed that mark. Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia reign supreme, sitting in the illustrious $3 trillion club, but Alphabet is the lonely company in the $2 trillion club -- for now.\nWith a market cap of just over $880 billion, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u00a0(NYSE: TSM) (TSMC) still has a ways to go to reach $2 trillion, but the milestone is well within its reach. And it might not take too long, either.\nSince it became listed on the New York stock exchange in October 1997, TSMC has averaged around 13.5% annual returns. In the past decade, it's been even more impressive, averaging over 23% annual returns. A lot of that can be attributed to the 61% it's up in the past 12 months, but even much more modest returns can get TSMC into the $2 trillion club.\nIt would take just over 8.5 years to go from a $880 billion market cap to a $2 trillion market cap, averaging 10% annual returns. With TSMC's growth prospects, I believe this is doable.\nTSMC is the largest and most important semiconductor company in the world. It established the foundry model, where instead of making semiconductors for general sale, it makes semiconductors for a company's specific needs.\nThis model and the quality of TSMC's semiconductors have made it the go-to for some of the world's best companies, including Apple, Nvidia, and Tesla. Semiconductors are the foundation for many electronics and applications we use today. They're in iPhones, graphic processing units (GPUs), cars, and even medical devices.\nYou could make a strong case that without TSMC, many of these items and applications we enjoy would take a quality hit. This is why it's continued to be the top choice despite other companies like Intel embracing the same foundry model.\nFor a while, TSMC's financial performance relied on its smartphone business, and that caused it to hit a rough spot as global smartphone sales slowed down. Smartphones will continue to be an important part of TSMC's business, but it's getting help from its high-performance computing (HPC) segment, which includes artificial intelligence (AI)-related revenue.\nIn the second quarter, TSMC's revenue grew nearly 33% year over year to $20.8 billion, with HPC accounting for 52% of it. This continues a trend that's taken place over the past few quarters:\nQuarter\nPercentage of Revenue from HPU\nPercentage of Revenue From Smartphones\nQ2 2024\n52%\n33%\nQ1 2024\n46%\n38%\nQ4 2023\n43%\n43%\nData source: TSMC.\nTSMC's semiconductors are important to the GPUs that power most data centers. Without these data centers, it'd be virtually impossible to store and transport the data needed to train the AI applications that have become prominent in the past couple of years. So, it all begins with TSMC's semiconductors.\nThe success of its second quarter caused TSMC to raise its full-year revenue guidance to right above the mid-20 percentage range. It also expects its capital expenditures to be between $30 billion and $32 billion after previously estimating it to be between $28 billion to $32 billion. This potential increase in investments will help better position it to handle the increased demand cause by the AI surge.\nDespite surging over 57% this year, TSMC's stock is still valued at a reasonable level. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is around 20.5, well below the 23.7 P/E ratio it has averaged over the past five years.\nTSMC could face some geopolitical headwinds, as it potentially gets caught up in U.S.-China trade tensions and export restrictions, but these are issues TSMC's CEO has reassured won't stop the company's growth and expansion plan.\nGiven expected growth from AI demand and additional revenue that could come from a rebound in the smartphone market (especially as Apple iPhone sales are expected to rebound with the addition of Apple Intelligence in its next generation models), there's reason to think TSMC can join the $2 trillion club within the next decade.\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company is predicted to post an EPS of $1.84, indicating a 27.78% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $70.55 billion, up 13.67% from the year-ago period.\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $7.60 per share and revenue of $291.26 billion, which would represent changes of +31.03% and +13.55%, respectively, from the prior year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 23.56.\nWe can additionally observe that GOOGL currently boasts a PEG ratio of 1.42. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena ",
        "Text": "The pace of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption has only accelerated over the past year and has shuffled the ranks of some of the world's largest companies, with several household names vying for bragging rights. Microsoft currently leads the pack, having unseated Apple, each with a market cap of roughly $3.4 trillion. Nvidia's rise through the ranks has been breathtaking to behold, having nearly tripled over the past year to take the third spot at $3 trillion. Several other major purveyors of AI, namely Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms, boast valuations of between $1.3 trillion and $2.3 trillion.\nWith a market cap of just $49 billion (as of this writing), it might seem like sacrilege to propose that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, might be headed for the $1 trillion club. However, the accelerating adoption of AI has increased the need for servers capable of running and training AI systems, and the company's long track record of success makes Supermicro a clear candidate for inclusion in this elite fraternity.\nWhile Supermicro has made a splash in recent years, investors might be surprised to learn the company has been creating customized servers for more than three decades. The accelerating adoption of generative AI shone a spotlight on the under-the-radar server maker, bringing it out of the shadows.\nSupermicro's claim to fame is the company's highly customizable building-block architecture, which helps the company provide server solutions for customers of all sizes and shapes. Furthermore, Supermicro's long focus on energy efficiency has taken on greater significance as cost becomes a factor. It also offers a variety of free-air, liquid-cooling, and traditional air-cooling technologies, giving each customer just what they're looking for.\nThe company has partnerships with all the leading chipmakers, giving it access to the most in-demand AI processors. This includes strong working relationships with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel, among others.\nThis approach has served the company well. For its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), Supermicro's revenue surged 200% year over year to $3.85 billion, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $6.65 jumped 308%. Management is guiding that its triple-digit growth will continue, raising its full-year guidance to revenue of $14.9 billion and adjusted EPS of $23.69, which would represent growth of 109% and 100%, respectively.\nManagement reports that Supermicro is growing at nearly 20 times the industry average, which clearly shows the company is taking market share from the competition. Analysts at Bank of America agree, suggesting Supermicro will increase its market share from 10% last year to 17% by 2026.\nSupermicro is one of the premier names in the AI server market. The company's agility has been paramount in taking share from its rivals, as its building-block server architecture means it has something for everyone. Supermicro has also established critical partnerships with the chipmakers that supply the company with the most requested processors, giving it ample supply to meet the accelerating demand.\nDespite those advantages, it will still be some time before Supermicro ascends the ranks to become a trillionaire. According to Wall Street, Supermicro is poised to generate revenue of $14.9 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 3.3. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Supermicro would have to grow its revenue to about $305 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nIt's important to put this in context: The company is ramping up its production capabilities just to be able to generate sales of $25 billion annually, so a nearly 20-fold increase in revenue is still off in the distant future.\nIf the company were able to keep up its triple-digit year-over-year growth rate, Supermicro could reach the $1 trillion market cap by 2029. However, keeping up that frantic pace of growth for five years would be unparalleled for a well-established company. Yet, even if we cut its growth rate in half, Supermicro could hypothetically reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2032.\nWhile that might sound far-fetched, the evidence suggests it's more likely than you might think. BofA analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya posited the AI data center market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% over the coming three years, and by taking share from its rivals, Supermicro's revenue could \"grow even faster.\"\nHe's not the only one who thinks the data center upgrade cycle is about to take off. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes the installed base of data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years to support the accelerating adoption of AI.\nSo if Supermicro is successful in capturing even a small part of that fast-growing market, the path to the $1 trillion club will be paved with profits.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc: An Exploration into Its Intrinsic Value",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with AMZN.\nAs of 2024-07-22, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $204.91. It's currently trading at a price of $177.66. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 13.3%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.56\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.22%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 21.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n113.19\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n118.01\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n204.91\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $164.25. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -8.16%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\nThis company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 14.67%.\nFor the last reported quarter, Alphabet came out with earnings of $1.89 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49 per share, representing a surprise of 26.85%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.60 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.64 per share, delivering a surprise of 2.50%.\nPrice and EPS Surprise\nThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Alphabet lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nAlphabet currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.11%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on July 23, 2024.\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of the 10 Best Stock Picks of Billionaire Leon Cooperman in 2024.\u00a0Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0Leon Cooperman\u00a0predicted in April that the US is headed for a financial crisis. Cooperman said that the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero, but raised them dramatically in a period of 12 months. The \u00a0Omega Family Office chairman and CEO expects \u201cone or two\u201d rate cuts this year. He emphasized that the market remains overvalued.\nIn February last year, the billionaire said that the market was headed for a recession, and noted that the S&P 500 high of about 4,800 recorded in 2022 could \u201cstand for some time.\u201d In July 2022, while talking to\u00a0Bloomberg, Cooperman said that he was \u201cshocked\u201d that interest rates were so low.\n\u201cI am of the view that equities are the best house in the financial asset in the neighborhood, but I don\u2019t like the neighborhood, for a lot of reasons.\u201d\nCooperman in the Bloomberg interview in 2022 had categorically said that sooner or later the strong dollar, prices of oil and the Fed would \u201clead us into a recession.\u201d He went on to add that recession would be a \u201c2023 event\u201d and predicted that the market would bottom somewhere near 35% to 45% below its peak of 4800.\nThe billionaire had said that he would be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if we were to see another bull market anytime soon, given his view that we\u2019ve had one of the biggest bull runs driven by FAANG, SPACs and speculation. The AI revolution that started in 2023 was indeed a shocker for Cooperman as his recession predictions were proven wrong.\nFor this article we scanned billionaire Leon Cooperman\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 166\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) accounts for about 4% of the total Q1 portfolio of Leon Cooperman. Omega Advisors has been holding stakes in the search engine company since 2015 (except for Q2 2020 when the fund totally dumped Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), only to buy it again in the following quarter). Omega Advisors owns a $98 million stake in Alphabet Inc.

        "Author": "  David French ",
        "Text": "By David French\n(Reuters) -The S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended at multi-week lows on Wednesday, with the S&P snapping one of its longest streaks without a daily decline of more than 2%, as lackluster Alphabet and Tesla earnings undermined investor confidence in megacap names.\nAs the first of the Magnificent Seven stocks reported quarterly numbers, investors had been awaiting new data to see if lofty valuations were justified. With these seven companies having such sway over markets, their performance was bound to have wide repercussions.\nInvestor reactions to the numbers contributed to the benchmark S&P 500 posting its worst one-day performance since December 2022. Its 2.3% fall marked the first time it had closed more than 2% off in 356 sessions, its longest streak since 2007.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was also beaten down, posting its largest single-day percentage decline since October 2022 to finish at its lowest point since June 10. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed below 40,000 points for the first time in two weeks.\nDave Grecsek, managing director in investment strategy and research at Aspiriant, noted that the upward momentum of the first two weeks of July in equity markets had now disappeared over the last week.\n\"There's a little bit of profit-taking, and then people are a little apprehensive about earnings announcements upcoming,\" he said.\nTesla weighed heavily on Wednesday, slumping 12.3% in its worst single-day fall since September 2020. This came after the electric-vehicle maker reported its lowest profit margin in more than five years and missed second-quarter earnings estimates.\nGoogle parent Alphabet dropped 5%, to its worst finish since May 31, despite a second-quarter earnings beat, as investors focused on an advertising-growth slowdown and the company flagged high capital expenses for the year.\nTesla and Alphabet dragged the S&P 500 Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary sector indexes down by 3.8% and 3.9% respectively, with the Consumer Discretionary index posting its largest single-day decline since September 2022. Information Technology was the weakest performer of the 11 S&P sectors though, and its 4.1% decline was its largest daily drop since October 2022.\nAlphabet's losses underscored the high earnings bar for the so-called Magnificent Seven, a set of megacap tech stocks that have notched double- and triple-digit percentage gains in 2024, riding on optimism around AI adoption and expectations of an early start to the Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts.\n\"When you put everything in an earnings context, you can really understand why those Mag 7 stocks have been performing so great because the earnings have been there,\" said Grecsek.\nAny doubts, however, about the stocks meeting expectations will induce selling pressure. The other megacaps, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms and Nvidia, all closed down between 2.9% and 6.8%.\nMeanwhile, the blue-chip Dow did not escape the negativity. Visa was among the stocks that weighed on it, dropping 4% after its third-quarter revenue growth fell short of expectations.\nAs stocks tumbled, the Cboe Volatility Index - known as Wall Street's fear gauge - closed at 18.04, the highest since April 19.\nThe S&P 500 lost 128.61 points, or 2.31%, to 5,427.13 points, while the Nasdaq lost 654.94 points, or 3.64%, to 17,342.41. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 504.22 points, or 1.25%, to 39,853.87.\nAmong others, AT&T gained 5.2% after beating forecasts for wireless subscriber additions, while solar inverter maker Enphase Energy jumped 12.8% after reporting a second-quarter operating profit beat.\nMeanwhile, Roper Technologies dropped 7.4% after it signaled third-quarter profit would fall below estimates. Boston Scientific traded 1.1% down, despite lifting its 2024 profit target and beating second-quarter earnings estimates.\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 12.94 billion shares, compared with the 11.48-billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\n(Reporting by Ankika Biswas and Lisa Mattackal in Bengaluru and David French in New York; Editing by Varun H K, Pooja Desai and Rod Nickel)\n"

        "Text": "Tech shares led a selloff Wednesday after lackluster earnings reports from two of the market\u2019s most prominent heavyweights.\nThe Nasdaq Composite declined 3.6% and the S&P 500 fell 2.3%, both notching their worst daily percentage declines since 2022. The Dow lost 504 points, or 1.3%.\nBig Tech\u2019s decline comes after Tesla\u2019s second-quarter results released Tuesday evening showed a second-straight decline in quarterly profit and that its profits plunged more than 40% from a year ago. The electric vehicle maker faces growing competition from established automakers domestically and internationally and a slowdown in EV sales growth.\nTesla shares fell 12.3% on Wednesday. The EV-maker didn\u2019t give a new sales forecast for the year but warned that its vehicle volume growth rate this year could be substantially lower than that of 2023.\nElsewhere, Alphabet shares slid 5% after reporting a miss on expectations for YouTube advertising revenue.\n\u201cThe flight to quality of Mega Tech is becoming vulnerable to earnings that cannot have even minor disappointments,\u201d wrote Louis Navellier, chairman of Navellier & Associates, in a Wednesday note, adding that \u201cthe AI narrative isn\u2019t broken.\u201d\nWednesday\u2019s tumble extends the decline in tech stocks seen during the past week after a cool inflation report and resilient economic data led investors to bet that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September.\nWall Street has rotated out of the tech bigwigs that led stocks higher over the past year in favor of smaller stocks that have been beaten down by sky-high rates. The Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of US small-cap stocks, is up 7.6% for the month, outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 0.6% loss. Still, small-caps fell on Wednesday.\nA confluence of other factors has also battered the tech sector recently. Investors have contended with an ongoing global tech outage that has left travelers stranded at airports, consumers at risk of getting duped by cybercriminals and brought computer systems across health care and government sectors to a halt.\nThe Nasdaq last week had its worst day since 2022, after the selloff in tech was worsened by a report from Bloomberg that the Biden administration is mulling plans to impose more sanctions on Chinese tech firms and to heighten semiconductor trade restrictions between the US and China.\nAs stocks settle after the trading day, levels might change slightly.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 22, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Nvidia NVDA.\nMany in the market are looking to the two members of 'the Magnificent 7' who report quarterly results this week to help reverse the stock market's recent weakness.\nThe immediate catalyst for the stock market pullback appears to be renewed uncertainty about regulatory and trade policies following the November elections, particularly with respect to export restrictions on semiconductor players. That said, we are in a seasonally soft time of the year and should perhaps resist the temptation to read too much into the recent weakness of the Mag 7 stocks, particularly given these stocks' impressive runs already.\nTeslais in a league of its own (up +21.3% since July 1st), while Microsoft (down -2.3%) and Alphabet (down -2.2%) are roughly tracking each other.\nThis pecking order, with Tesla at the top and Amazon and Nvidia at the bottom, is completely reversed when the starting point is changed to the start of 2024 instead of the start of 2024 Q3.\nWe have Tesla and Alphabet on deck to report Q2 results this week, both reporting after the market's close on Tuesday, July 23rd.\nThe current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS for Alphabet of $1.85 has remained unchanged over the last two months, as has Tesla's Q2 EPS estimate of $0.62.\nFor Alphabet, the Q2 estimates of $1.85 per share on $70.6 billion in revenues represent year-over-year changes of +13.7% and +28.5%, respectively. Tesla's Q2 EPS estimate is -31.9% below the year-earlier period on +0.8% higher revenues.\nBoth stocks move big on the earnings release, but the EPS surprise isn't always the most important factor behind the stock's post-release reaction. Alphabet shares were up following the last quarterly release on April 25th, with the market appreciating the company's cloud results and AI outlook.\nTesla missed on the top and bottom-lines in the April 23rd quarterly release, but the stock was up following the numbers as the market liked the company's performance on the deliveries front. In fact, Tesla shares have been on a steady uptrend since the April 23rd release, reversing the persistent underperformance of the preceding period.\nThe other Mag 7 players will report the following week, with Nvidia being the last one to release quarterly results on August 28th.\nThe group is expected to bring in +25.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.3% higher revenues.\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. The group returned to the 'regular/normal' growth model last year, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +15.5% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues.\nAs with the Mag 7, the Tech sector dealt with the pulled-forward revenues but is expected to remain firmly in growth mode.\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trend. The current +17.2% earnings growth expected for the group is up from +14.2% three months ago. Estimates for next year have also gone up.\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, July 19th, we have seen Q2 results from 71 S&P 500 members, or 14.2% of the index's membership. Total earnings for these 71 index members are up +8.7% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 83.1% beating EPS estimates and only 53.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\nThe Q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week, with more than 500 companies on deck to report results, including 135 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Alphabet and Tesla, this week's line-up includes a representative cross-section of reports from different sectors, including bellwethers like Verizon and AT&T, UPS, Coke, GM and Ford, Spotify, IBM, Chipotle, and others.\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, 53.5% is a new low for this group of 71 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues. This will be the highest quarterly growth pace since the +10% earnings growth rate in the 2022 Q1 period.\nAs we have been flagging all along in this space, we experienced a notably favorable revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season, with estimates for Q2 holding up far better than other recent periods. In the three-month period from the start of the quarter through June 30th, Q2 estimates for the S&P 500 index fell the least relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.\nNot only is the Q2 earnings growth the highest since the first quarter of 2022, but the absolute level of aggregate earnings for the period is also on track to be a new all-time quarterly record.\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.8% on +1.6% revenue growth.\nThe expected revenue growth pace improves to +3.9% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +8.7% on an ex-Finance basis.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q2 Earnings Season Starts Positively\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

The Master Account of the fund returned -2.7% net in the second quarter compared to 4.3% for the S&P500 Index.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, offers various platforms and services operating through Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. The one-month return of Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stock closed at $192.66 per share with a market capitalization of $2.371 trillion.\nAlphyn Capital Management stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) continues to perform strongly, with 16% revenue growth, with particular strength in search (14%), YouTube ads (21%), and Cloud (28%) and near-record operating margins of 31.6%. Viewed just a few months ago as a vulnerable incumbent facing stiff competition from OpenAI and others, sentiment around Alphabet\u2019s competitiveness in GenAI has turned more positive. Previously, some worried that Large Language Models (LLMs) could bypass traditional search results, potentially impacting ad revenue from third-party publishers. However, Alphabet has started incorporating \u201cAI Overviews\u201d in searches featuring responses from its LLM and Gemini. It reports improved user satisfaction and click-through rates exceeding those of traditional web listings. Alphabet believes AI will expand its search monetization and is exploring new features like short product videos, virtual try on options, and 3D product views within shopping ads. It has also rolled out AI tools for advertisers, such as enhanced image creation and improved measurement, to refine the advertising experience further. Alphabet benefits from a strong competitive moat due to its vast infrastructure, including data centers, custom chips, and leading LLMs like Gemini. This infrastructure allows them to seamlessly integrate AI across their products, reaching billions of users. However, their projected capital expenditure of $50 billion this year, primarily for tech infrastructure, is worth monitoring. While financially manageable, it signifies a shift from Alphabet's capital-light past to a more capital-intensive approach in the AI era.\"\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nAlphabet Inc.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) came out with quarterly earnings of $1.89 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.44 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 2.16%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.89, delivering a surprise of 26.85%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\nAlphabet , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry, posted revenues of $71.36 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.07%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $62.07 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nAlphabet shares have added about 30.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 16.7%.\nWhat's Next for Alphabet?\nWhile Alphabet has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Alphabet: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.82 on $72.15 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.62 on $291.25 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Services is currently in the top 36% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\nOne other stock from the same industry, Akamai Technologies (AKAM), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 8.\nThis cloud services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.54 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.4%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nAkamai Technologies' revenues are expected to be $976.44 million, up 4.4% from the year-ago quarter.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Better Cloud Computing Stock: Alphabet vs. Super Micro Computer",
        "Author": "  Robert Izquierdo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The arrival of artificial intelligence into the mainstream is a boon for the cloud computing industry. AI needs enormous amounts of data and computing power to execute tasks, both of which are readily available in a cloud environment.\nTwo prominent businesses benefiting from AI and its impact on the cloud computing market are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), commonly known as Supermicro.\nHere's how these two tech companies are reaping the rewards from the AI-driven cloud computing boom, and if you had to choose just one to invest in, which might prove the better long-term investment.\nAlphabet is perhaps best known for its ubiquitous Google search engine. But it also has a thriving cloud computing business called Google Cloud.\nThis division is experiencing rapid growth. In the first quarter, Google Cloud generated $9.6 billion, which is a 28% increase from 2023's $7.5 billion. It is now the third-largest cloud vendor in the world.\nGoogle Cloud offers several benefits to its business clients. Like all cloud offerings, customers can use it to augment or replace existing IT infrastructure, such as servers.\nMoreover, Alphabet makes its proprietary AI platform available to clients through Google Cloud, so they can create their own AI systems and apps. Instacart uses this feature to improve its customer service workflows.\nIn addition, according to CEO Sundar Pichai, \"Our Cloud business is now widely seen as the leader in cybersecurity.\" Its AI-powered cybersecurity features are why Pfizer adopted Google Cloud.\nSupermicro provides computer servers and storage solutions, the exact components critical to cloud computing. It focuses on high-performance computing products to cater to the needs of AI-optimized clouds in particular.\nSupermicro offers customers an array of options using a modular approach the company calls its \"Building Block Architecture.\" This approach allows it to quickly customize products to meet the technical requirements of its clientele.\nThe sudden AI-spurred demand for Supermicro's offerings led to massive sales growth for the company. In its fiscal Q3, ended March 31, Supermicro achieved revenue of $3.9 billion, a 200% increase year over year.\nThe company expects its outsized sales to continue. Supermicro is forecasting revenue of at least $5.1 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter. That's more than double the $2.2 billion in Q4 sales generated in the previous fiscal year.\nSupermicro added to its ability to grow revenue through an expanded product line. Its offerings now encompass additional IT infrastructure needs, such as power and liquid cooling systems.\nThe cloud computing market is expected to see multiyear growth thanks to AI, rising from $588 billion last year to $2.3 trillion by 2032. This growth makes both Alphabet and Supermicro compelling investments for the long term.\nHowever, deciding which stock is the better buy can be challenging. In this duel of cloud companies, several factors favor Alphabet.\nThe Google parent offers a more diversified business. It has a thriving digital advertising operation, where it's a market leader. Ad sales comprised $61.7 billion of the company's $80.5 billion in Q1 revenue.\nAlphabet is also a market leader in online search. Thanks to Google's popularity, Alphabet has a trove of data to feed into and strengthen its AI platform.\nAlso, Supermicro battles in a competitive space with rivals including Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.\nCompetition has led to pricing pressure, causing a decline in Supermicro's gross margin to 15.6% in fiscal Q3 from 17.7% in the prior year. Supermicro expects its gross margin to decline further in fiscal Q4.\nAnother factor to consider is valuation. Using the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), a widely used metric to assess a stock's value, Alphabet is the winner. This chart shows that Supermicro's valuation has soared in 2024.\nWhile Supermicro's P/E ratio has come down in recent months, shares remain pricier than Alphabet's.\nIn addition, Supermicro is not cash-flow positive. It spent $2.7 billion over the past three quarters building up its product inventory. This resulted in negative free cash flow (FCF) of $1.6 billion in fiscal Q3.\nAlphabet isn't burdened with maintaining an inventory of goods to sell, helping it to generate prodigious FCF of $16.8 billion in Q1. Over the trailing 12 months, the company's FCF was $69.1 billion.\nIts tremendous FCF allows Alphabet to comfortably afford a dividend. Supermicro doesn't offer a dividend.\nWhile both companies are enjoying rising revenue thanks to growth in the cloud computing sector, given Alphabet's market-leading products, strong FCF, more diversified business, and better stock valuation, Alphabet is the superior investment at this time.\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Super Micro Computer wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 5, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, and Nvidia NVDA.\nUS stock indexes have staged yet another bullish breakout. The economy is steady, employment is robust, inflation continues to fall, and stocks are making record highs \u2013 if you aren\u2019t bullish now, I don\u2019t know what else to tell you.\nLife can be very easy in this market, as some of the largest and most prevalent companies in the world are still trading at appealing levels.\nThe 'Magnificent 7' continues to grow earnings at an incredible pace, while the stocks also show encouraging momentum. Q2 earnings for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 companies are expected to be up +25.5% from the same period last year on +13.1% higher revenues, while the stock prices on several of them push YTD highs.\nMy favorite names from the Mag 7 currently are Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet. Also, Nvidia, gets an honorable mention because it too is still a fantastic stock with a top Zacks Rank.\nIn the chart below we can see that each of these stocks is showing significant relative strength against the broad market. Apple, although it trails the market YTD, shows the most significant short-term momentum, up 30% in just the last three months.\nApple, a consistently successful company with a strong stock performance, is one whose earnings trends I closely monitor. However, over the past two years, earnings revisions have been flat, and while it remains a decent performer, it hasn't delivered any exceptional growth.\nNotably, Apple\u2019s earnings revision trend has begun to turn higher for the first time in a while. This is extremely encouraging action, and Apple now enjoys a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\nAmazon too has seen its earnings revision trend turn higher, giving it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating as well.\nApple, Amazon, and Alphabet all have massive tailwinds coming from the AI boom. We learned about Apple\u2019s new AI software integrations, as well as Alphabets new AI agents over the last couple of months, but there are numerous other ways the technology is being used behind the scenes as well.\nAt Amazon, its web services business is going to be a huge beneficiary as technology companies ramp up computing power. But AI will also be used at its fulfillment operations, as the massive scale benefits from optimizations. Amazon is also quietly one of the biggest users of new robotics tech, as its operations continue to be automated.\nBased on these developments it\u2019s no surprise we are beginning to see analysts raise earnings estimates.\nAlthough Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting a flat earnings revision trend, it still has a lot going for it. It is currently the relatively cheapest stock in the group.\nToday, it has a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.4x, which is just above the market average, and below its 10-year median of 26.1x. GOOGL is also expected to grow its EPS 17.5% annually over the next 3-5 years, plans to buy back some $70 billion in shares this year, and is now paying a tidy 0.43% dividend.\nAmazon too is trading at a deep historical discount. At 43x forward earnings it is well below its 10-year median of 98.2x, and EPS is forecast to grow 29.6% annually over the next 3-5 years.\nAt 33.4x, Apple is the only one trading above its historical median valuation, but for a company of its quality it is no surprise it earns a premium valuation.\nThis bull market continues to charge, fueled by a robust economy, falling inflation, and stellar earnings growth from industry leaders. The \"Magnificent 7\" stands out with their impressive earnings and momentum, offering attractive entry points for investors seeking exposure to top performers.\nMoreover, the growing adoption of AI across these companies, particularly in areas like automation and cloud computing, positions them for long-term dominance in the evolving technological landscape. With valuations remaining reasonable and fundamental strength unwavering, this market rally appears poised to extend its winning streak.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are having a dramatic impact on the technology landscape, which is evident in the market value of some of the world's most technologically advanced businesses. What many of these companies have in common is that they're trailblazers in AI.\nApple is currently the leader (as of this writing), with Microsoft currently at No. 2, with market caps of $3.4 trillion and $3.3 trillion, respectively. Nvidia's ascent has been breathtaking, adding nearly $2 trillion in value over the past year and climbing to $2.9 trillion to take the No. 3 spot. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- all at the forefront of the AI revolution -- boast market caps of $2.2 trillion, $1.9 trillion, and $1.2 trillion, respectively.\nWith a market cap of just $387 billion, it might seem like a longshot to suggest that Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) might be in the running for membership in the $1 trillion club. However, an examination of the company's recent results and commentary from management suggests the adoption of generative AI could push the company to new heights over the next few years.\nOracle is in an enviable place in the AI revolution. It offers cloud, database, and enterprise-software solutions that are relied upon by 98% of the global Fortune 500 companies. Oracle's information technology (IT) expertise makes it one of the go-to sources for enterprises looking to adopt generative AI solutions.\nThis has helped fuel solid overall growth. During Oracle's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended May 31), revenue of $14.3 billion grew 3% year over year, while operating income jumped 15% -- but that doesn't tell the whole story.\nDuring the Q4 earnings call, Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison noted that the company had inked more than 30 AI-centric contracts worth more than $12 billion in the most recent quarter alone. This included some of the largest contracts in Oracle's history. Ellison said he expects robust demand for generative AI to \"turbocharge\" the company's cloud database growth.\nThis, in turn, pushed the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contracts not yet recognized as revenue -- to $98 billion, up 44% year over year. When RPO is growing faster than revenue, this suggests sales growth is accelerating. This helps to illustrate that Oracle is capitalizing on the growing demand for AI among its sizable customer base.\nOracle's long track record of cloud and AI experience has many new and existing enterprise clients jumping on the generative AI bandwagon, looking to benefit from the increased productivity resulting from AI adoption. That said, fortune favors the patient, as this process will take some time to come to fruition.\nAccording to Wall Street, Oracle is expected to generate revenue of $57.9 billion in its fiscal 2025 (which began June 1), giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 7. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Oracle would need to grow its revenue to approximately $148 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nRevenue grew by 11% year over year in the most recent quarter and is expected to accelerate to 15% for the fiscal year. If the company achieves 11% sales growth, Oracle could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2034. However, if the company can maintain a growth rate of 15%, it would knock a couple of years off that timeline, reaching a $1 trillion market cap by 2032.\nThat said, estimates regarding the impact of generative AI adoption continue to ratchet higher. Conservative estimates suggest the market could grow to between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\nIf Oracle continues to successfully tap into this AI opportunity and proceeds along its current growth trajectory, the company could achieve a $1 trillion market cap sooner than many expect.\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Tuesday, July 23rd, 2024Markets Tuesday behaved reminiscent to a week ago or so. While three of the four major indices hung pretty close to zero-balance and dipped into the red shortly before the closing bell, the small-cap Russell 2000 swooped past the field shortly after the open and remained above it all session. The Dow lost -57 points, -0.14%, while the Nasdaq was -10 points, -0.06%, and the S&P 500 -0.16%. The Russell gained +1.23% and is +10% over the past month of trading.As Q2 earnings begins to elbow out other new events, we take one exception here. This morning, Existing Home Sales for June made the case for the housing industry, but didn\u2019t particularly make it well. A total of 3.89 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units for the month was below the estimated 3.95 million and the unrevised 4.11 million for May. This is the fourth-straight month of lower existing home sales and the lowest of the year as the median price rose to a record-high $426,900. Tomorrow we\u2019ll see New Home Sales, which are expected to be up month over month, taking up a higher percentage of housing demand.Tesla TSLA disappointed on Q2 earnings this afternoon. Coming out at 52 cents per share was a dime lower than the consensus estimate, while revenues slightly outperformed expectations: $25.50 billion from $25.13 billion. In the press release, the company warned full-year deliveries may be \u201cnotably lower,\u201d with more color expected on the conference call an hour from now. A lower-priced Tesla model and the Robotaxi status are two elements Tesla shareholders will also expect to hear more about. At this hour, TSLA shares are -2.5%.Google parent Alphabet GOOGL, on the other hand, beat on both top and bottom lines after the close. Earnings of $1.89 per share notched a four-cent beat (and notably ahead of the $1.44 per share reported in the year-ago quarter) on revenues \u2014 minus TAC costs, which the company doesn\u2019t discount on headline \u2014 of $71.36 billion, ahead of the $70.60 billion in the Zacks consensus. YouTube brought in $8.66 billion, which was light of estimates, but its cloud business came in at $10.35 billion, surpassing expectations \u2014 and improving its status among the very biggest cloud-computing companies. Shares were sluggish to start after-hours trading, but are up +1.5% at this hour.Seagate Technologies STX had perhaps the most impressive quarter post-closing bell. Its fiscal Q4 earnings came in at $1.05 per share \u2014 20 cents higher than the Zacks consensus and a whopping +680% over the -$0.18 per share posted a year ago for the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)-rated cloud and AI tech firm. Revenues of $1.89 billion outpaced the $1.86 billion expected, and marks the third-straight earnings beat for the company, which is up +6.4% in late trading, adding to the +27% gains year to date.Texas Instruments TXN also outperformed in the quarter, but not as substantially. Earnings of $1.22 per share amounted to a six-cent beat \u2014 consistent with its near-perfect record of (slight) improvements over estimates in the past five years. Revenues came in at $3.82 billion, modestly beyond the $3.80 billion analysts had been looking for. The analog-chip giant kept its next-quarter guidance in-line with recent estimates, and shares are up +5% on the news.Visa V posted a one-penny beat in its fiscal Q3 this afternoon. Earnings of $2.42 per share was notably ahead of the $2.16 per share reported a year ago. But revenues were a smidge below expectations to $8.9 billion for the quarter, on Payments Volume which grew +7% in the quarter. Shares are down -2% in the late session, virtually giving up the credit card giant\u2019s entire year-to-date gains.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

Users can select multiple conversations, select profile avatars and share individually by tapping the \"Next\" FAB.Alphabet aims to enhance the user experience of the Google Messages app, thereby increasing its adoption among Android users on the back of its latest UI redesign.Moreover, it will enable Google to capitalize on solid growth opportunities present in the global mobile messaging market, which, per a Future Market Insights report, is expected to reach $443.53 billion by 2033, indicating a CAGR of 15.9% between 2023 and 2033.\nAlphabet\u2019s shares have rallied 30.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 24.9%. The company is benefiting from strength in the Google Services segment.The latest move to boost Google\u2019s messaging app bodes well for the company\u2019s increasing efforts to strengthen its Android offerings, which play a vital role in driving the prospects of the Google Services segment.Google recently introduced a new Notifications feature for one of its Android apps, Google Wallet. The Wallet app now has six notification categories, namely, Tips, Purchases, Passes, Transit, Updates & Alerts, and Promotional Campaigns, allowing users to receive transaction notifications from Google Wallet directly instead of Google Play services.It also expanded its YouTube Create video editing app for Android to 13 more countries, including Australia, Brazil, Spain and the United States.Strengthening the Google Services segment on the back of growing Android capabilities will, in turn, likely aid the overall financial performance of the company in the near term.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $291.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.6%.The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure has been revised upward by 0.4% in the past 60 days.\nStrengthening Android operating system is continuously aiding Alphabet in sustaining its dominance in the global smartphone market against its rival Apple AAPL, which is also gaining solid momentum across its mobile operating system, iOS, which has a loyal customer base.Per a Statista report, Android maintained its position as the leading mobile operating system worldwide in the first quarter of 2024, with a market share of 70.7%, whereas Apple's iOS had a market share of 28.5% during the same period.\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Garmin GRMN and Badger Meter BMI, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 30, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL.\nGet ready for some action this week in the stock market as four of the Magnificent 7 tech giants \u2014 Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple \u2014gear up to report their quarterly earnings.\nThese tech titans have been the primary drivers of this year\u2019s return, pushing the market to new heights. But with the recent bout of market volatility, the big question remains: Is now the time for investors to dive into tech stocks?\nHere, we will explore the broader picture of the sector and potential outcomes of these quarterly earnings reports and try to figure out if any or all of them are worthy additions to investor portfolios at current levels.\nLast week, following the quarterly report from Alphabet, investors started to grow cautious. Concerns about overinvestment into AI infrastructure and its ability to generate profits moving forward have been the main cause of selling over the last week.\nManagement\u2019s comments about Capex regarding AI will be an important talking point for all these stocks.\nAlong with weakness in Alphabet, Semiconductor stocks and the other Mag 7 stocks have experienced considerable selling. But are these concerns overblown? I think they may be, and with another quarter of impressive growth likely coming, and reasonable valuations from the group, this dip could be a buying opportunity.\nAmazon is expected to post a 63.64% year-over-year increase in earnings to $0.54 per share, with revenue projected at $140.88 billion, driven by robust AWS and North American retail operations. Apple, despite a slight revenue dip to $81.64 billion, is forecasted to achieve earnings of $1.19 per share, bolstered by its services and wearables segments.\nMeta Platforms anticipates a significant earnings jump to $3.04 per share, a 45% jump and $31.05 billion in revenue, fueled by strong ad revenue and user engagement. Microsoft is projected to deliver $2.72 per share in earnings and $62.03 billion in revenue, reflecting Azure's impressive performance and continued strength in Office and LinkedIn.\nOverall, the Mag 7 is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\nLooking at the valuations of these tech giants we see a spectrum of results. Although they are broadly trading at reasonable levels, two of them look much more appealing than the others.\nMeta Platforms stands out with a free cash flow (FCF) yield of 4.1%, above its 10-year median of 3.2%, making it particularly attractive. Amazon too boasts an FCF yield of 2.6%, above its 10-year median of 1.8%.\nApple, on the other hand, has a FCF yield of 3%, which is below its 10-year median of 5.7%, indicating it may be pricier relative to its historical norm. And Microsoft shows a similar trend with an FCF yield of 2.2%, below its 10-year median of 3.6%.\nI think it may be a bit of a crapshoot buying these names ahead of earnings, but the reasonable valuations and secular tailwinds these companies enjoy make them compelling buys if they sell off further following the reports.\nCritical to the performance of these stocks through the end of the year is investors' perception of AI. Can these companies turn a profit in their new AI products? The answer is probably yes, but shareholders want to see hard evidence.\nAnother worthy consideration is the setup in the broader market and the approaching US Presidential Election. Big tech has been carrying the market higher all year, and it may be time for a pause in this run. Additionally, as the election approaches so does the perceived uncertainty, and investors may rotate into defensive sectors until after it concludes.\nHowever, it is hard to understate the long-term growth catalysts at these big tech companies \u2013 they are almost all expected to grow earnings faster than the market, which will drive even higher stock prices in the coming years.\nAny pause they take now, or in the coming months, is likely an opportunity to acquire shares in these generational assets.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Implied Volatility Surging for Alphabet (GOOGL) Stock Options",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Investors in Alphabet Inc. GOOGL need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Aug 16, 2024 $30.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Alphabet shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Alphabet is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Internet - Services industry that ranks in the Top 40% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, six analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while seven have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.82 per share to $1.83 in that period.\nGiven the way analysts feel about Alphabet right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there\u2019s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.\nClick to see the trades now >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
