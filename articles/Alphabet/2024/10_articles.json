        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google, is getting absolutely no love from the public markets right now. In fact, from a valuation standpoint, it's actually cheaper than the broader market, measured by the S&P 500.\nThat's an odd statement, considering that Alphabet is one of the most dominant tech companies on the market today. There's a reason for some pessimism with the stock, but is it enough to price it at a discount compared to the S&P 500?\nAlphabet's stock has been fairly cheap throughout 2024, although its current state is about the cheapest it has been.\nOn a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis, Alphabet is cheaper than the S&P 500, regardless of whether you look at trailing earnings or forward earnings. The S&P 500 currently trades for 24.7 times trailing earnings and 23.8 times forward earnings.\nEssentially, the market is saying that Alphabet deserves a lower premium than the average S&P 500 constituent, which is an incredible statement.\nGranted, Alphabet hasn't put itself in the best place, either. The Department of Justice indicated that it could seek to break up the company after Alphabet was found guilty of monopolistic practices. This frightened many investors, as they don't know how Alphabet would be broken up if it was forced to split up. However, this is years away, as Alphabet will challenge every part of this in court. Furthermore, when other companies are split up or divest a portion, the split often unlocks value, making the sum of the parts greater than the whole.\nAlthough the DOJ case is one to watch, I don't think it should factor into an investor's decision to buy the stock.\nAnother reason Alphabet is being doubted is that some are worried the new search engines powered by generative AI could knock Alphabet from its pedestal atop the internet search market. I think there is a very low probability of this happening, as Alphabet's incredible market share (about 90%) means that a large number of people would have to change their habits. Google already added a generative AI-powered summary to the top of its search result, so in some ways, it's already evolved its platform before others could even try to usurp it.\nThere are many pessimistic headlines surrounding Alphabet, which led to its stock becoming so cheap. However, what remains is a company that's still doing quite well and worth investing in now. Its cheap stock price allows both investors and the company itself to get a great deal on the stock.\nBecause Alphabet is on the DOJ's radar, any acquisitions it wants to make are highly scrutinized. So, instead of using its cash pile to buy up other complementary companies, it buys back stock.\nSimilar to how an investor's money can buy more shares of a company with a cheap stock price, a company's buybacks have the same effect. Last quarter, Alphabet bought back $15 billion worth of shares, which reduced the share count by 2.6% year over year.\nAlphabet's share repurchases will have a strong effect over a long time period and further amplify its earnings per share (EPS) growth. Because they reduce the denominator of this metric, they increase the output of the equation. Along with strong revenue growth (14% year over year), improved efficiencies, and share buybacks, Alphabet's EPS increased from $1.44 to $1.89 year over year in the second quarter -- a 31% rise.\nSince stock price movements are highly correlated to earnings growth over the long term, Alphabet is poised to stomp the market in the future if it can keep delivering EPS growth like that. With it already trading at a discount to the broader market, it's about as no-brainer a buy as you can get right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Is A Goldman Sachs Phase 2 AI Stock For The Next AI Wave",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. In this piece, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks among the list of Goldman Sachs' Phase 2 AI stocks.\nWhile consumer technology stocks had soared in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, back then, their share price gains were due to. the growing demand for technology products and services due to lock downs. Now, big technology stocks have persisted in their strong performance despite high interest rates since they have been judged by the market as the top innovators and performers in the artificial intelligence industry.\nSince AI is somewhat of a ubiquitous technology, its impact is on several industries. So far, we\u2019ve seen most of the stock market returns related to AI directly tied to just one stock. This stock continued to be the fifth most trending AI stocks as recently as in mid October and its share price returns are nothing short of unbelievable. From its bottom in October 2022 when the split adjusted share price was a mere $11.23, the shares have gained a stunning 1,100%. In other words, if you had invested just $100 back then in the shares and then held onto them for dear life, your investment would be worth $1,200 today.\nThis is the magic of AI, a technology that has caught Wall Street and retail investors alike by storm. However, AI\u2019s impact, and its enablement, aren\u2019t limited to the GPU designer we\u2019ve mentioned above. While GPUs are the \u2018oil\u2019 for this technology, a wide variety of other components from data center infrastructure, networking equipment, connectivity, and energy all will have to play their part if OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s plans of initially building as many as 7 AI data centers across the US, with each data center guzzling an unbelievable 5 Gigawatts of electricity, are to come to fruition.\nThis then makes us ask, what are such stocks that might enable 35 Gigawatts of AI data centers across the US? After all, in order to meet the world\u2019s demand for AI chips, Altman believes that an unfathomable $7 trillion will need to be spent for building 36 chip manufacturing fabs and additional AI data centers. This money has to be spent somewhere, and therein lies the answer to our question. Things get clearer when we look at a detailed research report from investment bank Goldman Sachs. This report segregated the AI sector into four categories.\nThe first category only included Wall Street\u2019s AI darling, the second was made of AI capacity providers like server companies, other semiconductor firms, and utilities, the third included firms that sell AI products and software, and the fourth category firms were those that will benefit from AI adoption. In its report, the investment bank shared that year to date in July, the first category had returned 139%. As of mid October, this category has gained 179% on the stock market, so safe to say returns have accelerated despite some turbulence in between. By July, the second group of firms was also doing well. Its returns ranged between ~-8% to ~50%, with the average stock having delivered 22%.\nZooming into these firms, the utility sector is one which had particularly impressed the bank. It shared that utilities were the best performing sector in the flagship S&P index between March and May courtesy of their 16% returns. Their three month returns ranked in the 98th percentile since 2022 and were the third highest after 2003 and 2020 rallies. This outperformance is unsurprising given the strong investments in data centers that have taken the US by storm this year.\nThese investments have led to estimates suggesting that America\u2019s data center hub, Northern Virginia, will require 11,000 megawatts of electricity by 2035 \u2013 demand which has already spurred $5.2 billion in investments for transmission lines and coal fired power plants. Estimates from Boston Consulting Group believe that by 2030, AI will account for 16% of America\u2019s energy consumption and touch 130 gigawatts. For a detailed look at the link between electricity use and data centers, you should read 15 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Jefferies, Citi and Wall Street Analysts.\nThe bustling optimism surrounding AI is also reflected in revenue estimates. Goldman\u2019s September 2024 research shows that 2025 revenue estimates of semiconductor firms, software enablers, and hardware firms except semiconductors are roughly 2.3x, 2.05x, and 1.8x over 2019 levels, respectively. Similarly, non semiconductor hardware companies have seen their revenue forecasts for Q4 2025 jump to $450 billion for a $380 billion gain over Q1 2024\u2019s $70 billion. Makes us wonder whether it\u2019s this group of companies that might see a stock mirror the 1,100% returns of Wall Street\u2019s AI darling.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 best phase 2 AI stocks, we ranked the 20 stocks with the highest year to date returns and some other big tech and data center names that have announced multi billion dollars in capital expenditure by their year to date performance.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA close up of a confident investor making a decisive transaction in the stock market.\nYear To Date Share Price Gain: 17.88%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the mega cap technology company that earns most of its revenue through its search engine, Google Search. Its dominance in the global search industry, which sees it operate across all ends from serving as a marketplace for ads to running the ads on its platforms, has enabled Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) to build a fortress balance sheet. Its cash and equivalents sit at $111 billion which enables the firm to play a leading role in the cloud computing industry. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a diversified AI company, since not only does it offer AI products and services along with the Gemini APU, but it also offers tensor processing unit (TPU) chips to others to run their AI workloads. One of its biggest TPU customers is Apple, and its AI platform means that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is both an AI enabler and an AI beneficiary.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 23rd on our list of Goldman Sachs' top phase 2 AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the\u00a010 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.\nVolatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market.\nA report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds\u00a0and\u00a0David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy.\nWhile expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells.\nThe economist maintains we are marching on ice that\u2019s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.\u201d\n\u201cBut there\u2019s been some cracks in the business cycle,\u201d he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at \u201csuper high\u201d levels.\nA slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election.\nWhile the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around.\n\u201cHistorically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,\u201d Cohen said.\nAlthough there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows.\nAI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta\u2019s share price surge due to strong sales growth.\nAnalysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst\u2019s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 216\nAnalyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 26%\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s wide range of internet-related services and goods allows it to maintain its dominance in the digital market. One of the main factors contributing to Alphabet\u2019s success has been the incorporation of AI throughout its product line.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technologies are improving user engagement and advertising efficiency, from YouTube content recommendations to search algorithms. Despite competition from new chatbot technologies, Alphabet has maintained its market leadership in search thanks to this technological advantage, with reports showing an increase in market share.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s 2024 second-quarter results were outstanding, exceeding revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts. AI-driven advancements that improved ad performance and marketer return on ad spend (ROAS) drove the company\u2019s core search business to show strong growth. Due to the increased demand for AI-related services, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) also demonstrated accelerated growth, surpassing the expansion of the entire cloud segment.\nWith a substantial revenue of $328.28 billion over the past 12 months, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has demonstrated an impressive 13.38% growth in revenue. The analyst\u2019s assessment that search growth projections may have been underestimated is supported by this growth trajectory.\nBecause it is expanding, the digital advertising market is a desirable area to invest in. Digital advertising spending is anticipated to rise by 12% annually in 2024 and maintain double-digit growth through at least 2026.\nConsequently, Google\u2019s ad revenue increased from $42.6 billion in 2023 to $48.5 billion in the second quarter. Almost 60% of Alphabet\u2019s $84.7 billion in Q2 sales came from this. Alphabet gets its ad revenue from sources other than Google. YouTube, the world\u2019s second-largest website after Google, is also owned by the conglomerate. In Q2, YouTube\u2019s ad sales brought in $8.7 billion for Alphabet, up from $7.7 billion the year before.\nThe robust revenue and earnings growth due to AI integration to enhance advertising is one reason the company is rated as a buy with an average price target of $206.60, implying a 26.87% change from the last price of $162.84.\nOverall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). According to the Insider Monkey database,\u00a0Fisher Asset Management\u00a0was the highest stakeholder, with a position of $8.86 billion.\nOverall GOOGL\u00a0ranks 7th\u00a0on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Abhirup Roy ",
        "Text": "By Abhirup Roy\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet's Waymo will add electric vehicles from South Korea's Hyundai Motor to its robotaxi fleet, the companies said on Friday, as Waymo expands in the United States.\nOn-road testing for IONIQ 5 SUVs - assembled at Hyundai's Georgia facility and equipped with Waymo's autonomous technology - will begin by late 2025, they said.\nWaymo has about 700 vehicles in its fleet and is the only U.S. firm operating uncrewed robotaxis that collect fares.\nThe partnership with Hyundai comes days before Tesla CEO Elon Musk is set to unveil plans for a robotaxi product that is expected to use a custom-built vehicle. Musk may also discuss plans for his company to run a ride-hailing platform that will allow Tesla owners to list their vehicles when not in use.\nWaymo now uses I-PACE vehicles from Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India's Tata Motors. Waymo is also testing its technology using vehicles from Zeekr, the EV brand of China's Geely. A spokesperson for Waymo said the Hyundai partnership will not directly replace any of its current vehicle platforms.\nThis year, Waymo opened its service to everyone in San Francisco, without the need to join a waitlist, while expanding its operations in metro Phoenix. It also extended services to the San Francisco Peninsula and to certain parts of Los Angeles.\n\"The team at our new manufacturing facility is ready to allocate a significant number of vehicles for the Waymo One fleet as it continues to expand,\" Jose Munoz, global COO of Hyundai Motor said in a statement. \"We are actively exploring additional opportunities for collaboration.\"\nDespite widespread skepticism, tight regulatory scrutiny and federal investigations on AV technology, Alphabet said this year it was planning a multi-year $5 billion investment in Waymo.\nIn August, Waymo said it had doubled its paid rides to 100,000 per week in just over three months as it expanded its areas of service and allowed more people to ride its robotaxis.\nOthers in the race include General Motors' Cruise, which is testing cars with human safety drivers after an accident last year led it to pull all vehicles from the road, and Amazon's Zoox, which is expanding testing for its vehicles built without steering wheels and pedals.\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Peter Henderson and Jacqueline Wong)\n"

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this company have returned +0.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.8% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share, indicating a change of +18.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.64 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.7%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $72.79 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $292.23 billion and $325.87 billion estimates indicate +13.9% and +11.5% changes, respectively.\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Amazon and Alphabet: Pivotal Chooses the Best \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 Stocks to Buy",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "The NASDAQ index has risen 24% year-to-date and is hovering near record highs following a summer lull. Once again, the rally has been powered largely by the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 \u2013 a select group of mega-cap tech stocks that have soared to stratospheric valuations in recent years.\nThis group includes the six largest stocks trading on Wall Street \u2013 Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta \u2013 as well as Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla. Together, these companies have been leaders in innovation, especially of the AI tech that is so rapidly changing the tech world.\nPivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak has been closely examining the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 and is now offering fresh recommendations on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Let\u2019s take a closer look at what makes these two stand out and why they are receiving Wlodarczak\u2019s endorsement.\nAmazon\nWe\u2019ll start with Amazon, the global leader in online retail. This company is a proven survivor, an original \u2018dot.com\u2019 that survived the tech bubble of the late 90s\u2013early 2000s and has grown to become one of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded firms. While the company started out as an online bookseller, today e-shoppers can find virtually anything on Amazon \u2013 and the company will guarantee delivery almost anywhere in the world.\nAmazon backs up its huge inventory, covering everything from books and toys to pharmaceuticals, clothing, and phone cases, with a network of high-tech warehouses and logistics facilities. The company\u2019s warehouses use AI and robotic tech, backed up by a human workforce, to pack and ship anything to anywhere.\nThis combination of huge inventory and fast delivery has made Amazon the world leader in e-commerce \u2013 and allowed the company to build up an enormous market cap of nearly $2 trillion, making Amazon the world\u2019s fifth-largest public company. Amazon has used its deep pockets to expand its customer base by expanding its product and service offerings.\nOn the product side, Amazon has recently been pushing its \u2018digital pharmacy\u2019 business, allowing customers to fill prescriptions online, with fully accredited pharmacists. Earlier this month, the company announced that it will be opening 20 new pharmacies, doubling the number of cities with same-day delivery service available.\nOn the service side, the company\u2019s cloud computing platform, AWS, has become increasingly popular. AWS, which is a direct competitor to Google Cloud and Microsoft\u2019s Azure, has become an important revenue driver for Amazon \u2013 and accounted for $26.3 billion of the company\u2019s $148 billion topline in Q2 of this year (the last quarter reported). That makes AWS responsible for almost 18% of the total revenue in a quarter that saw 10% year-over-year revenue growth. Amazon has been consistently reporting year-over-year quarterly revenue growth in the low double digits recently and is expected to do so again in the upcoming Q3 report. The top line for the third quarter is expected to exceed $157 billion, which would translate to another 10% year-over-year gain.\nFor analyst Wlodarczak, Amazon presents a solid tale of strength and growth. He writes of the company, \u201cAmazon has a deep moat around their core businesses driven by their unmatched scale and has what appears to be the largest organic revenue growth opportunity of any mega cap tech company (other than arguably NVDA (N/R)) driven primarily by their AWS cloud segment (which we expect to grow from 17% of revenue to ~35% in 5 years), extension of their e-commerce/fulfillment arms into new segments/internationally, continued rapid growth in their advertising business and proven ability to develop new successful products/revenue streams.\u201d\nLooking ahead, Wlodarczak goes on to explain why investors should continue to buy in on AMZN: \u201cThis is all enhanced by what we believe is the highest potential of their peers to materially boost operating margins driven by scale, leveraging robotics/AI and benefits from an increasing % of revenue from high margin cloud computing/advertising combined with what appears to be an attractive valuation.\u201d\nAs expected, after comments like these, Wlodarczak rates Amazon stock as a Buy. His price target, set at $260, points toward a one-year upside potential of 39%. (To watch Wlodarczak\u2019s track record, click here)\nThis major retailer/tech firm has picked up plenty of attention from Wall Street, and mostly all positive. The Strong Buy consensus is based on a lopsided Buy/Hold split of 45 to 2 among the analyst reviews, and the $224.38 average price target implies a 20% upside from the current trading price of $186.89. (See Amazon stock forecast)\nAlphabet\nThe second Mag 7 stock we\u2019ll look at is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and the market\u2019s fourth-largest public company, with a market cap of just over $2 trillion. Alphabet, which also owns YouTube and has been developing an ever-growing presence in the AI field, has built its success on its absolute dominance of the global internet search segment \u2013 and the advantages that brings in the field of digital advertising. Remember that Google and YouTube are the world\u2019s leaders in online search and online video search, respectively.\nIn the last few years, the AI boom has begun to shift the tech landscape in ways that are still not fully clear. Alphabet has been moving to adopt the new technology, seeing it as a multiplier for online search, and as a powerful tool in online and cloud-based applications. The company is using AI tech in its multimodal large language models, which improve both Google\u2019s online translation apps and its search engine functionality. These improvements in generating search results and translation matrixes are a direct response to increased competition from Microsoft\u2019s Bing as well as ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms.\nOn the practical side, Alphabet has released its Gemini platform, its most up-to-date offering in AI. Gemini is based on a core of large language models, designed from the start to understand natural language content \u2013 in text, audio, images, video, and even in code. The platform uses AI to provide the maximum flexibility for the end user\u2019s application, and Alphabet is working to integrate it into all of its products. That includes the Android operating system, which will make Gemini\u2019s AI available on smartphones \u2013 and all of their apps. For Alphabet, the key challenge presented by AI will be maintaining market share in online search as the digital world switches its base to generative AI tools and apps.\nFor now, Alphabet is generating solid revenue and income numbers. The company brought in $84.7 billion in 2Q24, a total that was up nearly 14% from the prior-year quarter and was more than $445 million over the forecast. Alphabet\u2019s bottom line of $1.89 per share was 5 cents over expectations. Analysts are expecting to see revenues of $86.23 billion when the company reports earnings for Q3 later this month.\nTurning again to Pivotal\u2019s Wlodarczak, we find the analyst taking an upbeat view of Alphabet\u2019s stock, its position and prospects. He says, \u201cIf the status quo holds, GOOG appears to be in a very strong competitive position with a deep moat around their dominant core search business model (~90% market share ex China) and an obvious path to leverage 90%+ (ex China) global device presence (which we believe will dominate consumer AI assistant use), a strong AI platform and financial might to increase financial incentives to handset manufacturers for default AI placement. GOOG also holds a strong #3 position in cloud computing, which we believe has dramatic growth potential\u2026\u201d\nLooking ahead, Wlodarczak adds, \u201cThis position is enhanced by the fact that GOOG appears to have the ability, leveraging their AI investment, to significantly reduce their cost structure (mainly through a material reduction in their ~180K employees) offset partially by the aforementioned potentially higher TAC to extend their search handset dominance to AI (if they are not prohibited in doing so by regulators/courts), which should help drive strong financial growth and help them generate a reasonable AI ROIC even if the development of AI revenue generating applications takes longer than expected.\u201d\nIt should come as no surprise that the Pivotal analyst rates GOOGL shares as a Buy, while his price target, $215, suggests an upside of 30% on the one-year horizon.\nFor the Street generally, this is another stock with a Strong Buy consensus. The 39 recent reviews include 30 Buys to 9 Holds. Shares are priced at $165.16 and have an average target price of $201.57, implying a gain of 22% by this time next year.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch.\u00a0Since Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0 ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nWall Street continues to gain momentum amid the latest earnings season and analysts are wondering whether we are still up for soft landing. Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz chief economic advisor, talked about the possibility of a soft landing vs no landing during a program on CNBC. When asked what would it take for the market to have a no-landing scenario, the analyst said:\n\u201cI think we need the productivity enhancers from A.I., from life sciences to come earlier, we need to continue to have positive shocks to our labor force. And if we get those two things, you can get the bigger but not hotter economy which actually would be perfect for almost everything you can think of, from households to companies to financial markets.\u201d\nThe analyst does not rule out the possibility of a recession, however.\n\u201cMy probability of a soft landing is 55%, and a recession is 30%. A soft landing is the most likely scenario, but it\u2019s not dominant. Why isn\u2019t it dominant? Because we have weakness in the household sector, particularly on the lower-income side, and the Fed has been unpredictable. Just think, Morgan\u2014at the end of July, the Fed didn\u2019t cut rates because everything seemed fine. By the next meeting in mid-September, it cut 50 basis points. And now it\u2019s talking about cautious cuts. So, the Fed needs to be careful.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 trending AI stocks based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPhoto by Firmbee.com on Unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\nIn April 2023, Malcolm Ethridge, CIC Wealth executive vice president, on CNBC talked about the threats to Alphabet Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0search business and the defensive posture of Sundar Pichai when it comes to AI.\n\u201cI feel like Google (Alphabet) will be continuously distracted and continuously trying to catch up in this AI arms race. If Google were to lean too far into the generative AI search trend, it would cannibalize too much of their business, as search is their only real revenue source. Even the products they have developed are built around getting users to the search bar quicker than on their competitors\u2019 devices.\nSo far the analyst\u2019s concerns have proved wrong. Why?\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels. \u00a0With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. According to StatCounter report, Bing search engine\u2019s market share only increased from 3.03% in August 2023 to 3.91% in August 2024. This shows MSFT has not been able to make any notable dent in Google\u2019s market share.\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet\u2019s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts\u2019 forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) \u00a0is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\nOakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) was the top detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-based communication services company\u2019s stock price fell after a U.S. District Court ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining a monopoly in general search engine services via exclusive distribution agreements. We think this case is unlikely to hurt Alphabet\u2019s valuation over the long term as regulations previously en[1]acted in the European Union to address similar issues did not materially erode the company\u2019s market share. We continue to believe that Alphabet is an attractive investment.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u00a0ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other good stocks to buy right now.\nOn October 14, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss the latest market trends and share his expectations.\nIn a previous interview, Lee hinted that a period of market volatility is expected, as 2024 heads for a soft landing. However, in this interview, Lee revealed that he had underestimated the market and that it had been extremely resilient and confident, contrary to what he believed earlier. He adds that this indicates the decreasing importance of macroeconomic data to investors.\nLee also adds that for the past two years, investors have been expecting a recession and have held back. Henceforth, with all this cash on the sidelines, investors have been more than willing to invest. October so far has been a great month for the market, despite CPI data being higher than expectations.\nLee emphasizes the need for the Fed to be more supportive as concerns over the job market rise and the upcoming election draws closer. He suggests that despite the election results he expects stocks to perform well in 2025.\nThe market rose to an all-time intraday earlier today and the Fed governor stressed the need for caution amid decreasing interest rates. On October 15, Warren Pies, from 3Fourteen, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss his market thesis for the rest of the year.\nPies suggests that rates are the biggest risk to the market at the moment, especially if drastic measures are introduced. He further adds that if the Fed decides to bring the rate down to 3% immediately, the long-term market outlook could be extremely volatile.\nHe explained that the concern is more about the rate of change and not the absolute level the Fed is trying to achieve. Pies adds that the market still has a lot of room to run before another drastic cut is implemented. He emphasized that the Fed must operate at a pace the market can digest. He also suggested that the market has started to reaccelerate, hinting that a soft landing is more likely.\nNow that we have studied the market outlook up until the end of 2024, let's take a look at some of the good stocks to buy right now.\nOur methodology\nWe used a consensus-based approach and sifted through financial media reports to first compile a list of good stocks to buy right now. We then shortlisted and ranked these stocks by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter of 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported solid earnings in the second quarter of 2024. Its CEO, Sundar Pichai suggests that its performance was largely driven by its growing momentum in search and clod. The company logged nearly $85 billion in revenue, of which search and cloud exceeded $10 billion for the first time in quarterly revenue. The company highlights that it is investing to innovate every layer of the AI stack.\nOn the technology hardware front, its processing units currently account for almost 20% of the market, however, its advancements promise higher market shares in the future. In addition to that, its six-generation chips are 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of processors and its new set of chips will be made available to Google Cloud users by the end of 2024.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) logged revenue worth $85 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, driven by the growing momentum in cloud and search. The technology giant is well-positioned to benefit from the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment.

The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\"\nOverall GOOGL ranks 2nd among the 10 good stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the\u00a010 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts.\nVolatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market.\nA report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds\u00a0and\u00a0David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy.\nWhile expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells.\nThe economist maintains we are marching on ice that\u2019s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.\u201d\n\u201cBut there\u2019s been some cracks in the business cycle,\u201d he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at \u201csuper high\u201d levels.\nA slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election.\nWhile the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around.\n\u201cHistorically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,\u201d Cohen said.\nAlthough there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows.\nAI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta\u2019s share price surge due to strong sales growth.\nAnalysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst\u2019s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 216\nAnalyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 26%\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s wide range of internet-related services and goods allows it to maintain its dominance in the digital market. One of the main factors contributing to Alphabet\u2019s success has been the incorporation of AI throughout its product line.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technologies are improving user engagement and advertising efficiency, from YouTube content recommendations to search algorithms. Despite competition from new chatbot technologies, Alphabet has maintained its market leadership in search thanks to this technological advantage, with reports showing an increase in market share.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s 2024 second-quarter results were outstanding, exceeding revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts. AI-driven advancements that improved ad performance and marketer return on ad spend (ROAS) drove the company\u2019s core search business to show strong growth. Due to the increased demand for AI-related services, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) also demonstrated accelerated growth, surpassing the expansion of the entire cloud segment.\nWith a substantial revenue of $328.28 billion over the past 12 months, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has demonstrated an impressive 13.38% growth in revenue. The analyst\u2019s assessment that search growth projections may have been underestimated is supported by this growth trajectory.\nBecause it is expanding, the digital advertising market is a desirable area to invest in. Digital advertising spending is anticipated to rise by 12% annually in 2024 and maintain double-digit growth through at least 2026.\nConsequently, Google\u2019s ad revenue increased from $42.6 billion in 2023 to $48.5 billion in the second quarter. Almost 60% of Alphabet\u2019s $84.7 billion in Q2 sales came from this. Alphabet gets its ad revenue from sources other than Google. YouTube, the world\u2019s second-largest website after Google, is also owned by the conglomerate. In Q2, YouTube\u2019s ad sales brought in $8.7 billion for Alphabet, up from $7.7 billion the year before.\nThe robust revenue and earnings growth due to AI integration to enhance advertising is one reason the company is rated as a buy with an average price target of $206.60, implying a 26.87% change from the last price of $162.84.\nOverall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). According to the Insider Monkey database,\u00a0Fisher Asset Management\u00a0was the highest stakeholder, with a position of $8.86 billion.\nOverall GOOGL\u00a0ranks 7th\u00a0on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Google (GOOG, GOOGL) is giving its Google Shopping page an artificial intelligence upgrade. The shopping site will now include AI-powered summaries powered by the company's Gemini AI model that offer tips on how to shop for the best option for the product you\u2019re searching for. It will also get new personalized results and personalized deals pages.\nGoogle says the AI summaries will appear in a new module near the top of the screen just below the sponsored products list and provide information about what kind of features to look for when shopping for products and why.\nShares of Google were largely flat on the day.\nIf you're shopping for a kettle for making matcha tea, for example, the AI summaries box will tell you that you should look for kettles with a gooseneck spout for controlled pouring and precise temperature controls. Below that, you\u2019ll see a number of recommendations for products that include bits of information from those AI summaries.\nIn the tea kettle example, Google Shopping highlighted things like \"gooseneck\" and \"temperature control\" found in the recommended products' descriptions, making it easier to understand why Google suggested those options.\nIn another example showing a person searching for the best men\u2019s winter jacket for the Pacific Northwest, the AI recommendation feature explained that coats that offer both warmth and water resistance are best for the region\u2019s famously rainy weather.\nGoogle says users shop more than 1 billion times per day using Google, making this a massive opportunity for Google to prove that its AI upgrades are worthwhile for everyday users.\nIn addition to the AI recommendations, Google said it\u2019s adding a personalized shopping feed to the Google Shopping homepage based on products that users have previously shown an interest in. Google says personalized recommendations can also be turned off via Google Shopping's settings menu.\nThe Deals page, meanwhile, will include personalized deals for products and goods.\nIn addition to Google Shopping, Google has added its Gemini models to its main Google Search product via its AI Overviews feature, as well as a number of its Android apps for smartphones. But it hasn\u2019t been easy going for the company. In May, Google faced considerable backlash, and plenty of mockery, when users found that AI Overviews told them they could eat rocks and put glue on their pizzas.\nGoogle responded by scaling back its rollout to address the issues and ensure the feature doesn\u2019t surface unreliable information.\nGoogle\u2019s updates come as the company seeks to monetize its vast investments in generative AI technologies. In the second quarter, Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet reported spending $2.2 billion building AI models across its DeepMind and Google Research organizations. That's up from $1.1 billion in Q2 2023.\nGoogle isn\u2019t the only company pouring money into generative AI. Microsoft (MSFT) has famously spent billions to team up with OpenAI, while Amazon (AMZN) is investing heavily in Anthropic. Meta is also dumping money into its AI programs, building out its own Llama family of AI models.\nThe Big Tech firms are racing to be the first to reach general artificial intelligence, or artificial intelligence that can rival or outperform your average person. But it will take years and billions of dollars more before they get there \u2014 if they ever do.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on the Magnificent Seven Stocks Plus Netflix.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other magnificent stocks in Jim Cramer's list.\nOn Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique \"Poltergeist 2 magic.\"\nCramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zero-sum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market.\n\u201cUnlike previous Mag 7 rallies, this one\u2019s definitely not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can roar, too, in this market, perhaps because there\u2019s just a lot of money going around.\u201d\nHe noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable.\n\u201cWe know these stocks will once again be hit by endless worries, giving you more opportunities to buy and more weakness before they snap right back and start climbing all over again.\u201d\nCramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial four-week earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added:\n\u201cWhy stress about how quickly the Fed will cut rates, Oh? God, I'm sick of that. What matters is they're giving vast swaths of the economy a big boost and I doubt they'll stop anytime soon.\u201d\nCramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nTalking about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in light of his \u201cown it, not trade it\u201d philosophy, Cramer said:\n\u201cNow I don't feel the same way, candidly, about Alphabet and in part, that's because the government has made it much harder to own it, with this antitrust lawsuit that's aimed for a breakup, something I'm very much opposed to. I'm also concerned about Alphabet's ability to keep putting up strong earnings. Company now has a less defensible position because it's become more of a media business and that's a very competitive space\u2026 So, the stock\u2019s a comeback kid and I am so glad we own some for the Charitable Trust.\u201d\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) serves as the holding company formed from Google's restructuring in 2015, with Google itself primarily recognized as a leading search engine. As a dominant player in the digital advertising sector, the company benefits significantly from its successful Google Search platform, which contributed over half of the company's $84.7 billion in revenue during the second quarter. Google Cloud also reported great performance, achieving a 29% increase in year-over-year revenue growth in the same quarter.\nHowever, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is facing significant legal challenges. The U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company in 2020, accusing it of engaging in monopolistic practices, including paying $26.3 billion in 2021 to companies to secure Google as the default search engine. Recently, there have been indications from the Justice Department suggesting a breakup of Google to address its perceived monopoly in search.\nThe Justice Department's proposed remedies could drastically alter how users will access information online, potentially reducing Google's revenues and allowing competitors to gain a foothold in the market. Additionally, these measures aim to prevent Google from extending its dominance into the growing field of artificial intelligence. There is also speculation that the Justice Department might seek to terminate Google's payments that facilitate its default status on new devices.\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Fatima Gulzar ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Internet Content Stocks to Buy. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks among the best internet content stocks.\nAccording to\u00a0Grand View Research, The global digital content creation market value stood at\u00a0$25.6 billion in 2022\u00a0and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% from 2023 to 2030. In 2023, North America dominated the digital content market. The primary drivers are the increasing use of social media and the digital change occurring across different industries. According to a study by Kepios,\u00a062.3%\u00a0of individuals in the entire globe use social media. As of April 2024, the average daily usage is 2 hours and 23 minutes per this study. Kepios analysis reveals that the number of people using social media grew meaningfully during the first three months of 2024, and annual growth rates are still significantly more than 5%.\nContent creation is also being transformed by artificial intelligence. According to Custom Market Insights, the global market for AI-powered content creation was valued at\u00a0$2.3\u00a0billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.7% to reach USD 7.9 billion by 2033. Moreover, AI programs like GPT-4 are being used to generate graphics, music, and text. Gartner projects that 30% of all digital content will be artificial intelligence generated by 2025. This facilitates hyperpersonalization, which allows material to be personalized to specific consumers while also streamlining the content creation process.\nSecondly, the popularity of short-form video material is skyrocketing, emerging as a major trend in the content production industry. Platforms like Instagram Reels and TikTok have paved the way for this movement. In 2024, 85% of marketers anticipate short-form videos to be the most successful type of social media content, according to a HubSpot survey. The snackable aspect of this format makes it ideal for grabbing the attention spans of increasingly transient internet consumers.\nThirdly, digital content is projected to become more interactive in the future. Advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are opening up greater opportunities for immersive experiences. The AR and VR market is expected to reach\u00a0$1.5\u00a0trillion by 2030, according to a PwC report.\nIf we take a broader view, according to the PWC\u2019s Global Entertainment & Media\u00a0Outlook\u00a02024-2028, there are a number of significant growth prospects in the industry, which is expected to reach US$3.4 trillion by 2028. Notwithstanding persistent upheavals and the necessity of reinventing company models, the industry presents substantial income opportunities. Growth is anticipated to be driven by advertising, with spending forecast to reach US $1 trillion by 2026 because of connected TV and internet advertisements. Due to market saturation, streaming services are being forced to investigate ad-supported business models and creative content. Revenues from gaming are predicted to surpass $300 billion by 2028, particularly in Asia Pacific. The industry is still thriving. Companies navigating shifting market dynamics will find more opportunities in high-growth regions and market categories.\nWe sifted through holdings of Internet Content ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 Internet Content stocks. Then we selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among institutional investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), a holding company, owns all of Google, the biggest online company. Slightly less than 90% of the overall revenue generated by the California-based company is derived from the sales of adverts on Google services. Google services also include online advertisements and sales from Google\u2019s platforms (Play Store sales and in-app purchases), devices (Chromebooks, Pixel smartphones, and smart home products like Chromecast), and subscription services (YouTube TV, YouTube Music, among others). Google Cloud, the company\u2019s cloud computing platform, generates about 10% of Alphabet\u2019s revenue. The remaining amount is derived from the company\u2019s investments in cutting-edge technologies, such as Waymo, Google Fiber, and internet and health access.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is viewed by analysts as a group of exceptional enterprises. It has become a dominant force in the technology industry, generating tens of billions of dollars in free cash flow annually, with offers ranging from self-driving vehicles and cloud computing to advertising. Despite antitrust concerns surrounding Alphabet\u2019s main search business, investors remain confident in the company\u2019s overall strength and believe it will maintain its leadership position in multiple industries, including search, artificial intelligence, video, and cloud computing.\nDiamond Hill Large Cap Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon, Texas Instruments and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Media and technology company Alphabet also continued delivering strong results in its search, YouTube advertising, YouTube subscription and cloud businesses. Shares rose amid an environment that continues favoring mega-cap technology companies.\u201d\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of the best internet content stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other Most Promising Growth Stock According to Hedge Funds.\nInvestors had been anxiously anticipating the start of a bull market, which the S&P 500 confirmed earlier this year. The bull run has seen the market continue to rise to new record highs, supporting revenue and earnings growth across the board.\nFast forward, the upward momentum appears to have peaked, with market indices at record highs. While it was highly expected that stocks would explode on the Federal Reserve offering support to a struggling economy with interest rate cuts, that has not been the case.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy\u00a0and\u00a07 Best Nanotech Penny Stocks to Buy.\nIt\u2019s become increasingly clear that investors have become more sensitive to growth scares as the global economy faces many issues. Top on the list is the rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that threaten to disrupt supply chain networks. Energy prices rising owing to the escalation of a full-blown war could trigger higher inflation, something that is unsettling the markets.\nAnalysts at UBS are already warning investors that they should get overweight on defensive names as global growth slows at the back of deteriorating fundamentals. While UBS doesn\u2019t anticipate a severe downturn, the bank is cautious, advising its clients to focus on important sectors like utilities and pharmaceuticals, which always outperform in a downturn.\nWhile investors are increasingly rotating into defensive plays amid concerns about geopolitical tensions and the slowing global economy, Morgan Stanley Investment Management\u2019s Andrew Slimmon recommends against this strategy.\n\u201cNow is the time to just be cautious. Don\u2019t chase the defensives that are working because I think when we get to the fourth quarter, that won\u2019t work,\u201d the portfolio manager told CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Exchange.\n\u201cWhile our expectation is for October to remain choppy, we don\u2019t view the overall market action to be bearish and encourage investors to maintain perspective on the longer-term trends,\u201d Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, wrote to clients.\nThe sentiments echo the need to focus on high-growth companies. Investors who diversify their portfolio into high-growth companies eventually earn great returns regardless of how much a stock rises or falls in the short term.\nAnalysts project that S&P 500 stocks will grow at a median annual EPS rate of 8.5% over the next five years. On the other hand, the best growth stocks are well poised to outperform this benchmark by a factor of two to three or more.\nFor starters, companies exposed to artificial intelligence spectacles or those leveraging technology continue to deliver record earnings and revenue growth, thus dominating most hedge fund portfolios. Additionally, the most promising growth stocks, according to hedge funds, are those whose core business would be positively impacted by improving consumer purchasing power. As the Fed steers the economy into a soft landing, consumer purchasing is expected to improve, benefiting consumer cyclical stocks. Moreover, the rate cuts will likely benefit growth and tech stocks as well.\nMarket fluctuations are inevitable, but the secret to a growth stock\u2019s success lies in the robustness of its core operations. Regardless of whether a stock is rising or falling in the short term, if you consistently invest in a competitively solid business, you\u2019ll eventually reap substantial rewards.\nPhoto by Kai Wenzel on Unsplash\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to find 30 popular growth stocks.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), a global tech titan, has made a name for itself on a search that continues to power its lucrative advertising business. While the company controls a 90% market share in search, it remains well-positioned to generate significant value as the digital advertising industry grows by more than 15% \u00a0through the rest of the decade.\nAdditionally, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) owns the largest video platform, YouTube, the top streaming service in daily TV viewership. As more families opt to cancel their conventional cable plans in favor of the more affordable and more accessible nature of streaming services, YouTube is expected to attract more viewers. This, in turn, will result in increased advertising income for the company.\nThe ad sales from YouTube brought in $8.7 billion for Alphabet in the second quarter, showing a growth from the $7.7 billion seen in the year before and affirming why it is one of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds.\nOn the other hand, Google Cloud ranks as the third most popular cloud service globally, just after Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Google Cloud reported a 29% increase in revenue from the previous year in the second quarter. Moreover, it achieved $1.2 billion in operating income, achieving a profit margin of 11%.\nThe operating margin for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has consistently been outstanding, averaging a remarkable 26.6%. Its substantial earnings allowed Alphabet to produce an impressive $13.5 billion free cash flow (FCF) during the second quarter. The firm is utilizing this FCF to fund its artificial intelligence technology and benefit its investors by buying back shares and distributing a $0.20 dividend. Analysts on Wall Street maintain a buy rating on Alphabet with an average price target of $206.60, implying 26.77% upside potential.\nAs per the Insider Monkey database, 216 hedge fund portfolios held Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) at the end of the second quarter, which was 222 in the previous quarter.\nOverall GOOGL\u00a0ranks 4th\u00a0on our list of 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), the parent company of Google, is getting absolutely no love from the public markets right now. In fact, from a valuation standpoint, it's actually cheaper than the broader market, measured by the S&P 500.\nThat's an odd statement, considering that Alphabet is one of the most dominant tech companies on the market today. There's a reason for some pessimism with the stock, but is it enough to price it at a discount compared to the S&P 500?\nAlphabet's stock has been fairly cheap throughout 2024, although its current state is about the cheapest it has been.\nOn a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis, Alphabet is cheaper than the S&P 500, regardless of whether you look at trailing earnings or forward earnings. The S&P 500 currently trades for 24.7 times trailing earnings and 23.8 times forward earnings.\nEssentially, the market is saying that Alphabet deserves a lower premium than the average S&P 500 constituent, which is an incredible statement.\nGranted, Alphabet hasn't put itself in the best place, either. The Department of Justice indicated that it could seek to break up the company after Alphabet was found guilty of monopolistic practices. This frightened many investors, as they don't know how Alphabet would be broken up if it was forced to split up. However, this is years away, as Alphabet will challenge every part of this in court. Furthermore, when other companies are split up or divest a portion, the split often unlocks value, making the sum of the parts greater than the whole.\nAlthough the DOJ case is one to watch, I don't think it should factor into an investor's decision to buy the stock.\nAnother reason Alphabet is being doubted is that some are worried the new search engines powered by generative AI could knock Alphabet from its pedestal atop the internet search market. I think there is a very low probability of this happening, as Alphabet's incredible market share (about 90%) means that a large number of people would have to change their habits. Google already added a generative AI-powered summary to the top of its search result, so in some ways, it's already evolved its platform before others could even try to usurp it.\nThere are many pessimistic headlines surrounding Alphabet, which led to its stock becoming so cheap. However, what remains is a company that's still doing quite well and worth investing in now. Its cheap stock price allows both investors and the company itself to get a great deal on the stock.\nBecause Alphabet is on the DOJ's radar, any acquisitions it wants to make are highly scrutinized. So, instead of using its cash pile to buy up other complementary companies, it buys back stock.\nSimilar to how an investor's money can buy more shares of a company with a cheap stock price, a company's buybacks have the same effect. Last quarter, Alphabet bought back $15 billion worth of shares, which reduced the share count by 2.6% year over year.\nAlphabet's share repurchases will have a strong effect over a long time period and further amplify its earnings per share (EPS) growth. Because they reduce the denominator of this metric, they increase the output of the equation. Along with strong revenue growth (14% year over year), improved efficiencies, and share buybacks, Alphabet's EPS increased from $1.44 to $1.89 year over year in the second quarter -- a 31% rise.\nSince stock price movements are highly correlated to earnings growth over the long term, Alphabet is poised to stomp the market in the future if it can keep delivering EPS growth like that. With it already trading at a discount to the broader market, it's about as no-brainer a buy as you can get right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Billionaire Seth Klarman Sold 64% of Baupost's Stake in Alphabet and Is Piling Into This Historically Cheap and Under-the-Radar Drugmaker",
        "Author": "  Sean Williams, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Earnings season has officially kicked off for Wall Street. Over a roughly six-week stretch, a majority of S&P 500 companies will report their operating results from the latest quarter and offer insight on the health of the U.S. economy and consumer.\nBut earnings season is far from the only important data dump investors are privy to each quarter.\nOn Aug. 14, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management were required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This invaluable filing allows investors to see what Wall Street's smartest money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter.\nTo be transparent, 13Fs aren't perfect. They can be 45 days old, when filed, which means they're presenting stale information for active hedge funds. Nevertheless, 13Fs provide insight into which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's most-prominent asset managers.\nThe June-ended quarter was a particularly active period for billionaire Seth Klarman, the CEO and portfolio manager of Baupost Group. The value-focused Klarman, who's modeled his investment philosophy after Benjamin Graham, is overseeing $3.6 billion of invested assets spread across close to two dozen holdings.\nPerhaps the most noteworthy move made by Klarman in the second quarter was to meaningfully pare down the cheapest of all \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). At the same time, Klarman willingly piled into an off-the-radar, but historically inexpensive, drug stock.\nBaupost first initiated a position in Alphabet's Class C shares (GOOG) during the first quarter of 2020 (i.e., during the COVID-19 crash). As of March 31, Klarman's fund held north of 2.9 million shares. But over the course of three months, ended June 30, Baupost's investment leaders, including Klarman, sent 1,888,064 shares of Alphabet to the chopping block, representing a 64% reduction.\nWhile profit-taking is a viable reason for Seth Klarman and his team to reduce their fund's stake in Google, YouTube, and Waymo parent Alphabet by nearly two-thirds, I believe there may four other possible explanations.\nTo start with, Klarman and his crew might be concerned about the stock market being historically pricey. The S&P 500's Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly referred to as the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE ratio), hit its highest level of the year earlier this week (37.70), and has more than doubled its average reading of 17.16, dating back to January 1871. Even though Alphabet's forward P/E ratio is a reasonably low 19, the company's shares would undoubtedly be weighed down if the broad-market indexes were to roll over.\nAlphabet's valuation might be another tipping point for Baupost's chief. Despite Alphabet's stock trading below its average forward P/E multiple over the last five years, it's pricier than its average book value over the last five years, and is no longer the screaming bargain it's been relative to its cash flow. Klarman tends to focus heavily on these traditional fundamental measures of value.\nA third possibility behind this aggressive selling activity in Alphabet's Class C stock is the potential for the U.S. to fall into a recession. The first notable decline in M2 money supply since the Great Depression, along with the longest yield-curve inversion in history, suggest the U.S. economy can stumble in the coming quarters. With Alphabet generating 76% of its net sales from advertising during the June-ended quarter, it would be susceptible to weakness if economic growth were to slow or shift into reverse.\nLastly, Baupost Group's smartest investment minds may have foreseen legal troubles to come for Alphabet. Specifically, the U.S. Justice Department may seek a breakup of Alphabet due to its utter dominance of internet search. Uncertainty tends to be the enemy of investors.\nFor what it's worth, I believe this is a decision Klarman will eventually regret. But with the stock market historically pricey and Klarman being an ardent value investor, this selling activity does makes sense.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Klarman and his team added to nine of Baupost Group's existing positions during the second quarter. Arguably none of these purchases stands out more than drug developer Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: JAZZ).\nDuring the June-ended quarter, Klarman oversaw the addition of 440,552 shares of Jazz, which increased his fund's stake in the company by 53% to 1,274,248 shares. As of the midpoint of 2024, Jazz Pharmaceuticals was Baupost's ninth-largest holding, worth $136 million.\nJazz's oxybate franchise, which is comprised of Xyrem and Xywav (two therapies focused on treating sleep disorders), are what make the company tick. Xyrem was Jazz's blockbuster narcolepsy treatment, while Xywav is its next-generation sleep-disorder therapy. Xywav contains 92% less sodium than Xyrem, which makes it an ideal sleep-disorder therapy for people with cardiovascular concerns. Based on revenue through the first-half of 2024, Jazz's oxybate franchise is pacing $1.6 billion in sales for the current year.\nJazz is also looking for its cannabidiol (CBD)-based therapy, Epidiolex (known as Epidyolex overseas), to eventually reach blockbuster status. Epidiolex was the crown jewel of the $7.2 billion GW Pharmaceuticals acquisition by Jazz in May 2021. It treats rare forms of epilepsy and has limited competition, which has paved a path to steady double-digit sales growth. Epidiolex looks to be on track to generate close to $900 million in full-year revenue in 2024.\nFurthermore, Jazz's oncology segment topped $1 billion in annual sales for the first time in 2023. Much of this growth was fueled by injectable therapy Rylaze, which is a treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphoma. Improved cancer-screening diagnostics and substantive pricing power should lift oncology segment sales to at least $1.1 billion this year.\nDespite steady long-term growth from all three facets of the company's drug portfolio, there's concern that Avadel Pharmaceuticals may eat into Jazz's dominance of the sleep disorder space. Avadel commercially launched Lumryz in the U.S. five months ago, which is a therapy that directly competes with Jazz's oxybate franchise in select indications.\nHowever, a strong argument can be made that these competitive concerns are fully baked in. Shares of Jazz are valued at a little over 5 times Wall Street's consensus earnings per share (EPS) forecast for 2025. This represents a 32% discount to the company's average forward P/E over the trailing-five-year period.\nWhat's more, Jazz Pharmaceuticals has a robust pipeline that currently features more than 30 clinical trials. While there are a handful of label expansion opportunities for Epidiolex, the company's future revolves around its oncology pipeline, which is targeting small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia, among other indications. Just a few wins among these 30-plus trials can be huge for Jazz.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. In this piece, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks among the list of Goldman Sachs' Phase 2 AI stocks.\nWhile consumer technology stocks had soared in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, back then, their share price gains were due to. the growing demand for technology products and services due to lock downs. Now, big technology stocks have persisted in their strong performance despite high interest rates since they have been judged by the market as the top innovators and performers in the artificial intelligence industry.\nSince AI is somewhat of a ubiquitous technology, its impact is on several industries. So far, we\u2019ve seen most of the stock market returns related to AI directly tied to just one stock. This stock continued to be the fifth most trending AI stocks as recently as in mid October and its share price returns are nothing short of unbelievable. From its bottom in October 2022 when the split adjusted share price was a mere $11.23, the shares have gained a stunning 1,100%. In other words, if you had invested just $100 back then in the shares and then held onto them for dear life, your investment would be worth $1,200 today.\nThis is the magic of AI, a technology that has caught Wall Street and retail investors alike by storm. However, AI\u2019s impact, and its enablement, aren\u2019t limited to the GPU designer we\u2019ve mentioned above. While GPUs are the \u2018oil\u2019 for this technology, a wide variety of other components from data center infrastructure, networking equipment, connectivity, and energy all will have to play their part if OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s plans of initially building as many as 7 AI data centers across the US, with each data center guzzling an unbelievable 5 Gigawatts of electricity, are to come to fruition.\nThis then makes us ask, what are such stocks that might enable 35 Gigawatts of AI data centers across the US? After all, in order to meet the world\u2019s demand for AI chips, Altman believes that an unfathomable $7 trillion will need to be spent for building 36 chip manufacturing fabs and additional AI data centers. This money has to be spent somewhere, and therein lies the answer to our question. Things get clearer when we look at a detailed research report from investment bank Goldman Sachs. This report segregated the AI sector into four categories.\nThe first category only included Wall Street\u2019s AI darling, the second was made of AI capacity providers like server companies, other semiconductor firms, and utilities, the third included firms that sell AI products and software, and the fourth category firms were those that will benefit from AI adoption. In its report, the investment bank shared that year to date in July, the first category had returned 139%. As of mid October, this category has gained 179% on the stock market, so safe to say returns have accelerated despite some turbulence in between. By July, the second group of firms was also doing well. Its returns ranged between ~-8% to ~50%, with the average stock having delivered 22%.\nZooming into these firms, the utility sector is one which had particularly impressed the bank. It shared that utilities were the best performing sector in the flagship S&P index between March and May courtesy of their 16% returns. Their three month returns ranked in the 98th percentile since 2022 and were the third highest after 2003 and 2020 rallies. This outperformance is unsurprising given the strong investments in data centers that have taken the US by storm this year.\nThese investments have led to estimates suggesting that America\u2019s data center hub, Northern Virginia, will require 11,000 megawatts of electricity by 2035 \u2013 demand which has already spurred $5.2 billion in investments for transmission lines and coal fired power plants. Estimates from Boston Consulting Group believe that by 2030, AI will account for 16% of America\u2019s energy consumption and touch 130 gigawatts. For a detailed look at the link between electricity use and data centers, you should read 15 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Jefferies, Citi and Wall Street Analysts.\nThe bustling optimism surrounding AI is also reflected in revenue estimates. Goldman\u2019s September 2024 research shows that 2025 revenue estimates of semiconductor firms, software enablers, and hardware firms except semiconductors are roughly 2.3x, 2.05x, and 1.8x over 2019 levels, respectively. Similarly, non semiconductor hardware companies have seen their revenue forecasts for Q4 2025 jump to $450 billion for a $380 billion gain over Q1 2024\u2019s $70 billion. Makes us wonder whether it\u2019s this group of companies that might see a stock mirror the 1,100% returns of Wall Street\u2019s AI darling.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 best phase 2 AI stocks, we ranked the 20 stocks with the highest year to date returns and some other big tech and data center names that have announced multi billion dollars in capital expenditure by their year to date performance.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) is the mega cap technology company that earns most of its revenue through its search engine, Google Search. Its dominance in the global search industry, which sees it operate across all ends from serving as a marketplace for ads to running the ads on its platforms, has enabled Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) to build a fortress balance sheet. Its cash and equivalents sit at $111 billion which enables the firm to play a leading role in the cloud computing industry. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a diversified AI company, since not only does it offer AI products and services along with the Gemini APU, but it also offers tensor processing unit (TPU) chips to others to run their AI workloads. One of its biggest TPU customers is Apple, and its AI platform means that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is both an AI enabler and an AI beneficiary.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 23rd on our list of Goldman Sachs' top phase 2 AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "A Google Breakup Could Be Coming. Is Alphabet Stock a Buy?",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) investors have had a lot to digest in recent months. In August, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta concluded that Google had illegally exploited its search dominance to quash competition and stifle innovation and ultimately engaged in monopolistic competition, thereby violating antitrust law.\nIn a court filing this week, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) offered up a list of potential remedies to the judge, the most egregious of which was a breakup of the company.\nThe potential implications have some investors asking the quintessential investing question: Is Alphabet stock a buy?\nTo be clear, DOJ officials are considering a number of remedies to address Google's search dominance, and many of those are much less severe:\nA breakup of Alphabet into several smaller companies\nForcing Google to share the data that underpins its search results\nRestrictions on how it mines data from other sites to fuel its search algorithms\nBlocking the company from paying rivals -- including Apple -- to be their default search engine.\nPreventing Google from using its Android, Chrome, Play, and other products to fuel its search engine.\nThe judge will have the last word and could choose any of the recommendations proposed by the DOJ or some combination of remedies.\nGoogle didn't take the news lying down, releasing a blog post saying the \"DOJ's radical and sweeping proposals risk hurting consumers, businesses, and developers.\" The company went on to say the DOJ's proposals \"go far beyond the specific legal issues in this case.\" Google plans to \"respond in detail\" to those proposals.\nThat said, it's unlikely Alphabet will be broken up.\nInvestors concerned about a breakup need only look to history to see just how rare such a drastic step is. After Microsoft was found guilty of being a monopoly in 2000, the court sought to break the company up into two parts. However, the verdict was partially overturned on appeal. Microsoft ultimately settled with the Justice Department to change some of its offending business practices.\nWhile breaking up monopolies was commonplace in the early 20th century, it's been decades since the most recent instance. In the early 1970s, AT&T controlled the vast majority of the nationwide phone system in the U.S. at a time when mobile phones were still on the drawing board, providing communication services to 90% of the homes in the country. The DOJ filed an antitrust lawsuit in 1974, and after a court battle that lasted eight years, AT&T agreed to break its business into seven regional phone systems.\nThis helps to illustrate just how rare these breakups are and why one is unlikely now.\nTo be clear, a decision on the matter won't be coming anytime soon. The judge has set a date for April 2025 to hear motions on a remedy and doesn't plan to issue a decision until August. Even then, the legal case likely won't be over, as Google has already said it plans to appeal the verdict, though it can't even file an appeal until the judge issues his ruling. Furthermore, the appeals process is expected to last as long as five years, so this case is far from over.\nSo, what does that mean for investors? Until there's a final disposition of the case -- which is likely still years away -- business will continue as usual. Google remains the undisputed leader in search, with 90% of the market. This fuels the company's industry-leading digital advertising, which controlled 27% of the market last year. Then there's Google Cloud, the third-largest of the \"Big Three\" cloud infrastructure providers, with 10% of that market. Artificial Intelligence (AI) also represents a large and growing opportunity for the company.\nA breakup is unlikely, but if it does occur, it could benefit shareholders. There are aspects of Alphabet's business that analysts don't typically try to value, including YouTube and Waymo. If its disparate businesses are valued separately, the company may actually be worth more than many believe. In an interview with CNBC's Fast Money, veteran tech analyst Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management suggests a breakup could unlock value in the company of between 15% and 20%. Furthermore, in the event of any divestment, existing shareholders would ultimately own shares in the resulting businesses.\nFinally, the uncertainty resulting from the verdict has some Alphabet investors on edge. As a result, the stock has fallen 15% from its recent high, presenting a compelling opportunity. Alphabet stock is currently selling for just 23 times earnings, a significant discount to a multiple of 30 for the S&P 500. It's also a discount to Alphabet's average price-to-earnings ratio of 30 over the past decade.\nThis is all a long way of saying ignore the noise and buy Alphabet stock.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Author": "  GuruFocus News ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.\nAs of 2024-10-14, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $220.03. It's currently trading at a price of $163.24. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 25.81%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$7.04\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.1%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 21.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n121.55\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n126.72\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n220.03\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $148.13. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -10.2%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Talha Qureshi ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable in 2024. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks among the high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable.\nMalcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, joined CNBC to talk about where the market could go and his sentiment regarding the AI and overall tech sector. While many analysts believe that it will be the small caps that will lead the growth with interest rates easing and the economy slowing down. We recently covered the\u00a08 Most Undervalued Penny Stocks To Buy According To Analysts, where we talked about how Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors likes the small cap in the current market environment. Here\u2019s a piece from the article:\n\u201cTo talk about what the stock market looks like today and in the near future. Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors joined CNBC in a recent interview. He has been one of the strong proponents and supporters of small-cap stocks. Lee says that we are in a volatile environment currently, due to a few reasons, one being the elections in less than 30 days, the second being the Middle Eastern crisis which is scaring investors, and lastly the port strike that has the potential to cripple the economy. However, he still expressed his optimism that the year-end has a lot of tailwinds and investors shouldn\u2019t be afraid to buy the dip. Moreover, Lee also highlighted that these current events are all short-term headwinds in a buying cycle and are expected to die down quickly.\nEthridge thinks otherwise, he believes that mega-cap stocks will continue to lead market growth, although not at the same pace as in recent years but still at a steady pace. He attributes this to the ongoing influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on various sectors, including real estate and manufacturing, which are becoming increasingly vital due to rising demands on infrastructure.\nMoreover, while explaining why the mega caps will lead the growth, Ethridge pointed out that for the big tech stocks, Fed rate cuts were not necessary as they had significant cash on their balance sheets to reinvest into newer AI ventures. We have already seen Magnificent Seven invest heavily in AI despite the high rate of borrowing thereby leading the bull market in difficult times.\nThe rate cuts have now made it easy for other companies that didn\u2019t have enough cash to borrow and invest in technology. However, he also pointed out that the pace of rate cuts might slow down moving forward, thereby making it hard for small caps to keep up the technology investment race. Ethridge suggests that investors may need to adjust their expectations regarding future Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nMoreover, we are also entering earnings season, will the earnings derail the momentum or continue to boost the market? Drew Pettit, Citi Research Director of US Equity Strategy joined CNBC in another interview. He thinks that we are in for a decent quarter, although we are in an expensive market.\nWhile talking about how various sectors will perform, Pettit mentioned that software has the highest bar within tech, meaning its growth expectations are high, yet many software companies are not monetizing effectively. This creates volatility in stock performance. As earnings reports come in, Pettit suggests investors should focus on consumer behavior and credit conditions, particularly in the banking sector, which is expected to perform well this quarter. He also encouraged investors to look beyond the recent quarter earnings into 2025 and 2026, while choosing companies to invest in.\nOur Methodology\nTo curate the list of 10 high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable in 2024 we used the Finviz stock screener, Seeking Alpha, and Yahoo Finance as our sources. Using the stock screener, we got an initial list of major NASDAQ stocks sorted by their market capitalization. Next, we sourced the 5-year net income growth and revenue growth rates for these stocks from Seeking Alpha and the GAAP trailing twelve-month net income from Yahoo Finance. We only selected stocks that had 5-year net income and revenue growth of more than 15%. Lastly, we ranked the stocks by the number of hedge fund holders in Q2 2024 from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n5-Year Net Income Growth: 20.33%\n5-Year Revenue Growth: 17.23%\nTTM Net Income: $87.66 Billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks 3rd on our list of high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable in 2024. It is one of the Magnificent Seven technology companies known for its subsidiary Google.\nThe company has significant development in artificial intelligence, Google Cloud, and is known for its other products as well including YouTube, Gmail, and Android Operating systems among others. Investors are on the lookout for its autonomous driving venture, Waymo.\nWhile Tesla gets the majority coverage when it comes to self-driving car ambition, however, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) with its Waymo venture has quietly made significant progress. Last week the company announced a significant robotaxi deal with Hyundai, a South Korean automaker. With this multi-year strategic partnership, Hyundai will use the autonomous driving technology of Waymo in 5 of its SUVs for the next 5 years.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) plans to launch its robotaxis for test drives by the end of 2025 and is expected to deploy a large fleet on public roads in the following years. It won\u2019t be wrong to say that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is leading the robotaxi race as a fleet of around 700 self-driving cars are already operating in major states of the United States including Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The company is testing its services in Texas as well.\nIf we talk about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as a whole, the company has been generating significant revenues on the back of its search and cloud segments. The revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was up 14% year-over-year to reach $85 billion. Moreover, the company has generated more than $87 Billion in net income on a trailing twelve-month basis.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nTwo years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nAmid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.\nAs semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. JPMorgan recently maintained an Overweight rating on the shares with a $208 price target. The investment firm detailed in a research note that the Department of Justice's remedies framework in the Google search commercial agreements trial were mostly in-line with expectations. However, per the advisory, the DOJ's final proposed remedies were not due until November 20, and as a result, the initial framework was somewhat broad and unspecific in terms of exact remedies. JPMorgan added that while there were not any major surprises, the preliminary framework carried headline risk and suggested structural changes or separation proposals were possible for Alphabet. However, the advisory did not believe the high-level framework changed much for the shares in the near-term.\nOverall GOOG ranks 6th among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The firm has advised clients to sell Roku's stock over much of the past three years due to a strong conviction that consensus was mismodeling the drivers of Platform revenues, compounded by \"incredibly poor financial disclosure,\" but it has softened its view as it looks into the second half of 2024 and 2025.\nDA Davidson upgraded Datadog (DDOG) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $140, up from $115. The firm's proprietary developer data showed a strong positive inflection point for Datadog, which gives the firm confidence in the trajectory of demand.\nWedbush upgraded Dine Brands (DIN) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $47, up from $34. The firm believes the company's current sales challenges are well understood and reflected in the stock's \"depressed valuation.\"\nSusquehanna upgraded Coherent (COHR) to Positive from Neutral with a price target of $120, up from $80. The firm believes new CEO Jim Anderson, and his platform optimization program, will \"ultimately transform the company's long-term financial model,\" potentially providing the company with over 1,000 basis points of net margin expansion.\nGoldman Sachs upgraded Ford (F) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $13, up from $12. There is a margin opportunity driven by the company's more profitable commercial business - Ford Pro, with mid-teens EBIT margins - and growing software and services mix, and the management's cost actions in internal combustion vehicles and EVs can help to offset industry headwinds, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nRaymond James downgraded Disney (DIS) to Market Perform from Outperform. The firm sees demand moderating at the company's amusement parks after a strong post-COVID surge and says the shares are expected to remain range bound as it contends that consumers are still digesting price increases taken in the past roughly four years.\nWells Fargo downgraded General Dynamics (GD) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $317, down from $334, as the firm is cautious on the company and Boeing (BA) into the Q3 results. General Dynamics' 2024 guidance looked tough to hit at mid-year, and since then G700 deliveries appear to be well behind plan, Wells tells investors in a research note.\nCiti downgraded Hologic (HOLX) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $85, down from $95. The firm believes current fiscal 2025 estimates are too high and will likely need to be lowered, driven by normalization of demand.\nCiti downgraded HP Inc. (HPQ) to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged price target of $37. The firm cites a more cautious view of the PC recovery in the second half of 2024 for the downgrade.\nOppenheimer downgraded Global Payments (GPN) to Perform from Outperform following analyst coverage transfer. Despite the recent stock pullback, the firm remains cautious on Global Payments, particularly as the acquiring industry remains \"intensely competitive.\"\nTop 5 Initiations: \nPivotal Research initiated coverage of Meta Platforms (META) with a Buy rating and $780 price target. The firm sees a \"strong\" revenue growth outlook from increased usage, new products, better targeting and higher prices, boosted by cost efficiencies and eventually materially declining Reality Labs losses combined \"with what appears to be an attractive valuation.\"\nPivotal Research initiated coverage of Alphabet (GOOG) with a Buy rating and $215 price target. If \"the status quo holds,\" Alphabet appears to be in a \"very strong competitive position with a deep moat\" around its dominant core search business model and an \"obvious path\" to leverage its global device presence, strong artificial intelligence platform and \"financial might\" to increase financial incentives to handset manufacturers for default AI placement, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nOppenheimer initiated coverage of SharkNinja (SN) with an Outperform rating and $120 price target. The firm notes the company's management team has executed quite well delivering consistent and well above expectation results in recent quarters, even in difficult U.S. consumer durables backdrop.\nPiper Sandler initiated coverage of Labcorp (LH) with a Neutral rating and $235 price target. The firm sees LabCorp as leading the industry in diagnostics services for decades, but with the stock's run over the last six months, Piper thinks the risk/reward is balanced at these levels.\nArgus initiated coverage of Snowflake (SNOW) with a Hold rating. The company is in a building phase as it invests in new product enhancements, particularly around AI/machine learning which are not generating near-term revenue, even though they may begin to payoff sometime in the future, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Invest In.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other profitable blue chip stocks.\nThe September inflation report came in hotter than expected and showed that it remains sticky. Headline inflation rose by 2.4%, slightly above the anticipated 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. Month-over-month, CPI increased by 0.2%, exceeding the forecast of 0.1%.\nCore inflation, excluding food and energy, also came in higher than expected at 3.3%, compared to the anticipated 3.2%, marking a slight increase from August. On a monthly basis, core CPI rose by 0.3%, which matched August\u2019s figures but was above expectations of 0.2%.\nFollowing the report, the market is expecting a 25 basis points rate cut to no rate cuts in the upcoming Fed meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 79.9% of interest rate traders expect the rate cuts to be at 450-475 bps at the coming Fed meeting while 20.1% expect the rate cut to stay the same. At the beginning of the month, 32.1% expected a 50 bps rate cut, while 67.9% anticipated a 25 bps cut.\nDespite the sticky inflation, IBM's vice chair, Gary Cohn believes that the Fed will cut rates by 100 bps this year. In an interview at CNBC's \u2018Money Movers',\u00a0he suggested that the U.S. is experiencing what a soft landing looks like, with inflation decreasing but not steadily. He indicated that reaching the Fed's 2% target will be challenging, as inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around this level.\nCohn noted that for the first time in nearly two decades, the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate, employment, and price stability, after focusing primarily on one at a time. He believes the Fed is making the right decisions and is currently in a delicate position as it missed meeting opportunities this year.\nCohn expects that the Fed will implement a total of 100 basis points in rate cuts this year, likely consisting of 25 basis point reductions over the next couple of months. When asked about inflation targets, he expressed a preference for slightly exceeding the target inflation rate, suggesting that a rate of around 2.2% would be more acceptable in a growing economy than undershooting the target.\nCohn also highlighted concerns about geopolitical risks and said that global tensions could lead to inflationary pressures by disrupting supply chains and increasing shipping costs.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we use stock screeners to identify nearly 30 stocks above $100 billion market cap and $10 billion TTM net income. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks that had a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate of above 10% and were most widely held by institutional investors. The most profitable blue chip stocks are listed in ascending order of the hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 database of 912 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nMarket Cap: $2 Trillion\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 20.33%\nTTM Net Income: $87.657 billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nOne of the most profitable blue chip stocks, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another contender for the most profitable blue chip stocks and is another company on our list that is a part of the tech Big Five. The company\u2019s infrastructure includes a diverse range of subsidiaries, with Google remaining its largest and most well-known entity, which oversees services like Android, YouTube, and Google Search.\nOther subsidiaries focus on multiple sectors, including health, venture capital, and autonomous driving. The company\u2019s mission is to organize global information and make it accessible, with Google Search, YouTube, Google Assistant, and Google Cloud as key tools for users and businesses.\nAI is also a big part of the company and has been integrated into its products for over a decade and powers features like Google Translate and Google Photos. Its latest AI model, Gemini, introduced in 2023, further advances its capabilities across several data types.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is experiencing a pebble in its shoe as it is facing intensified antitrust scrutiny in the U.S. The Justice Department is considering forcing it to spin off certain services to address monopolistic practices in online searches.\nHowever, Mizuho Securities analyst James Lee has still reaffirmed a Buy rating on the company\u2019s stock due to its strong fundamentals and a positive outlook despite regulatory hurdles.\nTipRanks reported that Lee's analysis considers the Department of Justice's proposed changes to Google\u2019s search operations, which include banning certain exclusive agreements and mandating the sharing of search and AI-related data. He believes these adjustments may have some structural implications but will not significantly weaken Google's market position.\nHe believes that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) can effectively manage these regulatory challenges. Additionally, the proposed remedies regarding search result displays and advertising are expected to have minimal effects on the company\u2019s overall operations.\nPatient Capital Management stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the most profitable blue chip stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of George Soros Net Worth and Top 10 Holdings in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands in the list of George Soros Net Worth and Top 10 Holdings in 2024.\nGeorge Soros is one of the biggest investors, businessmen, and philanthropists. Soros currently has a net worth of $7.2 billion, as of October 4, according to Forbes. The legendary billionaire investor managed client money between 1969 and 2011. Soros made a fortune after shorting the British pound in 1992, making $1 billion. He has donated over $32 billion to his philanthropic organization, Open Society, of which almost $15 billion has been distributed. You can also read our piece on the\u00a0best growth stocks to buy according to George Soros.\nSoros is the author of multiple books including the very popular The Alchemy of Finance, Soros on Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve, and The New Paradigm for Financial Markets: The Credit Crisis of 2008 and What it Means. He last wrote a book in 2019 named In Defense of Open Society. The book is a collection of Soros\u2019 writings on various topics including artificial intelligence, machine learning, political philanthropy, and financial markets.\nAccording to Soros, AI poses a threat to democracies especially with its extensive surveillance capabilities. He suggests that to distinguish between right and wrong humans must strike a balance between understanding reality and assessing how to change the world in our favor. Artificial intelligence destroys the very essence of reality, creating a disbalance. Soros emphasizes the need for AI to be regulated but for these regulations to work, societies from across the globe must work together. He also added that in an ideal world, standard regulations may have been possible but our countries our run on two distinct ideologies, the open and closed society. Here is what Soros stated:\n\u201cAI destroyed this simple schema because it has absolutely nothing to do with reality. AI creates its own reality and when that artificial reality fails to correspond to the real world \u2013which happens quite often \u2014 it is discarded as hallucination. This made me almost instinctively opposed to AI and I wholeheartedly agree with the experts who argue that it needs to be regulated. But AI regulations have to be globally enforceable, because the incentive to cheat is too great; those who evade the regulations gain an unfair advantage.\u201d\nAdding to this, he suggests that while AI may make closed societies more powerful it may pose a threat to open societies. In addition to that, Soros suggested that repressive regimes like China and Russia are benefitting from the incidence of AI and thus are able to garner greater control over less powerful nations. His primary concern around AI and technology is surveillance and the misuse of data. Soros said the following about the future of AI:\n\u201cAI is developing incredibly fast, and it is impossible for ordinary human intelligence to fully understand it. Nobody can predict where it will take us. But we can be sure of one thing: AI helps closed societies and poses a mortal threat to open societies. That\u2019s because AI is particularly good at producing instruments of control that help closed societies to surveil their subjects.\u201d\nSoros founded the Soros Fund Management LLC, a private investment management firm in 1970. He is known for his contrarian investing philosophy and has made fortunes for himself and investors through his strategies. His hedge fund is based on the idea of making elaborate one-way bets on currency movements, commodity prices, stocks, bonds, and any assets driven by macroeconomic conditions.\nSoros is known to have let macroeconomic conditions shape his investment decisions. This is a crucial aspect of his trading strategy referred to as reflexivity. This strategy defies standard economic conditions and emphasizes that market participants have the power to influence market fundamentals, and consequently the financial market. In light of his contrarian investment philosophy, Soros said the following in his book, Staying Ahead of the Curve:\n\u201cThe prevailing wisdom is that markets are always right. I take the opposition position. I assume that markets are always wrong. Even if my assumption is occasionally wrong, I use it as a working hypothesis. It does not follow that one should always go against the prevailing trend. On the contrary, most of the time the trend prevails; only occasionally are the errors corrected. It is only on those occasions that one should go against the trend. This line of reasoning leads me to look for the flaw in every investment thesis. \u2026 I am ahead of the curve. I watch out for telltale signs that a trend may be exhausted. Then I disengage from the herd and look for a different investment thesis. Or, if I think the trend has been carried to excess, I may probe going against it. Most of the time we are punished if we go against the trend. Only at an inflection point are we rewarded.\u201d\nNow that we have studied one of Soros\u2019s most important investment philosophies, let\u2019s take a look at the top 10 holdings of George Soros.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through Soros Fund Management\u2019s Q2 2024 13F filings and picked the fund\u2019s top 10 picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the fund\u2019s stakes in them. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest holdings of George Soros. The company owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Wyamo.\nThe company is relentlessly working to improve the Gemini experience and is also actively involved in developing AI hardware, having launched its NVIDIA chip rival in May.\nWhile Google\u2019s tensor processing units (TPU) only account for almost 20% of the market, its advancements promise higher market shares in the future. In addition to that, its six-generation chips are 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of processors. The new chip will be made available to Google Cloud users by the end of 2024.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) logged revenue worth $85 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, driven by the growing momentum in cloud and search. Additionally, over 60% of generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud. One can infer that the technology giant is well-positioned to exploit the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment.\nAnalysts are bullish on GOOGL and their 12-month median price target of $205 points to a 26% upside from current levels. Overall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Of those,\u00a0Fisher Asset Management\u00a0was the highest stakeholder with a position of $8.86 billion.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter\u201c\n\u201cAlphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7.

While we acknowledge the potential of healthcare companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list titled\u00a0Leon Cooperman Stock Portfolio: Top 12 Picks. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks among other stocks in Leon Cooperman\u2019s portfolio.\nOmega Advisors, Inc., an investment firm based in New York, specializes in providing advisory and portfolio management services. The firm focuses on domestic public equity and employs hedging strategies to protect its investments. Leon Cooperman, the chairman and CEO, follows a value-oriented investment strategy that emphasizes value equities and utilizes a top-down approach to select sectors for investment. His methodology integrates fundamental analysis to manage both long and short positions, which helps in constructing diversified portfolios. These portfolios are assessed against the S&P 500 index to gauge their performance effectively.\nLeon G. Cooperman is a billionaire investor known for his significant contributions to the investment landscape. He is the first in his family to earn a college degree, graduating from Hunter College, where he was active in the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. After completing his education, Cooperman began his career as a quality control engineer at Xerox in 1965 and later earned an MBA from Columbia Business School in 1967. He is also a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), which reflects his deep knowledge of investment analysis and portfolio management.\nIn a recent CNBC interview on September 25, Leon Cooperman expressed significant concerns about two main issues affecting the economy. He highlighted the national debt, which has surged from $20 trillion in 2017 to $34 trillion in 2024, growing at a rate that far outpaces the economy. He warns that this increase could lead to serious problems in the future, especially since candidates running for office are not addressing the deficit.\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned about two things. One is the debt buildup. We have two candidates running for office, and neither one talks about the deficit or the buildup of debt. In 2017, I think our national debt was $20 trillion. Seven years later, it\u2019s $34 trillion. That\u2019s a growth rate far in excess of the growth rate of the economy, and it\u2019s going to be a problem one day.\u201d\nWhen asked if the Fed\u2019s rate cuts have led him to invest more in stocks, Leon Cooperman replied that he is already fully invested, primarily in various assets. He has allocated about 20% of his portfolio to bonds and believes the government\u2019s conduct is disappointing. Additionally, he has around 15% in energy investments, seeing potential in that sector due to current events in the Middle East. He noted that while the Fed is cutting short-term rates, he anticipates long-term rates will rise, particularly for ten-year bonds.\nCooperman was also asked about the Fed\u2019s rate cuts and their impact on the economy. He responded that short-term rates are currently too high compared to historical standards. He explained that the yield on the ten-year government bond should align with GDP growth, which he estimates at around 5% (2.5% real growth plus 2.5% inflation). He believes that at a 5% yield, the ten-year bond is undervalued and anticipates rates will rise.\nLeon Cooperman expressed concerns about the potential future problems with government debt, suggesting that issues may arise unexpectedly.

        "Author": "  Neha Gupta ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the\u00a0Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other the Bill Ackman's Stock Portfolio.\nBill Ackman is an investor whose portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from the economic environment\u2019s improvement as interest rates trend down. In addition to being vocal about investment opportunities especially when there is a high risk reward, Ackman also does not shy away from giving his opinion on what he thinks is wrong. In September he took on the Brazilian Supreme Court justice on its decision to block Elon Musk\u2019s social networking app. The billionaire investor reiterated that the decision could end up driving away investors and harming the country.\nThe \u201cillegal shut down of X and account freeze at Starlink put Brazil on a rapid path to becoming an uninvestable market,\u201d Ackman said in a post on X. \u201cChina committed similar acts leading to capital flight and a collapse in valuations. The same will happen to Brazil unless they quickly retreat from these illegal acts.\u201d\nIt is not the first time that the legendary investor has echoed his opinion having already withheld a huge donation from Harvard University because of purported anti-Semitism. He also played a role in bringing down President Claudine Gay.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a010 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy at 52-Week Lows\u00a0and\u00a07 Worst Beaten Down Stocks to Invest In.\nCan Geopolitical Tensions and Inflation Impact Ackman\u2019s Portfolio?\nAckman stands out among the top echelons because he focuses on high-quality large-cap companies with limited downside potential. Over the past five years, the billionaire investor has generated a 31% annualized return, affirming why he is one of the most revered investors on Wall Street.\nThe fundamental value investor has made a name for himself in investing and pushing for strategic changes in companies in a bid to increase shareholder value. Ackman\u2019s investment strategy focuses on holding a limited number of companies, mostly eight to 12, for the long term in his portfolio.\nAs one of the sharpest investors on Wall Street,\u00a0 Bill Ackman\u2019s stock portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from an improving investment environment. The US Federal Reserve cutting interest rate by 50 basis points is increasingly emerging as a key catalyst poised to push the overall market higher.\nWhile the S&P 500 was already up by more than 15% before the interest rate cut, it is currently flirting with record highs with more than 20% gains. The rally came on growing optimism that the lower interest rate environment would support the US economy, which was struggling, as depicted by weakness in the labor market and slow manufacturing.\nWhile an accommodative interest rate environment is a must-welcome factor that could drive Ackman\u2019s portfolio higher, a combination of regional conflict in the Middle East and rising inflation could curtail the gains. According to Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center, a completely blown conflict in the Middle East could trigger inflationary risks even as central banks start easing monetary policy.\nRoach expects the markets to whipsaw back and forth amid heightened volatility in response to the geopolitical tensions. Kelvin Tay, regional chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, has already warned that Israel\u2019s response to Iran\u2019s attack could throw the Fed\u2019s 50 basis point rate cut off track.\nBill Ackman\u2019s portfolio could feel the effects of escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East on the investment environment turning jittery.\u00a0 The portfolio suffered one of its biggest losses in July as it erased most of its 2024 gains. The portfolio lost 4.7% in the month, fueled by losses in one of Ackman\u2019s investments in a large record label.\nThe string of negative losses persisted, with Ackman struggling to generate interest in his plan for one of his investment firms in the market. After failing to garner enough investor interest, the planned launch of Pershing Square USA (PSUS) IPO, which Bill Ackman once claimed could raise $25 billion, was canceled.\nAckman confirmed the withdrawal, reiterating that they will revisit the IPO once they are ready to launch a revised transaction. The pullback comes on investors raising concerns about the proposed fund\u2019s structure and where he knew cash would be invested given that the market is at an all-time high with valuations getting out of hand. With that, let\u2019s dig deeper into Bill Ackman\u2019s stock portfolio.\nSource: Unsplash\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through Pershing Square\u2019s Q2 2024 13F filings and picked the hedge fund\u2019s top 8 stock picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of Pershing Square\u2019s stake in them, as of June 30. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 216\nPershing Square\u2019s Equity Stake: $1.38 Billion\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has to be Ackman\u2019s biggest holding in the technology sector while offering exposure to the artificial intelligence frenzy. While many investors were worried about how AI would affect Alphabet\u2019s core Google business, Ackman\u2019s firm purchased more shares. His fund holds 7.55 million shares of the company, as of Q2 2024.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s core business is well-positioned to benefit from AI. Google Cloud\u2019s revenue growth is already accelerating, reaching a $10 billion quarterly revenue run rate thanks to artificial intelligence.\nSeveral well-known AI companies use Google Cloud to train and implement their AI models and services. Conversely, chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT don\u2019t seem to have impacted core Search ad revenue thus far. In the latest quarter, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s primary product saw a 14% increase in revenue. Nevertheless, it observed some weakness in the growth of YouTube ad revenue.\nIn the age of artificial intelligence (AI), Ackman has stated that he believes Alphabet has a competitive advantage due to the data it generates from search and related products. The gamble has paid off thus far, as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has outperformed the S&P 500. The company has also dismissed worries that chatbots like ChatGPT will eventually disrupt search.\nGoogle is reducing expenses across the board even as it keeps making significant investments in its data centers to increase its AI inference and training capacity. Because of this, the operating margin is rising swiftly and contributing to the bottom line\u2019s growth. For the next five years, analysts currently project earnings per share growth of more than 20% annually from Alphabet.\nIn addition to the robust growth, Alphabet remains one of Ackman\u2019s top holdings, yielding 0.48% on dividends while trading at a discount with a price-to-earnings multiple of 19. There were 216 hedge funds long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $35.31 billion.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe also added to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company reported solid financial results with first quarter revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, driven by 14% growth in search, 21% growth in YouTube, and 28% growth in cloud (which accelerated from 26% growth in the fourth quarter). The company has also increased its cost discipline efforts, which drove operating margins to 31.6% (compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2023). With regards to GenAI, while we are cognizant of the potential risks to the dominance of search, we believe that on the range of outcomes, Alphabet remains well positioned through its massive user distribution (9 products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI talent, a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI. During the quarter, Alphabet also held its annual I/O conference, where it provided an update on its efforts in AI including: Gemini is now used by 1.5 million developers; model quality is expanding rapidly (e.g., context window is now 2 million tokens of length); the new genomics model, Alphafold 3 can predict structures of molecules and potentially accelerate drug discovery; new TPU6 AI chips has shown a 4.7 times improvement in compute performance compared to the prior generation; and Gemini for workspace is showing early data on a 30% increase in user productivity. Alphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We continue to believe that the current valuation of Alphabet presents an attractive risk/reward for long-term owners of the business and have therefore increased our position.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL\u00a0ranks 4th\u00a0on our list of Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks.

Despite ongoing antitrust trials, the firm believes the potential negative outcomes are already reflected in Google\u2019s stock price. Pivotal\u2019s forecast for Google is conservative on search but anticipates significant growth in cloud revenue and sees untapped value in its moonshot ventures. The firm set a price target of $215, suggesting a 30% upside for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares.\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year.

According to StatCounter report, Bing search engine\u2019s market share only increased from 3.03% in August 2023 to 3.91% in August 2024.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks among the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio.\nRay Dalio was born in 1949 and graduated from Long Island University in 1971. After a brief stint as a clerk on the New York Stock Exchange, he attended Harvard Business School and earned his MBA in 1973. That same year, he became the Director of Commodities at Dominick & Dominick LLC and later traded futures at Shearson Hayden Stone for a year. Dalio founded\u00a0Bridgewater Associates\u00a0in 1973 in his apartment. In July 2011, he stepped down as CEO but continued to work as a co-CIO alongside Robert Prince and Greg Jensen, taking on the title of \u201cMentor.\u201d\nBridgewater Associates is notable for its focus on transparency and accountability. The firm promotes a culture where team members take responsibility for mistakes and learn from them. It encourages questioning and alignment, ensuring everyone regularly evaluates the validity of their ideas. This approach is crucial to the firm\u2019s management style and investment strategies.\nRay Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, emphasized that since 1945, the United States has been the dominant global empire, but it is now in a state of relative decline. This decline isn\u2019t just an opinion, it\u2019s supported by concrete measures such as the nation\u2019s share of global GDP, military strength, and the quality of its education system. These factors indicate that the U.S. is losing its position.\nIn addition to these, Dalio points out two other key elements that often disrupt world order: natural events like droughts, floods, and pandemics, which have historically caused more damage and upheaval than wars, and human creativity and technological innovation, which bring about substantial changes. Dalio believes all five factors are influencing the U.S. today. However, he stresses that the most critical issue is how people manage these challenges together.\nThe ability to address them intelligently and without creating further conflict is essential. If conflict arises, it could lead to a devastating outcome. But if people can come together and handle the situation effectively, the country can navigate these issues successfully. For Dalio, how society deals with one another is the number one factor in determining the future.\nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Ray Dalio also highlighted significant issues in China that have emerged over the past four years. He explained that China is in need of a major restructuring, as a large portion of individual spending, around 70%, was invested in real estate. With the decline in real estate, stocks, and salaries, people have become more cautious, reducing their spending and holding onto cash. In a deflationary environment, cash has become a relatively safe asset. This situation is affecting both households and businesses.\nDalio also pointed out that the government sector is facing serious challenges. Local governments, responsible for 83% of public spending, previously relied on land sales to generate revenue. With land sales drying up, these governments have accumulated significant debt, and now they\u2019re struggling to pay it off. The key question is how to inject money into these local economies to keep them functioning. Dalio compared the situation to Japan\u2019s struggles in 1990, noting that China\u2019s challenges are even more severe and will require deep restructuring to resolve.\nIn addition to economic concerns, Dalio raised questions about property ownership and values. He referenced Deng Xiaoping\u2019s famous statement, \u201cIt\u2019s glorious to be rich,\u201d and wondered if that sentiment still holds true in China today. The overall environment in the country is becoming more complex and difficult, as these economic and political issues intensify.\nDalio also emphasized the importance of being cautious when investing in China. He made it clear that every country goes through economic cycles, experiencing both highs and lows. According to Dalio, it\u2019s crucial not to invest too heavily in any one country, including China, to avoid having it dominate your portfolio. Despite the challenges China faces, Dalio continues to invest there, but he stressed that the key consideration is the size and structure of the investment. Overall, his experience investing in China has been positive, though careful management is essential.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates\u2019 Q2 2024 13F portfolio and picked the top 10 stocks held by the fund.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI data center stocks.\nThe AI data center industry is experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the massive computational power they require. AI data centers are specialized facilities designed to handle high-intensity AI workloads, including machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network training. These facilities integrate advanced hardware and software to process large-scale data efficiently, creating a crucial infrastructure for the global digital economy. Leading technology companies are making substantial investments in AI data centers. For instance, Meta announced plans to invest $33 billion in data center expansion to support AI research and development. Google is also investing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, committing $3.3 billion in just one region of the United States\u200b. These investments highlight the significance of AI data centers in the broader tech ecosystem.\nAI workloads demand hardware that can process vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This need has led to the development of AI-specific chips, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These chips are essential components in AI data centers.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nWhile AI data centers are essential for technological progress, they consume enormous amounts of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide account for about 1% of global electricity demand, a figure that could increase significantly with the rise of AI. Cooling systems, necessary to maintain optimal hardware performance, further contribute to this energy demand. To address this, companies are increasingly focused on building energy-efficient data centers. For example, Google has implemented machine learning algorithms to reduce energy use in its data centers by 30%.\nThe AI data center industry will continue to evolve as the demand for AI-driven applications grows. Experts predict a significant shift toward edge computing, where data centers are decentralized and located closer to the source of data generation. This reduces latency and improves performance for real-time AI applications such as autonomous driving and smart cities. Moreover, the integration of quantum computing into AI data centers could revolutionize the field. Quantum computers are capable of processing complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers, making them ideal for AI and big data applications. Companies like IBM and Google are already exploring quantum technology in their AI research.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. The company has made several announcements regarding massive investments in AI data centers around the world. In late September, the firm pledged $1 billion towards building a data center in Thailand. At the end of August, Google had announced that it would be investing $850 million to open a data center in Latin America. In addition to these, the firm has also pledged billions towards building data centers in the United Kingdom, Singapore, the US, and Malaysia. The company has also used Arm designs to develop a data center chip that offers industry-leading performance and energy efficiency.\nOverall GOOG ranks 6th on our list of the best AI data center stocks to buy.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Cheap Internet Stocks To Invest In Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other cheap Internet stocks.\nRecently, China\u2019s stock market has seen a sharp rally, driven by some aggressive measures by the government to revive the economy. China is the world\u2019s second-largest economy and one of the key players in the technology industry. This huge economy has faced a series of challenges for the past few years in the shape of a sharp property market downturn and a lack of consumer confidence.\nThe government measures include interest rate cuts and liquidity injection into the market. On September 24, Reuters reported China\u2019s central bank cut bank reserve requirement by 50 basis points and it also reduced interest rate by 20 basis points to 1.5%. Moreover, the bank also plans to issue 2 trillion yuan in special sovereign bonds.\nThese measures resulted in the CSI 300 index trading higher. The index closed 4.5% higher after the announcement whereas the Hong Kong Index gained 3.6%. This move by the Chinese central bank is said to have a positive effect around the globe. Analysts in the United States are already discussing the news as \u201cChina Boost\u201d. While many analysts are calling this boost to be short-lived, others are confident that this is a positive mood and will benefit the market in the long term.\nDavid Tepper, Appaloosa Management founder and president and Carolina Panthers owner joined CNBC for an interview recently to talk about the global impact of the Chinese stimulus.\nWhile drawing a comparison between the Chinese and the United States stock markets, Tepper pointed out that Chinese stocks have been trading at single-digit multiples with earnings expected to grow in double digits for major stocks at least. On the other hand, the United States S&P average is sitting at more than 20 times.\nTepper believes that China has exceeded expectations with the recent move and while quoting the government officials of China he pointed out that they are willing to do more if needed. He further emphasized that the central bank is encouraging buybacks of stocks and they are even lending money to do that at very cheap rates. This is an internal stimulus that is going to encourage consumption and Tepper believes that the Chinese government is doing everything it can to revive the economy.\nWhile talking about the global impact of this move, Tepper mentioned that the European market is already making cuts, the United States market has seen one cut already with more expected during the year, and with the Chinese making cuts Japan is expected to follow suit. Tepper thinks this is a very good scenario for undervalued stocks in China and around the world in general. As an American investor as well, Chinese stocks look cheap when compared to the market average. Moreover, Tepper thinks that the United States is not a cheap market currently, he thinks it is slightly overvalued. Though it is a tough comparison, if you compare the price-to-earnings ratio of global stock markets, the United States will find itself slightly overvalued.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of 7 cheap internet stocks to invest in now we used the Finviz stock screener and ETFs. Using these sources we aggregated a list of 15 internet stocks. From these stocks we selected stocks that are trading below the Forward Price-to-Earning ratio of 23.98 (the market\u2019s forward P/E as per the Wall Street Journal) and earnings expected to grow during the year. Once we had the list of cheap internet stocks, we then ranked them based on the number of hedge funds that held stakes in them in Q2 2024, which we took from Insider Monkey's database of over 900 hedge funds. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nForward P/E Ratio: 21.14\u00a0\nEarnings Growth This Year: 31.90%\u00a0\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the leaders when it comes to internet stocks. At its basics, the company is an international technology hub with operations running in cloud computing, internet search, artificial intelligence, software development, and hardware as well. Its search engine Google has gone on to become a synonym for internet search engine.\nWhile Google continues to maintain it's market-leading position with more than 91% market share, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is continuously developing its AI technology. The company has launched its large language model Gemini to compete in the generative AI race. And has plans to invest more than $50 billion in AI development. The company also runs YouTube, which is a video streaming platform.\nApart from this, its cloud business is also soaring with more than 60% of GenAI startups using its Google Cloud. The cloud revenue of the company grew 28.8% year-over-year during the second quarter of 2024. Overall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was able to grow its revenue by 14% to reach $84.7 billion.\nBy the end of the year, management anticipates the company\u2019s revenue to reach $100 billion. What\u2019s truly impressive is its cheap valuation. GOOGL is trading at a forward P/E of 21 and analysts expect its earnings to grow by 32% during the year, making it one of the cheapest internet stocks to invest in now.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the cheap Internet stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Since Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 3th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nJim Cramer during his October 14 program on CNBC looked excited as he celebrated the rebound of major tech stocks, saying these companies are showing their \u201cstaying power\u201d despite the odds.\n\u201cWe\u2019re back. That\u2019s right. Whatever you want to call them, these big tech plays are demonstrating their staying power no matter what happens.\u201d\nCramer said that the latest earnings season would be critical for the overall market and investor portfolios. He also pointed out the broadening of the rally, saying other groups besides the tech industry are also rebounding.\n\u201cThis rally is not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can work, too, in this market. There\u2019s a lot of money going around, and we know there\u2019s a lot of money coming into the market. The Fed is cutting rates, and friendly cash won\u2019t be worth as much as it was. But the staying power of the Magnificent 7 is truly unbelievable.\u201d\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC and picked 10 important stocks he\u2019s talking about.

As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels. \u00a0With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. According to StatCounter report, Bing search engine\u2019s market share only increased from 3.03% in August 2023 to 3.91% in August 2024. This shows MSFT has not been able to make any notable dent in Google\u2019s market share.\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet\u2019s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts\u2019 forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) \u00a0is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\nOakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) was the top detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-based communication services company\u2019s stock price fell after a U.S. District Court ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining a monopoly in general search engine services via exclusive distribution agreements. We think this case is unlikely to hurt Alphabet\u2019s valuation over the long term as regulations previously en[1]acted in the European Union to address similar issues did not materially erode the company\u2019s market share. We continue to believe that Alphabet is an attractive investment.\u201d\nOverall, Alphabet Inc.

Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%.

        "Author": "  Bob Karr ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list titled 7 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we will look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ranks among the best cheap stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio.\nBorn in 1949, Ray Dalio bought his first stock, Northeast Airlines, at the age of 12. Later, the investment manager graduated from Long Island University in 1971. Before going to Harvard Business School, he spent some time as a clerk on the NYSE. In 1973, he became Director of Commodities at Dominick & Dominick LLC. After working there for 1 year, he then spent one-year trading futures at the brokerage firm of Shearson Hayden Stone before founding\u00a0Bridgewater Associates. He has been serving as co-CIO, a position he shares with Robert Prince and Greg Jensen.\nAs of now, Bridgewater Associates is being tagged as a premier asset management firm, which is focused on delivering unique insight and partnership for the most sophisticated global institutional investors. The firm\u2019s investment process revolves around understanding how the world markets and economies work, leveraging cutting-edge technology to validate timeless and universal investment principles.\nThe broader understanding of the \u201cEconomic Machine \u201d influences Ray Dalio\u2019s investment philosophy. The investment manager believes that understanding the working of the\u00a0economy forms the fundamental part of successful investing. According to him, the economic cycle is divided into 3 main phases: 1) Inflationary, 2) Disinflationary, and 3) Deflationary. The investors must adapt their strategies after considering where the economy is in this cycle. Ray Dalio\u2019s deep understanding of the broader global economy led him to correctly predict Mexico\u2019s 1980s financial crisis, reflecting that he can spot risks and opportunities. He also believes that debt cycles have an important role to play in shaping economic and market conditions.\nRay Dalio realized that the economy tends to move in cycles, fluctuating between periods of growth and decline. This led to the development of the\u00a0\u201cAll Weather\u201d portfolio at Bridgewater Associates, which targets to minimize volatility throughout market environments. According to him, assets like stocks, bonds, and currencies respond differently to broader conditions. This is known as inverse correlation. Therefore, Dalio emphasizes that diversification remains a key in managing risk in an investment portfolio.\nNext, Ray Dalio believes in systematic decision-making. At the time of research, his principles use a very data-driven approach. This means that he conducts research using historical pricing, financial figures, and economic indicators so that market direction can be accurately predicted. He continues to focus on maintaining principle-based decision-making processes, algorithms, and data-driven analysis.\nRay Dalio\u2019s investment principle of \u201cStrategic Selling for Maximum Profit\u201d focuses on the idea of making informed decisions regarding when to sell investments in a bid to maximize the returns while, at the same time, managing risk. As of the end of Q2 2024, Bridgewater Associates has ~21.7% exposure to the services industry, ~19.6% to the\u00a0technology sector, and ~12.1% to the\u00a0consumer goods business.\nSince 2010, while the broader tech sector saw an outsized impact, the US outperformance was broad-based throughout sectors. The US outperformance concerning sales and margin growth was roughly half because of the US tech sector and half as a result of other sectors, while the impact on P/E expansion remained even higher for tech. In contribution terms, Bridgewater Associates stated that technology made up for ~54% of the total 74% US equity outperformance since 2010 as compared to the developed world.\nThe investment firm believes that some of the largest drivers of US equity outperformance should not be relied upon moving forward. The direction of the markets depends on the ability of the US tech to deliver and Al to unleash productivity throughout sectors. This is for both (a) the US Big Tech directly, which now makes up over ~30% of the index and increased expectations, and (b) how the Al/ML technology will help the companies and how much of it gets captured as margins by these companies across the various non-tech sectors.\nOur methodology\nTo list the 7 Best Cheap Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio, we sifted through Bridgewater Associates\u2019 Q2 2024 13F portfolio. After extracting the list of his holdings, we chose the stocks that are trading at a forward earnings multiple of less than ~23.52x (since the broader market trades at a forward earnings multiple of ~23.52x, as per WSJ) and selected the 7 best cheap stocks to buy. Finally, the stocks are ranked in ascending order of the fund\u2019s stakes in them.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nBridgewater Associates\u2019 Stake Value: $827,010,363\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nForward P/E Ratio as of 4 October: 18.94x\nWall Street believes that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s growth momentum is expected to be aided by Google\u2019s Search and Cloud services. Moreover, its innovation in Al and infrastructure leadership should continue to aid its revenues and earnings. The company remains focused on re-engineering its cost base.\nThe analysts have seen positive trends throughout the\u00a0engagement, Al-embedded Search, and GCP. Experts opine that ads business momentum and the growth of its subscriptions business should continue to act as principal tailwinds. Investments will be made towards technical infrastructure and cloud growth.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s strong competitive positioning, supplemented by its dominant core search business, is expected to further strengthen user inclination moving forward. The company\u2019s prospects are further cemented by its potential to lead in consumer Al assistant use, considering the widespread global device presence. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u2019s prowess in Al and its financial strength enable it to\u00a0provide greater financial incentives to handset manufacturers to go for default Al placement.\nWall Street believes that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains well-placed to achieve healthy financial growth and generate a reasonable Al return on invested capital (ROIC), even if the development of Al revenue-generating applications might take longer than expected. Recently, the company highlighted that new products and features in Google Cloud and YouTube continue to attract partnerships and increase paid subscribers.\nWolfe Research initiated coverage on the shares of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on 16th\u00a0July. The firm gave an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating with a price target of $240.00.\nPatient Capital Management, a value investing firm, released its second quarter 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\u201d\nOverall GOOGL ranks 1st on our list of best cheap stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 15 AI Stocks That Are On Sale. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks that are on sale.\nBig tech, specifically artificial intelligence, is the sector that many are starting to consider as the best-performing sector of the market in the second quarter of 2024. The concentration of the major players in this space has been in the large-cap companies since your ability to fully develop AI and benefit from its profitability really depends on the scale of your business. Basically, the bigger a company is, the better it will be positioned within the AI-led market this year. Because of this phenomenon, big tech companies, with all the money in the world to invest in AI development, are ensuring that this revolutionary tech drives the overall tech sector to record highs in 2024.\nAccording to Alex Kantrowitz, Founder of Big Technology, these trends can be expected to lift up other sectors in the market that have a strong relationship with AI. One such sector is energy, which, according to Kantrowitz, is going to be seeing a lot more demand from customers that are developing AI and creating and training Large Language Models. While many players in the AI space today are also working on finding ways to use energy for AI development more efficiently, the general consensus seems to be that there\u2019s a need to tap into more existing sources of energy until such methods are found. Because of this, the markets may see demand for nuclear energy rise to unprecedented levels as well.\nAnother sector that might catch the AI draft and be propelled higher is digital advertising. With the rise of AI-powered marketing clouds, many advertisement-focused businesses are beginning to see immense increases in their return on investment. According to David Steinberg, the CEO of Zeta Global, AI is leading to immense growth within the advertising ecosystem, with Steinberg expecting growth in low double-digits this year. He noted that the launch of ChatGPT was the \u201cbig renaissance moment\u201d for AI, which changed our perception of this technology from being a figment of science fiction to something serious enough to be discussed in company board rooms. Because of this, Steinberg believes that every company out there in advertisement and retail is pivoting its business to incorporate high-quality enterprise AI usages in its operations.\nPart of the reason why AI is taking over the market in this manner is the promise it makes \u2013 efficiency coupled with revenue growth. By focusing on AI development and integration, businesses across the globe can increase their efficiency while also generating higher profits for themselves and their shareholders. Considering this, and the fact that AI stocks have been performing exceptionally well in the second quarter, we have compiled a list of some AI stocks on sale that investors may wish to consider for their portfolios this year.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nWe first compiled a list of 40 AI stocks by sifting through ETFs and online rankings, including our own rankings. We then selected the 15 stocks with P/E ratios lower than the S&P 500\u2019s P/E of 24.1 as of September 27 (according to data from WSJ) and with expected EPS growth for this year. The stocks are ranked based on their P/E ratios, from the highest to the lowest. We also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock, as of the second quarter.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 165\nExpected Earnings Growth: 31.9%\nP/E Ratio: 21.6\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a big tech company offering interactive media and communication services. It is based in Mountain View, California. The company is an active player and pioneer in the AI space is also behind Gemini, a major Large Language Model. Moreover, its Google Cloud Platform is among the top choices for enterprises and developers for building AI and ML applications.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a company with immense financial fortitude since it has managed to generate significant profits since its IPO 20 years ago. The company reported $23.5 billion in net income in the second quarter alone, which translated to a net profit margin of 28%. With this much financial stability, the company\u2019s involvement in the AI space has made many investors consider it among the top AI stocks to buy.\nToday, almost all of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOG) products and services have AI integrated into them. A few examples of its existing AI-enhanced offerings include Google Maps, YouTube, Gmail, and the Google Cloud. With plans to invest at least $12 billion per quarter on capital expenditures, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is expected to take its AI integration even further to its own and its shareholders\u2019 benefit.\nConsidering these factors, the company\u2019s current valuation and P/E ratio of merely 23.5 points makes Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) quite a steal in the AI market today.\nThere were 165 hedge funds long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $22.01 billion.\nDiamond Hill Capital\u00a0mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second-quarter 2024 investor\u00a0letter:\n\u201cAmong our top individual contributors in Q2 were Amazon, Texas Instruments and\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). Media and technology company Alphabet also continued delivering strong results in its search, YouTube advertising, YouTube subscription and cloud businesses. Shares rose amid an environment that continues favoring mega-cap technology companies.\u201d\nOverall GOOG ranks 14th on our list of AI stocks that are on sale. While GOOG is an exceptional investment, we believe that AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report? Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry, could be a great candidate to consider.\nThis company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 14.50%.\nFor the most recent quarter, Alphabet was expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share, but it reported $1.89 per share instead, representing a surprise of 2.16%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.49 per share, while it actually produced $1.89 per share, a surprise of 26.85%.\nFor Alphabet, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nAlphabet currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.13%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner.\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Consumer internet companies are playing a key role in lives being transformed, simplified and made more accessible.\nThe 49 consumer internet stocks we track reported a mixed Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 2.5% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was in line.\nThe Fed cut its policy rate by 50bps (half a percent) in September 2024, the first in roughly four years. This marks the end of its most pointed inflation-busting campaign since the 1980s. While CPI (inflation) readings have been supportive lately, employment measures have bordered on worrisome. The markets will be assessing whether this rate cut's timing (and more potential ones in 2024 and 2025) is ideal for supporting the economy or a bit too late for a macro that has already cooled too much.\nLuckily, consumer internet stocks have performed well with share prices up 10.8% on average since the latest earnings results.\nStarted by Stanford students Larry Page and Sergey Brin in a Menlo Park garage, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the parent company of the eponymous Google Search engine, Google Cloud Platform, and YouTube.\nAlphabet reported revenues of $84.74 billion, up 13.6% year on year. This print was in line with analysts\u2019 expectations, but overall, it was a mixed quarter for the company: Revenue slightly beat expectations despite a miss in the YouTube segment revenue. In addition, operating income and EPS beat by more convincing amounts.\nUnsurprisingly, the stock is down 10.1% since reporting and currently trades at $163.38.\nIs now the time to buy Alphabet?

The business had an incredible quarter with optimistic revenue guidance for the next quarter and exceptional revenue growth.\nAlthough it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 18.3% since reporting. It currently trades at $19.60.\nIs now the time to buy EverQuote?

It was a disappointing quarter as it posted a decline in its users and a miss of analysts\u2019 user estimates.\nSkillz delivered the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group. The company reported 122,000 monthly active users, down 37.8% year on year. As expected, the stock is down 11.5% since the results and currently trades at $5.60.\nRead our full analysis of Skillz\u2019s results here. \nFounded by consignment store aficionado Julie Wainwright, The RealReal (NASDAQ: REAL) is an online marketplace for buying and selling secondhand luxury goods.\nThe RealReal reported revenues of $144.9 million, up 10.8% year on year. This print surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations by 3.6%. Aside from that, it was a slower quarter as it logged a miss of analysts\u2019 user estimates and slow revenue growth.\nThe company reported 381,000 users, up 8.5% year on year.

The fund returned 8.07% in the third quarter compared to a 5.89% return for the S&P 500 Index. The fund returned 11.76% since its inception compared to the index\u2019s return of 9.82% over the same period. The largest contributing sectors were real estate and financials while the energy sector was the only detractor from performance. In addition, you can check the fund\u2019s top 5 holdings to determine its best picks for 2024.\nOakmark Select Fund highlighted stocks like Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, offers various platforms and services operating through Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. The one-month return of Alphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\"Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was the top detractor during the quarter. The U.S.-based communication services company\u2019s stock price fell after a U.S. District Court ruled that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by maintaining a monopoly in general search engine services via exclusive distribution agreements. We think this case is unlikely to hurt Alphabet\u2019s valuation over the long term as regulations previously en[1]acted in the European Union to address similar issues did not materially erode the company\u2019s market share.

Since Alphabet Inc\u00a0 (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0Ken Fisher\u00a0regularly shares his investing wisdom on his YouTube channel, sharing market insights and lessons he\u2019s learned over the decades. Commenting about the Fed\u2019s rate cut, Fisher recently advised investors not to focus on what the central bank is doing and instead pay attention to long-term investing.\n\u201cThe fact is, and I\u2019ve said this for a long time, I won\u2019t live forever, but I hope to live a long time and keep saying it: central bankers are crazy. Throughout my life, central banks have operated on flawed ideas and groupthink, which is an inefficient way to manage markets.\u201d\nFisher gave an example of how you could end up losing money following the herd mentality when it comes to central bank moves.\n\u201cIf you had followed the common belief that when the Fed and other central banks hike rates, you should get out of stocks, that would have worked for a couple of months in 2022. By the middle of the summer of 2022, during the height of rate hikes, you would have been on the wrong side of the market. From June 2022 onward, as the Fed hiked rates by 75 basis points nearly every month, the market was just a few months away from rising, leading to the bull market we\u2019re in now, in 2024.\nFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher\u2019s hedge fund\u2019s Q2 holdings and picked its top AI investments. We have analyzed the AI-related growth catalysts for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nBillionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s Stake: $8,856,226,893\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels. \u00a0With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market. According to StatCounter report, Bing search engine\u2019s market share only increased from 3.03% in August 2023 to 3.91% in August 2024. This shows MSFT has not been able to make any notable dent in Google\u2019s market share.\nCloud and YouTube are two key strong catalysts for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares. During the second quarter, Alphabet\u2019s Cloud revenue rose 28.8% to $10.35 billion, crushing past analysts\u2019 forecasts of $10.16 billion. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) \u00a0is on the path to reach a $100 billion revenue run-rate from YouTube Ads and Google Cloud by the end of 2024.\nPershing Square Holdings stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, delivered stellar business results in the first half of 2024. Revenues grew 14% powered by Google\u2019s dominant position in the fast-growing digital advertising market as well as certain company-specific tailwinds including the increasing adoption of AI automation tools by advertisers and YouTube\u2019s continued success in the Connected TV Medium. Strong revenue growth coupled with cost control initiatives and stable staffing levels (headcount has remained flat year-to-date), resulted in strong operating leverage. Operating profit margins expanded approximately 340 basis points, excluding one-time severance and real estate charges. In the second quarter, the company\u2019s Cloud segment outpaced its major competitors with 29% revenue growth and achieved 11% profit margins, after first reaching profitability just 18 months ago.\nOverall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Billionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +4.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 9.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.64 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.7%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.64 indicates a change of +13.1% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $72.77 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.6%. The $296.54 billion and $330.45 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15.6% and +11.4%, respectively.\nAlphabet reported revenues of $71.36 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.44 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $70.6 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.07%. The EPS surprise was +2.16%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Seth Klarman Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other stocks in Seth Klarman's portfolio.\nSeth Klarman, the founder and CEO of Baupost Group, is a prominent figure in the investment industry, with his hedge fund ranking as the 12th largest globally. Renowned for his insightful investment strategies, Klarman is also the author of Margin of Safety, a highly respected book that outlines his philosophy on value investing and is known for its scarcity and high resale value, often fetching prices over $1,500.\nAfter earning his MBA from Harvard Business School, Klarman was recruited by his professor, Bill Poorvu, to help manage investments, marking the beginning of a successful career in finance. His approach emphasizes thorough analysis and a disciplined perspective, setting him apart in a competitive market. Poorvu, along with his partners, Howard Stevenson, Jordan Baruch, and Isaac Auerbach, formed the company name Baupost from their last names. This decision did not reflect a desire to exclude Klarman but rather preserved the initial branding of the firm. When Baupost launched in 1982, it had an impressive initial capital of $27 million, a substantial sum at the time.\nThe founders initially intended to distribute this capital among multiple money managers; however, they struggled to find other conservative managers who fit their investment style, leading to Klarman being entrusted with the entire amount. His approach to investing was distinctly conservative, which later became a hallmark of his strategy. Klarman is also the author of the influential book Margin of Safety, which provides insights into his investment principles and has become highly sought after by investors, with copies sometimes selling for over $1,500.\nSeth Klarman observes that the current investment landscape resembles an \"everything bubble,\" characterized by an influx of money across various asset classes. This phenomenon has been fueled by historically low interest rates, some even hitting zero. Alongside this, technological advancements have accelerated, leading to disruptions in numerous industries, which presents both challenges and opportunities for investors. He appeared on CNBC in June 2023 where he said:\n\"The first thing is, I think we've been in an everything bubble. A lot of money has flowed into virtually everything. Historic low interest rates, even zero rates, have precipitated that bubble. You\u2019ve also had a lot of changes in the business world; technology has accelerated if anything, and you\u2019ve seen disruption in all kinds of businesses, which creates challenges and opportunities for investors.\"\nKlarman noted that certain asset classes, particularly private credit, have gained significant attention during this period. He highlights that speculation has surged in various areas, from cryptocurrencies to meme stocks and SPACs, emphasizing the need for investors to be mindful of the risks associated with speculation and to understand the context of the current environment.\n\"Some asset classes have become increasingly popular; private credit has had its day in the sun. You've had speculation during that bubble in all kinds of things, from crypto to meme stocks to SPACs, in a way that has some important reminders for people about the dangers of speculation and the importance of remembering what kind of environment you\u2019re in.\"\nSeth Klarman believes that the traditional academic definition of value investing, which focuses on buying the cheapest stocks based on numerical analysis, is too simplistic. Instead, he views the market through a broader lens. He suggests that all stocks can have value, but they can also be overvalued. To navigate this complexity, investors need a clear framework or set of guidelines to assess the value of various assets and businesses, helping them identify which ones are mis-priced. Here are some comments from his CNBC interview from back in Q2 2023:\n\"The academic definition of value is to buy the stock that\u2019s cheapest by the numbers... The way I think about the market is not that there are growth stocks and value stocks, but rather that all stocks may hold value but that all stocks also could potentially be overvalued. You have to have a mechanism, a rubric, for figuring out the value of different kinds of assets, different kinds of businesses to identify which ones are trading particularly mispriced.\"\nIn today's rapidly changing market, Klarman emphasizes the importance of looking beyond current earnings. He warns that today's earnings may not be sustainable; a business could face disruption or even become obsolete, but conversely, its value could increase significantly. Therefore, a forward-thinking approach is crucial for investors, allowing them to adapt to evolving market conditions while identifying long-term opportunities.\n\"In a world that\u2019s changing as fast as this one, it\u2019s really important to think about not just what are the earnings today. The earnings may not be here tomorrow. the business might be disrupted. the business may be gone, or they could be 50% to 100% more.\"\nOur Methodology\nThis article examines the top 10 stock holdings of Baupost Group for the second quarter of 2024, detailing the fund's investments and the number of other hedge funds involved with these companies during the same period. The stocks are organized in ascending order based on the stake Baupost Group held in each, as of June 30, 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Discovery (WBD), and Best Buy (BBY). The six primary uses of AI agents employed by enterprises include customer agents, employee agents, code agents, data agents, security agents, and creative agents.\nGoogle reported that over 2 million developers are building with Google\u2019s GenAI solutions, and it has seen 36x growth in Gemini API usage on Vertex AI since the beginning of the year. \u201cGoogle is well positioned to drive adoption of generative AI tools given its AI-optimized compute infrastructure supported by custom silicon, and unmatched breadth of data to develop and train AI models across text, images, and video,\u201d Devitt noted.\nWedbush maintains its Outperform rating on Google with a 12-month price target of $205, about 26% higher than the current stock price.\nDespite constant alarms going off about its search business, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) search revenue jumped about 13.7% in the second quarter year over year. As of the end of June, Google has about 91.06% share of the search engine market, just 1.65% lower than the December 2019 levels. \u00a0With AI overviews and other search initiatives, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to stave off any competitors given its dominance in the market.

This interest was sparked by the blockbuster launch of ChatGPT by California-based OpenAI in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has raised tens of billions of dollars in new funding and reached a valuation of over $150 billion. OpenAI revealed earlier this week that it had secured more than $6.6 billion in new funding through a financing round led by prominent names including Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, and Tiger Global, among others.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nPerhaps one reason the startup is so popular is that it is projecting more than $3.5 billion in revenue this year and over $11 billion in 2025. AI startups in general have been quicker at making revenues than previous technology booms, according to an analysis of payment information by fintech firm Stripe. The report underlines that top AI groups are reaching millions of dollars in sales within a year. This timeline is far faster in the life cycle of a startup than comparable non-AI tech groups. The report relies on annual revenue data for the 100 highest-grossing privately held AI companies using Stripe, compared with a comparable basket of prominent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) start-ups as of July 2018.\nThe report has gained a lot of traction since Stripe customers include OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, GitHub and Midjourney, among others. Stripe claims, per Financial Times, that AI start-ups took a median 11 months to hit $1 million in annual revenue after their first sales on Stripe, compared with 15 months for the previous generation of SaaS companies. AI start-ups that have scaled to more than $30 million in annual revenue achieved the milestone in 20 months \u2014 five times faster than past SaaS companies.

        "Title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Alphabet 5 Years From Now",
        "Author": "  Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet is one of the world's largest companies. With a market cap of $2 trillion, there are only a handful of stocks that can compete with its size.\nHowever, there are companies that could grow even larger than Alphabet within the next five years. Here, I'll cover two that could pull off that feat: Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\nAs of this writing, Meta Platforms' market cap\u00a0stands at about $1.5 trillion. That trails Alphabet by a little more than $500 billion.\nYet while Meta is only 75% the size of Alphabet, I think it could overtake its rival in the very near future. Here's why.\nFirst, Meta is enormous. The company can claim nearly 3.3 billion daily active users (DAUs) across its platforms, which include Facebook and Instagram. That means more than a third of the global population uses\u00a0Meta's platform regularly.\nAccordingly, given the size of its user base, the company reaps an enormous windfall in terms of ad revenue. In its most recently reported quarter, Meta tallied $38.3 billion in ad revenue. That works out to about $425 million per day.\nTrue, Alphabet makes even more in ad revenue right now, but it's facing some challenges in its key category of internet search. That's to say nothing of the recent federal antitrust ruling that labeled the company a monopoly.\nIn short, Meta's bread and butter is ad revenue, and it's an area that is not only highly lucrative -- Meta's operating margin is a stout 38% -- it's growing like a weed. The company's overall revenue grew by 22% in its most recent quarter, despite its size.\nIn other words, Meta has plenty of gas in the tank to catch Alphabet by 2029 -- if not sooner.\nIf Meta still has a sizable gap to overtake Alphabet, Amazon has only a tiny crack. As of this writing, Amazon's market cap of $1.9 trillion trails Alphabet's market cap by about $100 billion, or roughly 5%.\nIndeed, during the past 10 years, these two companies have traded places several times, with Alphabet holding a steady lead from 2014-2018. Amazon edged ahead from 2018-2022, only to see Alphabet retake the lead in recent years.\nHowever, I think Amazon will not only retake the lead, but move significantly ahead of Alphabet during the next five years. The main reason why is that Amazon is starting to hit its stride under Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy, who took over from Jeff Bezos in 2021.\nThree years into the job, Jassy is putting his own mark on Amazon, starting with the company's increased efficiency. As of its most recently reported quarter, Amazon's operating margin climbed to almost 10%.

        "Text": "By Abhirup Roy\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet's Waymo will add electric vehicles from South Korea's Hyundai Motor to its robotaxi fleet, the companies said on Friday, as Waymo expands in the United States.\nOn-road testing for IONIQ 5 SUVs - assembled at Hyundai's Georgia facility and equipped with Waymo's autonomous technology - will begin by late 2025, they said.\nWaymo has about 700 vehicles in its fleet and is the only U.S. firm operating uncrewed robotaxis that collect fares.\nThe partnership with Hyundai comes days before Tesla CEO Elon Musk is set to unveil plans for a robotaxi product that is expected to use a custom-built vehicle. Musk may also discuss plans for his company to run a ride-hailing platform that will allow Tesla owners to list their vehicles when not in use.\nWaymo now uses I-PACE vehicles from Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India's Tata Motors. Waymo is also testing its technology using vehicles from Zeekr, the EV brand of China's Geely. A spokesperson for Waymo said the Hyundai partnership will not directly replace any of its current vehicle platforms.\nThis year, Waymo opened its service to everyone in San Francisco, without the need to join a waitlist, while expanding its operations in metro Phoenix. It also extended services to the San Francisco Peninsula and to certain parts of Los Angeles.\n\"The team at our new manufacturing facility is ready to allocate a significant number of vehicles for the Waymo One fleet as it continues to expand,\" Jose Munoz, global COO of Hyundai Motor said in a statement. \"We are actively exploring additional opportunities for collaboration.\"\nDespite widespread skepticism, tight regulatory scrutiny and federal investigations on AV technology, Alphabet said this year it was planning a multi-year $5 billion investment in Waymo.\nIn August, Waymo said it had doubled its paid rides to 100,000 per week in just over three months as it expanded its areas of service and allowed more people to ride its robotaxis.\nOthers in the race include General Motors' Cruise, which is testing cars with human safety drivers after an accident last year led it to pull all vehicles from the road, and Amazon's Zoox, which is expanding testing for its vehicles built without steering wheels and pedals.\n(Reporting by Abhirup Roy in San Francisco; Editing by Peter Henderson and Jacqueline Wong)\n"

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks.\nCompanies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to meet the growing demands of machine learning, data processing, and AI-driven applications. This spending is largely concentrated on building data centers, acquiring specialized hardware, and optimizing cloud infrastructure. According to a report by McKinsey, global AI infrastructure spending could reach up to $500 billion by 2027, highlighting the critical role it plays in the future of AI development. A large part of this investment is focused on AI-specific hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are crucial for training and deploying AI models. NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI chips, has seen demand for its GPUs soar, largely due to their centrality in deep learning tasks. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, has remarked that the AI boom is underpinned by massive infrastructure needs, and the market is just at the beginning of this growth curve.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nData centers are another focal point for AI infrastructure spending. AI workloads are highly demanding, requiring specialized facilities that can support high-density computing environments. Blackstone\u2019s $16 billion acquisition of AirTrunk, a leader in AI-driven data centers, underscores the increasing importance of such infrastructure. The deal will add 800 MW of data center capacity, with projections to grow beyond 1 GW, a testament to the rising demand for infrastructure to support AI-driven applications. Cloud infrastructure is also a major area where companies are pouring resources. Cloud giants are increasing their investments in AI infrastructure. These companies are developing new AI-optimized cloud services to cater to businesses adopting AI. Gartner predicts that by 2026, cloud AI infrastructure spending will surpass $200 billion, as enterprises increasingly shift from on-premise AI deployments to scalable cloud-based solutions.\nThomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, recently remarked that AI is unlocking entirely new revenue streams for enterprises, and cloud infrastructure is the backbone enabling this transformation. Beyond just hardware, organizations are also investing in data management platforms and storage solutions to handle the massive amounts of data AI systems require. In fact, estimates suggest that the global AI data infrastructure market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18%, driven by increased data volumes and the need for real-time data processing capabilities. Companies are significantly ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, focusing on hardware, data centers, and cloud computing.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.\nUS technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk.\nWhile tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nThis has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave \u2014 particularly in software and cloud services.\nTheir scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants.\nLet's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\u00a0stands against the other widely held stocks.\nThe last trading day of September is upon us and so are many questions about the market. On September 30, Dana D\u2019Auria, Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the financial market.\nD'Auria regards employment data to be a major concern at the moment. Since inflation rates are subsiding, employment data is something investors should be on the lookout for, along with other data points including GDP and consumer confidence. She suggests that to ensure a soft landing, the Fed must initiate larger rate cuts, and that recessionary conditions are out of the picture.\nSeptember is notoriously volatile along with October, and, with elections in another 35 days, the conditions may be slightly different or even more turbulent. According to D'Auria, the 50 basis point cut is a catch-up for July, and expecting a 50 basis point cut in November is borderline questionable.\nOverall, she believes that the market has been overshooting and we may have to settle for two 25 basis point cuts before the end of 2024. She reiterates that the job market is crucial and investors must get out of their comfort zone to invest in non-cash opportunities. Investors concerned about low-risk options may consider equities in the defensive sectors that are innately low volatile.\nWall Street is heading to close September and Q3 on a high note and stocks have experienced their best September in over a decade. On September 30, Kevin Gordon, harles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis.\nGordon believes that stocks in the utilities and defensive sectors have caught up to tech stocks amid the AI boom, compared to their financials at the end of FY 2023. However, he does acknowledge that sectors like industrials, financials, and materials are performing relatively well, calling it a case of market broadening.\nIn terms of market breadth, most sectors are experiencing an upward trajectory. Almost 81% of the S&P 500 members are experiencing an uptrend, despite the quality bias investors may have towards certain stocks. According to Gordon, large-cap quality stocks will continue to perform well despite the volatility and the Fed's decisions. Speaking of smaller-cap stocks, he believes that some stocks may struggle a bit especially when it comes to earnings growth.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 most widely held stocks by hedge funds, we sifted through Insider Monkey's database that tracks over 900 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. We ranked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 216\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. The company owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo.\nThe company is relentlessly working to improve the Gemini experience and is also actively involved in developing AI hardware, having launched its NVIDIA chip rival in May. While Google\u2019s tensor processing units (TPU) only account for almost 20% of the market, its advancements promise higher market shares. In addition to that, its six-generation chips are 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of processors. It is to be noted that the company intends to spend $50 billion by the end of 2024 to enhance its position in AI.\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) logged revenue worth $85 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, driven by the growing momentum in cloud and search. Additionally, over 60% of generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud. One can infer that the technology giant is well-positioned to exploit the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment.\nAnalysts are bullish on GOOGL and their 12-month median price target of $204.5 points to a 24% upside from current levels. Overall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). According to the Insider Monkey database, Fisher Asset Management\u00a0was the highest stakeholder with a position of $8.86 billion.\nPatient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\"Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google\u2019s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.\"\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks.\nInvestors have been looking for smart ways to play the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has swept the global financial markets over the past two years. Most of the attention in this regard has been confined to obvious choices in semiconductors, software, and biotechnology. Even within these sectors, prominent companies and their AI initiatives have dominated headlines. However, there are several hidden gems within these sectors that offer the same bang for the buck, given present macro context, but are not in limelight as such. For example, Bernie Ahkong, an analyst at UBS, recently noted that the first phase of AI was interest towards chipmakers. In the second phase, investors moved towards the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centers. The present tilt towards utility and power firms is quite possibly the third phase of this AI focus.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nA recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute.

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Serve Robotics, which delivers food for Uber Eats using sidewalk robots, said it would partner with Alphabet-owned Wing Aviation to use drones, extending the operational range to more than six miles.\nThe pilot, announced on Tuesday, would take place in Dallas, Texas, and mark Serve's entry into the market. The tie-up will have Serve's robots pick up food from restaurants and transfer it to Wing drones for aerial delivery.\nThe company's operations have so far focused on Los Angeles, where it delivers food and groceries for convenience retailer 7-Eleven and Shake Shack, in addition to Uber Eats.\nMulti-modal delivery will expand Serve's reach, enabling 30-minute autonomous delivery citywide, Serve's CEO Ali Kashani said.\nWhile drones were once touted to be the future of package and food delivery, their adoption has been limited by a lack of spaces for takeoff and landing in cities. Unlike them, sidewalk delivery robots are designed to navigate urban environments, making them a more practical solution.\n\"Through this pilot partnership, Wing hopes to reach more merchants in highly congested areas while supporting Serve as it works to expand its delivery radius,\" Wing CEO Adam Woodworth said.\nServe, spun off from Postmates in 2021 a year after its acquisition by Uber, said merchants would not have to make any changes to their workflow or facilities to accommodate robot-to-drone deliveries.\nThe Alphabet unit, which started as a project within incubator Google X, has completed more than 400,000 commercial deliveries across three continents, Woodworth added.\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Vijay Kishore)\n"

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the biggest secular tailwinds in recent years is the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). The latest advancements in AI went viral early last year, and the list of companies in the $1 trillion club is littered with businesses on the leading edge of this next-generation technology.\nFor example, Apple products -- including Siri and Maps -- have always embraced AI, while Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have developed seemingly impenetrable moats by integrating AI deeply into their respective business operations. Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have developed the chips that make AI possible.\nNetflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) is one of the pioneers of AI, using cutting-edge algorithms to inform its streaming recommendations and production choices, yet the company has fallen out of favor with some who are busy chasing the latest shiny new thing. Investors might be surprised to learn that Netflix just delivered another quarter of double-digit growth. With a market cap of just $324 billion, it might seem premature to suggest Netflix is bucking to join its peers in the trillion-dollar club, yet the stock has gained more than 100% over the past year and 1,380% over the past decade, and the evidence suggests its ascent will continue.\nNetflix just reported its third-quarter results and sailed past expectations on every important metric. Revenue of $9.83 billion climbed 15% year over year, generating robust profit growth as earnings per share (EPS) of $5.40 soared 45%. Revenue was fueled by strong paid subscriber growth that jumped by more than 5 million, an increase of 14%. The bottom line was driven higher by an expanding operating margin that increased by an incredible 720 basis points to 29.6%.\nFor context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $9.77 billion and EPS of $5.12, accompanied by subscriber additions of 4.5 million, so Netflix beat across the board.\nPerhaps more importantly, management expects its growth streak to continue. Netflix is guiding for fourth-quarter revenue of $10.1 billion, up nearly 15%, while EPS of $4.23 would more than double.\nOn the conference call to discuss the results, Netflix laid out plans to continue its impressive growth, highlighting three particularly significant opportunities.\nNetflix has been dabbling in video games for some time now, but the company is beginning to see greater interest from its audience for the games based on the company's growing library of intellectual property. Management is particularly excited about the title based on Squid Game, the company's most-watched series.\nManagement is also leaning into its recent successes with live events. Netflix is live-streaming a boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul on Nov. 15. The company also has exclusive rights to two NFL games on Christmas Day: The Super Bowl LVII-winning Kansas City Chiefs vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Baltimore Ravens vs. the Houston Texans. Finally, Netflix is the new home of WWE Raw, the highly rated wrestling entertainment show, with weekly episodes beginning in January 2025.\nHowever, the company's biggest opportunity is its growing digital advertising business. Netflix noted during the call that its audience and ad inventory are currently growing faster than the company's ability to capitalize on that growth. Members signing up for the lowest-priced ad tier increased 35% quarter over quarter and accounted for 50% of new members in the countries where Netflix shows advertising.\nThe company has a couple of important initiatives that are designed to accelerate its ads business. First, Netflix is launching its first-party ad server, beginning in Canada this quarter, then in the rest of its advertising markets in 2025. The company is also leaning into its partnership with The Trade Desk to expand its advertising reach. Netflix noted that ad-tier members are similar to other subscribers in terms of hours watched and preferred titles, which shows viewing patterns are consistent. Management expects ad revenue to double (off a small base) in 2025.\nEach of these initiatives represents an incremental growth driver, which helps illustrate how Netflix plans to continue its robust growth.\nNetflix currently has a market cap of $323 billion, which means it will take stock price gains of roughly 207% to drive its value to $1 trillion, but there's a clear path for growth over the coming decade. According to Wall Street, Netflix is expected to generate revenue of $38.74 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 8. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Netflix would have to grow its revenue to roughly $357 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nWall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth for Netflix of about 26% annually over the next five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $1 trillion market cap as soon as 2035. It's worth noting that Netflix has grown its annual revenue by 562% over the past decade, and its net income has soared 1,450%, so Wall Street's outlook could well be conservative. Furthermore, as this quarter illustrates, Netflix has a habit of outpacing Wall Street's expectations, which could also shave years off this timeline.\nFinally, Netflix is currently selling for roughly 39 times earnings, which might seem expensive at first glance, but consider this: Wall Street expects Netflix to generate EPS of $23.11 in 2025, which would represent a multiple of 30 -- the same as the S&P 500. Considering Netflix's strong track record of growth and its significant opportunity, I'd say that's a fair price to pay for a company expected to generate consistent double-digit growth over the next five years.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?
