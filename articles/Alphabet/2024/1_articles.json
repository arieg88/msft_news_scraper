        "Text": "Alphabet Inc's robust financial performance with significant growth in revenues and net income.\nStrategic investments in AI and other technologies positioning the company for future growth.\nIncreasing regulatory scrutiny and competitive pressures present ongoing challenges.\nOpportunities in diversifying revenue streams beyond advertising to mitigate risks.\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google and a host of other subsidiaries, has released its 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The filing provides a comprehensive view of the company's financial health and strategic direction. With an aggregate market value of shares held by non-affiliates at approximately $1,331.2 billion as of June 30, 2023, and a significant reduction in depreciation expense due to a change in the estimated useful life of servers and network equipment, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) demonstrates strong financial fundamentals. The company's continued investment in AI and other innovative technologies, along with its commitment to diversifying revenue streams beyond advertising, positions it well for sustained growth. However, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also faces challenges, including heightened regulatory scrutiny and intense competition in the tech industry.\nFinancial Robustness and Market Dominance: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) continues to exhibit financial strength, with a substantial increase in net income attributed to strategic adjustments in asset depreciation. The company's market capitalization, exceeding $1.3 trillion, underscores its dominant position in the tech industry. Alphabet's core business, Google, contributes to 99% of its revenue, with a significant portion derived from online advertising. This financial robustness provides Alphabet with the flexibility to invest in long-term growth initiatives and withstand economic fluctuations.\nInnovation and AI Leadership: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has established itself as a pioneer in AI, with its \"AI-first\" approach driving innovation across its product portfolio. The company's commitment to integrating AI capabilities into new and existing products and services is a testament to its forward-thinking strategy. This focus on AI not only enhances Alphabet's current offerings but also positions it to capitalize on future technological advancements.\nDependence on Advertising Revenue: Despite its diversified portfolio, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains heavily reliant on advertising revenue, which accounted for more than 75% of its total revenues in 2023. This dependence makes Alphabet vulnerable to fluctuations in advertising spend, which can be influenced by economic conditions and changes in advertiser preferences. Additionally, initiatives to phase out third-party cookies and the rise of ad-blocking technologies pose risks to Alphabet's advertising business model.\nOperational Complexity and Regulatory Challenges: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) operates in a complex regulatory environment, with increasing scrutiny from governments worldwide. The evolving landscape of AI, data privacy, and content moderation regulations could impose constraints on Alphabet's operations and necessitate changes in business practices. These regulatory challenges not only increase operational complexity but also pose potential financial and reputational risks.\nExpansion Beyond Advertising: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has the opportunity to further diversify its revenue streams beyond advertising. The company's investments in cloud services, consumer subscription-based products, and hardware such as smartphones and home devices present avenues for growth. By capitalizing on these opportunities, Alphabet can reduce its reliance on advertising revenue and tap into new markets.\nEmerging Markets and Technological Advancements: The ongoing shift from offline to online and the increasing internet usage in developing economies present significant growth opportunities for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL). By leveraging its technological prowess and expanding its global footprint, Alphabet can capture a larger share of these emerging markets. Additionally, the company's focus on AI and other cutting-edge technologies positions it to lead in the next wave of tech innovation.\nIntense Competition and Market Dynamics: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) faces fierce competition from established tech giants and emerging startups. Competitors may innovate faster or offer similar or superior products and services, which could erode Alphabet's market share. The rapid pace of technological change and shifting user preferences require Alphabet to continuously innovate to maintain its competitive edge.\nCybersecurity and Data Privacy Concerns: As a global technology leader, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a prime target for cyber threats and data breaches. Security incidents can lead to significant legal, financial, and reputational harm. Additionally, the company's extensive data collection practices are subject to increasing privacy concerns and regulatory actions, which could impact user trust and business operations.\nIn conclusion, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) exhibits a strong financial foundation and a commitment to innovation, particularly in AI, which are key strengths that position the company for continued success. However, its reliance on advertising revenue and the complex regulatory environment present notable weaknesses. Opportunities for growth lie in diversifying revenue sources and expanding into emerging markets, while threats include intense competition and cybersecurity risks. As Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) navigates these dynamics, its strategic investments and adaptability will be crucial in shaping its future trajectory.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "3 Reasons to Buy Alphabet Stock in 2024",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares in Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) are up 58% year over year, rallying Wall Street with an expansion in artificial intelligence (AI) and significant ad-revenue growth.\nAs the home of potent brands like Google, Android, Chrome, and YouTube, Alphabet has become a tech behemoth. Its various services attract billions of users, enabling the company to build a lucrative digital-advertising business. Meanwhile, its massive user base will likely prove a major asset in succeeding in AI.\nThe company is on a promising growth trajectory and has some exciting developments in the new year. So, here are three reasons to buy Alphabet stock in 2024.\nInterest in AI has skyrocketed over the last year. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT stunned the tech world and motivated countless companies to pivot their businesses to developing the industry. While Alphabet is no stranger to AI, the company has similarly ramped up its expansion in AI since the start of 2023.\nLast December, Alphabet unveiled Gemini, a highly anticipated AI model expected to be competitive with OpenAI's GPT-4. The new model could open the door to countless growth opportunities in AI for Alphabet and give it an edge against cloud rivals Microsoft and Amazon.\nWith Gemini, Alphabet could have the technology to create a search experience closer to ChatGPT, offer more effective advertising, introduce new AI tools on Google Cloud, and better track viewing trends on YouTube. Each of these has the potential to significantly boost earnings in the coming years.\nMoreover, Alphabet hit over $77 billion in free cash flow last year, considerably more than Microsoft or Amazon. The company's considerable cash reserves strengthen Alphabet's outlook in AI, as it has the funds to invest heavily in its research and development and overcome potential hurdles.\nAlphabet's digital-ad business accounts for more than 80% of its revenue. The company has thrived in the $740 billion industry, responsible for about 26% of the market.\nThe Google company's success in the digital space is mainly owed to the immense popularity of its services. Alphabet has nine products with over 1 billion users, with the top performers being Google Search, Android, and Chrome. These platforms have made Alphabet a household name and offer the company almost endless advertising opportunities.\nThe digital-ad market encountered some obstacles in 2022, as spikes in inflation caused many businesses to cut costs. However, the industry appears to be recovering. According to Insider Intelligence, digital-ad spending is projected to rise 13% in 2024.\nMeanwhile, Alphabet's recent quarterly reports reflect market improvements. In the third quarter of 2023, revenue rose 11% year over year, beating Wall Street estimates by nearly $1 billion. The growth was mainly thanks to an 11% rise in Google Search revenue and a 12% increase in YouTube ads.\nFurthermore, AI is expected to increase profit margins in Alphabet's ad segments this year with the help of more generative features and automated ads.\nDespite significant stock growth last year, Alphabet remains one of the cheapest options among the \"Magnificent Seven\" of tech. This phrase was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett last year to describe the seven best-performing tech companies, which include Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and, of course, Alphabet.\nThese companies' stocks are known for delivering significant long-term stock growth. As a result, if they're trading at the right price, it's worth adding a few to your portfolio. And Alphabet is an attractive option in 2024.\nThese charts compare the price-to-earnings ratios (P/E) and price-to-free cash flows of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" with Alphabet's figures the lowest on both fronts. The Google company's lower-valuation metrics indicate its stock is the cheapest option of these companies.\nP/E is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share. Meanwhile, price-to-free cash flow divides a company's market cap by its free cash flow. These metrics are helpful when determining a stock's value as they take into account a company's financial health.\nAs the cheapest option among some of the best-performing tech stocks, Alphabet is a screaming buy in 2024.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "Text": "Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) stock sank after the company reported its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, which missed analysts' expectations on ad revenue, the heart of the tech giant's business.\nThe stock slid more than 5% in early trading Wednesday, part of a broad decline for the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC).\nRevenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs for the third quarter, was $72 billion versus expectations of nearly $71 billion. That's higher than the $63.12 billion the company generated during the same period in the prior year. But investors seemed to focus on the advertising miss.\nThe company reported continued growth in its cloud business, which has grown in importance to investors because of its usefulness in the development of artificial intelligence. Google Cloud revenue beat expectations, crossing $9 billion and amounting to a 26% jump from a year ago.\u00a0The company has been pushing to claim additional market share in the cloud computing market, where it currently sits in third place behind competitors Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT).\nHere are some of Alphabet\u2019s most significant metrics compared to what Wall Street was expecting in the company\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter, according to data from Bloomberg:\nRevenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs: $72.32 billion vs. $70.97 billion expected ($63.12 billion in Q4 2022)\nAdjusted earnings per share: $1.64 vs. $1.59 expected ($1.05 in Q4 2022)\nCloud revenue: $9.19 billion vs. $8.95 billion expected ($7.32 billion in Q4 2022)\nAd revenue: $65.5 billion vs. $65.8 billion expected ($59.04 billion in Q4 2022)\nDuring a call with analysts, both CEO Sundar Pichai and CFO Ruth Porat noted the importance of streamlining the business to achieve cost savings and efficiency.\n\u201cAcross different teams, we have wound down some non-priority projects which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas,\u201d said Pichai.\nPorat said the company is focused on removing organizational layers to boost efficiency, which has resulted in a slower pace of hiring. She added that the company will continue to invest in top talent.\nThe earnings report arrives just weeks after Google laid off hundreds of workers across multiple divisions, as the company aims to cut expenses and focus on growth areas, including AI. The tech giant joined several of its peers and others across corporate America that have relied on layoffs to boost efficiency in the wake of significant expansions in the COVID era.\nGoogle's executives also responded to concerns that the advancement of AI may disrupt the company's search products since generative AI chatbots change the way people interact with the web.\nPichai said that AI tools expand Google's arsenal, which offers a breadth and depth of information to users who crave a diversity of sources online.\nGoogle has been widely seen as playing catch-up to Microsoft, which was among the first in the tech world to reap the cultural excitement around consumer AI chatbots. Microsoft invested in OpenAI, the company behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT.\nGoogle has embarked on a host of efforts to both augment its search tools with AI (Bard and Search Generative Experience) and to offer new, advanced large language models, like Gemini.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Revenue Growth: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported a 13% year-over-year increase in Q4 revenues, reaching $86.31 billion.\nOperating Income: Operating income for Q4 jumped to $23.7 billion, reflecting a higher operating margin of 27%.\nNet Income: Net income soared to $20.68 billion in Q4, with diluted EPS climbing to $1.64.\nWorkforce and Office Space Optimization: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) recorded charges related to workforce reduction and office space optimization, impacting financials.\nCapital Expenditure: The company's strategic investments in property and equipment are evident in the net property and equipment figure of $134.345 billion for FY 2023.\nOn January 30, 2024, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) released its 8-K filing, detailing the financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The company, which is the parent of internet media giant Google, reported a significant increase in revenue and net income, attributing much of its success to its investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and innovation.\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a diversified technology conglomerate with Google as its flagship subsidiary. Google's diverse revenue streams include online advertising, sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, cloud service fees, and hardware sales. Alphabet also invests in ambitious \"moonshot\" projects through its Other Bets segment, aiming to revolutionize technology in health, internet access, autonomous driving, and more.\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported a robust financial performance for Q4, with consolidated revenues of $86 billion, marking a 13% increase year over year. The growth was consistent in constant currency terms as well. Operating income rose to $23.7 billion, up from $18.16 billion in the same quarter the previous year, and net income increased to $20.68 billion, up from $13.62 billion. These results underscore the importance of Alphabet's AI investments, particularly in Search, YouTube, and Cloud services.\nDespite these achievements, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) faced challenges, including a workforce reduction and office space optimization, which led to significant charges. The company recorded $2.1 billion in employee severance and related charges and $1.8 billion in exit charges for office space optimization for the fiscal year 2023. These actions, while aimed at improving operational efficiency, resulted in considerable expenses that impacted the financial statements.\nThe company's financial achievements, particularly in the context of the Interactive Media industry, are significant. Alphabet's ability to consistently grow its revenue and maintain a high operating margin in a competitive and rapidly evolving sector demonstrates the effectiveness of its strategic focus on AI and innovation. The growth in Google Cloud revenues, which reached $9.19 billion in Q4, highlights the company's expanding presence in the cloud services market.\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s financial strength is further illustrated by its balance sheet, with total assets increasing from $365.26 billion in 2022 to $402.39 billion in 2023. The company's liquidity position is solid, with cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $110.92 billion. The increase in net property and equipment to $134.345 billion reflects Alphabet's continued investment in its operational infrastructure.\nImportant metrics such as the operating margin, which improved to 27%, and diluted EPS, which increased to $1.64, are critical indicators of Alphabet's profitability and efficiency. These metrics are vital for investors as they assess the company's ability to generate earnings and manage expenses effectively.\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s performance in Q4 and the fiscal year 2023 is a testament to the company's strategic vision and execution. The growth in key areas such as Search, YouTube, and Cloud, coupled with prudent cost management, has positioned the company for continued success. However, the charges related to workforce and office space optimization serve as a reminder of the ongoing need to adapt to market conditions and optimize operations.\nOverall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has demonstrated resilience and adaptability in a dynamic market, leveraging its AI capabilities to drive growth and efficiency. As the company enters what CEO Sundar Pichai refers to as the \"Gemini era,\" investors and industry observers will be keenly watching how Alphabet's investments in AI and other technologies continue to shape its financial trajectory.\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Alphabet Inc for further details.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Why Alphabet Stock Rallied 58% in 2023, and Why There's More in Store for 2024",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) charged sharply higher in 2023, soaring 58%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. The rally was in sharp contrast to its performance in 2022, when the stock plunged 39%.\nWhile the company no doubt benefited from the improving economy, it was Alphabet's latest foray into artificial intelligence (AI) that has investors most excited.\nThe bear market that began in 2022 took a toll on Alphabet stock, as the digital advertising that generates the lion's share of Google's revenue dried up, resulting in year-over-year revenue declines. Businesses tend to slash marketing budgets during economic challenges to shore up their financial positions. As the industry leader in online advertising, Alphabet felt the impact more than most.\nThe improving economy in 2023 saw marketers loosen their purse strings, and ad spending resumed, which gave the company a boost. However, it was the advent of AI last year that really kicked Alphabet stock into high gear.\nAI is nothing new, having been around for decades. Furthermore, Alphabet has long used these algorithms to improve the accuracy and relevance of its search, ensure its digital advertising finds its target audience, and underpin the autonomous systems for its Waymo self-driving cars.\nHowever, advances in the field of generative AI promise to be a game changer, and Alphabet was quick to throw its hat in the ring. This latest branch of AI can create original content, summarize and draft email responses, create presentations, search the internet and company records for data, and even write and debug computer code.\nMicrosoft and its partnership with ChatGPT parent OpenAI was arguably the catalyst for the AI revolution that ensued, but Alphabet was quick to respond to the challenge. While its Bard chatbot initially stumbled, Google quickly recovered, infusing AI across a broad cross-section of its vast empire. AI-powered tools improved Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Slides, among others, while the company also announced plans to augment its search with new AI-fueled capabilities.\nPerhaps the most important development, however, was the debut of generative AI tools on Google Cloud. Just last month, the company announced the debut of Gemini AI, which the company called its \"largest and most capable AI model.\" Google says its latest entry is far more advanced than GPT-4, which forms the foundation of ChatGPT, with five times the computational power.\nGemini was tested on various skills, including audio and video understanding, natural image, and mathematical reasoning, \"exceeding current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely used academic benchmarks used in large language model (LLM) research and development.\" Gemini also scored 90% using massive multitask language understanding (MMLU), one of the predominant approaches for testing AI's problem-solving proficiency. This resulted in Gemini being the first generative AI \"model to outperform human experts\" using this standard.\nGiven the steady improvements in the economy and the company's foray into generative AI, 2024 is stacking up to be a good year for Alphabet. We don't know how big AI could be, but current estimates suggest a range of between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to data compiled by the McKinsey Global Institute.\nThat, combined with Alphabet's dominant position in search and digital advertising, suggests the company is well positioned coming into 2024. Make no mistake: Alphabet stock is a buy.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "When internet giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) went public in 2004, it didn't have the monopoly on internet searches it has today. Granted, it still had between 35% and 44% market share, but few knew it would become the juggernaut it is today. More than 90% of searches now use Google, the world's most visited website.\nEach dollar invested in Alphabet's IPO would be worth $55 today. That 55x return over two decades crushes the broader stock market's comparable performance.\nWhile some things like Google search remain intact, Alphabet is a different company than it was back then. And it's likely to be a different type of investment moving forward.\nBuying into Alphabet early on would have easily carried an investment portfolio to success. Does Alphabet still have the juice to carry a portfolio? Here is what you need to know.\nThe search engine alone didn't make Alphabet such an excellent investment. Its success stems from arguably the most brilliant acquisition in corporate history. Alphabet spent $1.65 billion in stock to acquire video platform YouTube in late 2006. The company was less than two years old then, but Alphabet saw something special, and it was right.\nToday YouTube is the world's second-most visited website. The company generated nearly $8 billion in YouTube ad revenue in its most recently reported quarter. Based on that total, Alphabet effectively recoups its initial investment in YouTube every three weeks.\nThe combination of Google and YouTube turned Alphabet into a cash-printing machine that sells ads to companies that want to reach the largest internet audiences. Raking in nearly $78 billion in free cash flow over the past year, Alphabet is a deep-pocketed tech giant that can throw money at new opportunities, fend off (or acquire) potential threats, or cannibalize its shares (through repurchasing) to boost earnings growth.\nEvery company goes through phases where growth speeds up and slows down, but generally growth becomes harder as numbers get big. At nearly $300 billion in annual revenue, you can see that phenomenon in effect for Alphabet now (see chart below). Alphabet isn't the hyper-growth stock it was years ago. Therefore, investment returns won't look the same as in the past.\nBut that doesn't mean that Alphabet cannot still anchor a long-term portfolio.\nThe company still invests its profits in growth. It's built a cloud platform and launched software for mobile devices (Android), office software (Google Workspace), and generative AI (Gemini) to rival ChatGPT.\nBut it makes so much money that it has a lot left over. Alphabet currently has a whopping $120 billion in cash on its balance sheet against just $12 billion in debt. The stock doesn't pay a dividend, but management has instead begun repurchasing its stock. The number of outstanding shares has dropped 10% over the past five years, and shareholders should expect that to continue. Alphabet has spent $60 billion on repurchases over the past year alone.\nAlphabet is a well-followed stock on Wall Street and a member of the \"Magnificent Seven,\" a handful of mega-cap technology stocks that soared in 2023. The stock price jumped 55% over the past 12 months.\nThe company's growth outlook looks promising, thanks largely to Alphabet's aggressive share repurchases. Analysts believe the company can compound earnings at over 17% annually over the long term.\nTrading at nearly 27 times earnings today, the stock isn't as cheap as before 2023's run. However, Alphabet could justify its higher valuation if it delivers growth that matches analysts' expectations. The current PEG ratio of 1.5 is reasonable for one of the world's strongest companies.\nThat doesn't mean shares won't be volatile along the way. If you do want to buy Alphabet, consider a dollar-cost average strategy. You buy the stock a little at a time to take advantage of the market's ups and downs, but leave some dry powder if shares fall to a more attractive valuation in the future.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

The figure is expected to reach $37.84 billion by 2028, registering a CAGR of 9.1% between 2024 and 2028.\nGoogle\u2019s latest investment plans are in sync with its growing efforts to strengthen its footprint in Europe.Apart from the U.K. data center, the opening of its second cloud region in Italy last year, which is located in Turin, remains a major positive.At present, Google operates 11 cloud regions in Europe, each with three zones.Apart from Europe, Google\u2019s growing interest in the APAC region remains noteworthy.The company is gaining well from its cloud regions located in Tel Aviv, Israel; New Delhi, India and Melbourne, Australia.Looking across the world, the total number of Google Cloud regions is currently 39, with 118 zones and 187 network edge locations.Google Cloud\u2019s newly added regions include Berlin, Germany; Doha, Qatar and Dammam, Saudi Arabia.Google Cloud intends to further expand its cloud region network in Doha (Qatar), Berlin (Germany), Dammam (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) and Queretaro (Mexico).Also, it is preparing to open cloud regions in Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand, New Zealand, Greece, Norway, South Africa, Austria and Sweden.We believe all these endeavors are expected to contribute well to the performance of Google Cloud in the near term as well as in the long haul.\nWith the increasing number of regions across the globe, Google remains well-poised to capitalize on the prospects of the global cloud market.Per a Grand View Research report, the global cloud computing market is assumed to witness a CAGR of 14.1% from 2023 to 2030.Google\u2019s growing prospects in the booming cloud computing market are expected to aid Alphabet in winning investors\u2019 confidence in the days ahead.This apart, Google\u2019s concerted efforts are expected to aid its competitive position against other major cloud players, such as Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT, which are also leaving no stone unturned to boost their presence in this promising market further.Amazon is constantly benefiting from the solid momentum in its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), which holds a dominant position in the cloud computing space on the back of its increasing number of data centers, availability zones and regions.The company\u2019s recent launch of its second infrastructure region in Canada, which is in Calgary, remains noteworthy. AWS\u2019 increasing regions in Europe remain a plus. The company operates seven AWS Regions and 21 availability zones across Europe in Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Milan, Paris, Stockholm and Zurich.Currently, AWS has 105 Availability Zones across 33 geographic regions. It further plans to launch 12 more Availability Zones and four more AWS regions in Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.Meanwhile, Microsoft Azure became Microsoft's key driver. MSFT is currently riding on the robust adoption of Azure\u2019s cloud offerings. Azure's increasing number of availability zones and regions across the globe and its strength in the consumption-based business are likely to continue driving MSFT's cloud momentum in the near term.Microsoft\u2019s Azure is operating in more than 60 cloud regions at present.\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Arista Networks ANET, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present.

        "Title": "Does Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nAs you can see below, Alphabet had US$12.9b of debt, at September 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, it does have US$119.9b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$107.1b.\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Alphabet had liabilities of US$86.3b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$37.2b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of US$119.9b and US$41.0b worth of receivables due within a year. So it actually has US$37.4b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nThis short term liquidity is a sign that Alphabet could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Succinctly put, Alphabet boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\nFortunately, Alphabet grew its EBIT by 3.7% in the last year, making that debt load look even more manageable. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Alphabet can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. While Alphabet has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Alphabet recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 89% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Alphabet has US$107.1b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$78b, being 89% of its EBIT. So we don't think Alphabet's use of debt is risky. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Alphabet, you may well want to click here to check an interactive graph of its earnings per share history.\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The market expects Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 30, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +52.4%.\nRevenues are expected to be $70.71 billion, up 12% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Alphabet Inc.\nFor Alphabet Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.26%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination indicates that Alphabet Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Alphabet Inc. Would post earnings of $1.45 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.55, delivering a surprise of +6.90%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nAlphabet Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Is It Too Late to Buy Alphabet Stock?",
        "Author": "  Will Healy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "For the first time in years, investors are struggling with what to make of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The stock has continued to move higher, but the Google parent's search engine has had more competition with the rise of ChatGPT. That stoked doubts about whether the \"AI-first\" company could be first in AI.\nNonetheless, investors should not fear it is too late to profit from this company. Here's why.\nThe doubts about Alphabet's AI prowess are not without justification. Due to Microsoft's close relationship with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, consumers have more reason to turn to the Bing search engine instead of Google. Moreover, when it comes to AI, investors have tended to focus on companies such as Palantir, UiPath, or Nvidia rather than Alphabet.\nHowever, to answer this competitive challenge, Google DeepMind has released Gemini, its most advanced generative AI model. The company claims Gemini can exceed state-of-the-art results in 30 of 32 academic benchmarks for large language models. Such results could convince investors that Alphabet will not be so easily surpassed in the AI field.\nInvestors also have reasons for optimism that are less related to AI. Advertising revenue, which accounted for 78% of Alphabet's top line in 2023's third quarter, grew 9% year over year, suggesting that the long-awaited recovery in this market has begun.\nMoreover, Google Cloud, the company's largest segment not directly tied to advertising, grew its revenue by 22% year over year in Q3. It is the third-largest cloud infrastructure provider, with an 11% market share as of Q2 2023.\nFurthermore, Alphabet owns numerous businesses besides Google Cloud that are not broken out separately in the company's financials. Verily Life Sciences and self-driving car company Waymo offer potential new avenues for revenue. They can also complement the company's AI-related developments, creating a more urgent need to maintain a technical edge.\nBest of all, if Alphabet falls behind in any particular area, it holds the resources to catch up quickly. It held around $120 billion in liquidity at the end of Q3, and generated almost $23 billion in free cash flow in the period.\nThat may explain why the stock rose by about 54% over the past year, even if some investors doubted Alphabet's position in AI. Despite that increase, Alphabet has the lowest P/E ratio among the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies, trading at just 26 times earnings. Such a valuation could induce some investors to add shares.\nConsidering Alphabet's market position, cash reserves, and valuation, it is certainly not too late to buy shares. Admittedly, ChatGPT's release caught investors off guard. Nonetheless, the release of Gemini shows that Alphabet still wants to be viewed as an AI-first company and will devote the resources necessary to maintain that claim.\nOther businesses, like its crucial ad business and the emerging Google Cloud, have also shown signs of recovery. Considering its high level of liquidity and low valuation, Alphabet's stock should remain an excellent choice for investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Alphabet's estimated fair value is US$145 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nAlphabet's US$143 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate\nOur fair value estimate is 7.2% lower than Alphabet's analyst price target of US$157\nHow far off is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n Check out our latest analysis for Alphabet \nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$87.7b\nUS$99.6b\nUS$119.2b\nUS$123.5b\nUS$117.3b\nUS$114.2b\nUS$112.8b\nUS$112.6b\nUS$113.2b\nUS$114.4b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x17\nAnalyst x15\nAnalyst x5\nAnalyst x2\nAnalyst x1\nEst @ -2.67%\nEst @ -1.20%\nEst @ -0.17%\nEst @ 0.54%\nEst @ 1.05%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.5% \nUS$81.6k\nUS$86.2k\nUS$95.8k\nUS$92.4k\nUS$81.5k\nUS$73.8k\nUS$67.8k\nUS$62.9k\nUS$58.8k\nUS$55.3k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$756b\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.5%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$114b\u00d7 (1 + 2.2%) \u00f7 (7.5%\u2013 2.2%) = US$2.2t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$2.2t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.5%)10= US$1.1t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$1.8t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$143, the company appears about fair value at a 1.8% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alphabet as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.065. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nEarnings declined over the past year.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Alphabet, there are three essential items you should assess:\nFinancial Health: Does GOOGL have a healthy balance sheet?

        "Title": "Is Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock's Recent Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Most readers would already know that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock increased by 4.4% over the past month. Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Alphabet's  ROE today.\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n Check out our latest analysis for Alphabet \nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:\n24% = US$67b \u00f7 US$273b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.24 in profit.\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nTo begin with, Alphabet has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 11% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Alphabet's exceptional 20% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.\nWe then compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 6.2% in the same 5-year period.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for GOOGL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. \nGiven that Alphabet doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, we infer that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits to grow its business.\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Alphabet's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down. To know more about the company's future earnings growth forecasts take a look at this free report on analyst forecasts for the company to find out more.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.\u2019s lab for pioneering technology is laying off dozens of employees as it turns to outside investors to help fund its ventures.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTesla Sinks After Warning About \u2018Notably Lower\u2019 Growth Rate\nUS GDP Grew 3.3% Last Quarter, Capping Unexpectedly Strong Year\nPutin Sends US Signal on Ukraine Talks, Sensing Advantage in War\nMicrosoft Cuts 1,900 Jobs in Gaming, Including at Activision\nThe division, known as X, has in recent months ramped up discussions on funding with venture capitalists and other investors, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named as it is private. The lab is adopting a new structure that\u2019ll enable its projects to more easily spin out of X as independent startups with support from Alphabet and outside backers, according to one of the people and an email to staff obtained by Bloomberg.\nX seeks bold approaches to major challenges like climate change and connectivity, but its efforts have yielded few durable businesses thus far.\n\u201cWe\u2019re expanding our approach to focus on spinning out more projects as independent companies funded through market-based capital,\u201d Astro Teller, who leads to lab, wrote in the email. \u201cWe\u2019ll do this by opening our scope to collaborate with a broader base of industry and financial partners, and by continuing to emphasize lean teams and capital efficiency.\u201d\nAs part of the restructuring, X is laying off dozens of employees, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter. The layoffs are focused on support staff, the person said. Alphabet didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment.\nLaunched by Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, X has captured the public imagination by pursuing projects from self-driving cars to high-altitude balloons that connect remote communities to the internet. But in recent years the lab has come under more pressure to show that it can turn its speculative bets into profitable businesses, and Alphabet as a whole is waging a campaign to cut costs.\nRead more: Job Cuts at Google Are Now \u2018Business as Usual\u2019: Tech Daily\nThis month, Google eliminated hundreds of jobs on teams including hardware and engineering, with more cuts potentially on the way as it sharpens its focus on artificial intelligence. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, who has sought to instill greater financial discipline, is moving into a new role as president and chief investment officer, in which she will oversee a division that includes X.\n\u201cShe will put more heat into the kitchen and help drive success and viable businesses,\u201d Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in an email.\nSince Google reorganized itself as a conglomerate in 2015, X\u2019s moonshots have sought to \u201cgraduate\u201d as Other Bets, or independent ventures under the banner of parent company Alphabet. But Alphabet could only accommodate so many Other Bets, creating a bottleneck for X ventures that were ready to take the next step, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter. Startups within X often faced a choice between waiting for a spot to open up or striking out on their own.\nX employees had explored raising outside capital for their ventures in the past, but they ran into concerns from Alphabet leadership, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.\nIn addition to seeking venture capital, X has met with family offices, sovereign wealth funds, private equity firms and strategic investors, or companies operating in the same industries that the moonshots are targeting, according to the people.\nSilicon Valley\u2019s innovation labs have come under threat in a time of layoffs and budget cuts. Last year, Google slashed most jobs at Area 120, an in-house startup incubator. X cut some jobs last year but has refrained from making more significant changes until now.\n\u201cThis approach will give us more opportunity to focus on what Xers do best: inventing breakthrough technologies to help solve some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges,\u201d Teller wrote in the note to staff. \u201cBecause the world needs moonshots more now than ever.\u201d\n--With assistance from Sarah McBride, Mark Bergen and Sankalp Phartiyal.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow the West\u2019s Favorite Autocrat Engineered Africa\u2019s Most Dramatic Turnaround\nAI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around\nGoldman, Lazard Look to Ex-Spies to Gain an Edge in Volatile World\nStuck in a Downturn, Startups Ghost Investors\nWhy Did Car Insurance Get So Expensive?\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Reported EPS is $1.64, expectations were $1.6.\nOperator: Welcome, everyone. Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJim Friedland: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now, I'll quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors discussed in our upcoming Form 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2023. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\nSundar Pichai: Hello, everyone. Our results reflect strong momentum and product innovation continuing into 2024. Today, I'm going to talk about four main topics. One, our investments in AI, including how it's helping search. Two, subscriptions which reached $15 billion in annual revenue, up 5x since 2019. Subscriptions is growing strongly, powered by YouTube Premium and Music, YouTube TV and Google One. Three, Cloud which crossed $9 billion in revenues this quarter and saw accelerated growth driven by our Gen AI and product leadership. And four, our investments and focus to meet the growth opportunities ahead. First, AI and Search. As you know, we have long led the way in using AI to improve many of our products from search to ads, to most of our consumer and enterprise products, helping billions of people already.\nLast year brought new excitement around Gen AI and I'm proud of how we responded, responsibly with deep advances in foundation models and a number of great launches. We closed the year by launching the Gemini era, a new industry-leading series of models that will fuel the next generation of advances. Gemini is the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind, bringing together our two world-class research teams. It's engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video and code in a natively multimodal way and it can run on everything from mobile devices to data centers. Gemini gives us a great foundation. It's already demonstrating state-of-the-art capabilities and it's only going to get better. Gemini Ultra is coming soon.\nThe team is already working on the next versions and bringing it to our products. That starts with Search. We're already experimenting with Gemini in search where it's making our Search Generative Experience or SGE faster for users. We have seen a 40% reduction in latency in English in the U.S. I'm happy with what we are seeing in the earliest days of SGE, it's available through search labs in seven languages. By applying generative AI to Search, we are able to serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. People are finding it particularly useful for more complex questions like comparisons or longer queries. It's also helpful in areas where people are looking for deeper understanding such as education or even gift ideas.\nWe are improving satisfaction including answers for more conversational and intricate queries. As I mentioned earlier, we are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page and will continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users and send valuable traffic to publishers. Beyond SGE, we are continuing to use AI to make searching more accessible and intuitive. Circle to Search, lets you search what you see on Android phones with a simple gesture without switching apps. It's available starting this week on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro and the new Samsung Galaxy S24 Series. And Lens now offers generative AI overviews. You can add text to a visual search to ask questions about anything you see and get AI-powered insights in the moment.\nIn addition to Search, we are also seeing a lot of interest in our AI-powered solutions for advertisers. That includes our new conversational experience that uses Gemini to accelerate the creation of search campaigns. Then there is Bard, our conversational AI tool that complements search. It's now powered by Gemini Pro and is much more capable at things like understanding, summarizing, reasoning, coding and planning. It's now in over 40 languages and over 230 countries around the world. Looking ahead, we'll be rolling out an even more advanced version for subscribers powered by Gemini Ultra. That's a good segue to subscriptions. As I said earlier, it's now a $15 billion business annually. YouTube is the key driver of our subscription revenues.\nAvailable in over 100 countries and regions, YouTube Music and Premium have real momentum. They're engaging passionate users and driving great returns for the music industry and creators. YouTube TV is also doing well. We've had great consumer feedback on the viewing experience. People love the navigation, multi view and unlimited DVR. NFL Sunday Ticket has found it\u2019s perfect home on YouTube and Philipp will talk about that more. Let me also talk about our subscription service, Google One. It's doing incredibly well with strong user growth. It provides expanded storage, unlocks exclusive features in Google products and allows us to build a strong relationship with our most engaged users. Google One is growing very well and we are just about to cross 100 million subscribers.\nFrom here, we are going to bring in more AI features and look forward to more strong growth to come. Next, Google Cloud. Throughout 2023, we introduced thousands of product advances, including broad Gen AI capabilities across our AI infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform and our new Duvet AI agents. In Q4, our product and Gen AI leadership enabled us to win and expand relationships with many leading brands including Hugging Face, McDonald's, Motorola Mobility and Verizon. Google Cloud offers our AI Hypercomputer, a groundbreaking supercomputing architecture that combines our powerful TPUs and GPUs, AI software and multi-slice and multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models. Customers like Anthropic, Character AI, Essential AI and Mistral AI are building and serving models on it.\nFor developers building Gen AI applications, we offer Vertex AI, a comprehensive enterprise AI platform. It helps customers like Deutsche Telekom and Moody's discover, customize, augment and deploy over 130 Gen AI models, including PaLM, Med-PaLM, Sec-PaLM and Gemini, as well as popular open source and partner models. Vertex AI has seen strong adoption with the API request increasing nearly 6x from H1 to H2 last year. Using Vertex AI, Samsung recently announced its Galaxy S24 Series smartphone with Gemini and Imagen 2, our advanced text-to-image model. Shutterstock has added Imagen 2 to their AI image generator, enabling users to turn simple text prompts into unique visuals and Victoria's Secret & Company will look to personalize and improve the customer experience with Gemini, Vertex AI search and conversations.\nCustomers are increasingly choosing Duvet AI, our packaged AI agents for Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform to boost productivity and improve their operations. Since its launch, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duvet AI. It will incorporate Gemini soon. In Workspace, Duvet AI is helping employees benefit from improved productivity and creativity at thousands of paying customers around the world, including Singapore Post, Uber and Woolworths. In Google Cloud Platform, Duvet AI assist software developers and cybersecurity analysis. Duvet AI for developers is the only Gen AI offering to support the company development and operations lifecycle, fine-tune with the customers\u2019 own core corpus and policies.\nIt's helping Wayfair, GE Appliances and Commerzbank write better software, faster with AI code completion, code generation and chat support. With Duvet AI and security operations, we are helping cybersecurity teams at Fiserv, Spotify and Pfizer. Our robust growth has been driven by strong direct and indirect channels. With ISVs, we have nearly tripled the number of co-sell deals from 2022 to 2023. In our ecosystem, there are nearly 90,000 Google Cloud Gen AI-enabled consultants. And Accenture has teamed up with Google Cloud to create a joint generative AI center of excellence. Next, let me turn to our focus and discipline as we pursue the opportunities ahead. Search, YouTube and Cloud are supported by our state-of-the-art compute infrastructure.\nThis infrastructure is also key to realizing our big AI ambitions. It's a major differentiator for us. We continue to invest responsibly in our data centers and compute to support this new wave of growth in AI-powered services for us and for our customers. Through this, we are being disciplined in how we run the company. You've heard me talk about our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base and to improve our velocity and efficiency. That work continues. Teams are working to focus on key priorities and execute fast, removing layers and simplifying their organizational structures. As just one example, our devices team has brought together different teams from across Nest, Fitbit and other teams into a new functional structure. This will help us pull resources and drive progress across our Pixel portfolio.\nAcross different teams, we have wound down some non-priority projects, which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas. We are also improving our machine utilization, building on our years of experience in driving cost efficiencies in our computing infrastructure and operations. And through our supplier efficiency efforts and automation of certain processes, we have made major improvements in areas like procurement, achieving significant savings. That's a snapshot of the quarter. Before I close, a couple of other highlights. Pixel 8, our AI-first phone, was awarded Phone of the Year by numerous outlets. It now uses Gemini Nano with features like Magic Compose for Google Messages and more to come. In our Other Bets portfolio of companies, Waymo, which is deeply focused on safety, reached over 1 million fully autonomous ride-hailing trips.\nAnd Isomorphic Labs entered into strategic partnerships with Eli Lilly and Novartis to apply AI to treat diseases, which has great potential. 2023 was a year of profound innovation and product momentum. Thank you to our many partners. We succeed when our partners do, and we are grateful for the work we do together, from our partners across the Android ecosystem who are on display at CES to our deep relationships with retailers, small businesses and advertising partners, to the next generation of AI start-ups and developers and many more. I also want to thank all of our employees for their hard work throughout 2023 and the start of the new year. I'm excited for what's ahead in 2024. Philipp?\nPhilipp Schindler: Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. Google Services revenues of $76 billion were up 12% year-on-year. In Google advertising, Search and other revenues grew 13% year-on-year, led again by solid growth in the retail vertical. We had particular strength in retail in APAC, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the end of the year. YouTube ads revenue were up 16% year-on-year, driven by growth in both direct response and brand. And network revenues declined 2% year-on-year. In Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices, which was previously named Google Other, year-on-year revenues increased 23% driven by strong growth in subscriptions. Now for some color on the quarter and where we see continued upside for long-term advertising growth.\nOver the last few calls, I have consistently highlighted how we're putting Google AI to work for our customers to deliver profitability and help them achieve their goals in a do-more-with-less environment. From a product perspective, in Q4, Performance Max remained a bright spot. We're also excited about [demand gen] momentum. This is our big bet to help social advertisers find and convert consumers via immersive, relevant visual creatives across YouTube, including YouTube Shorts, Gmail and Discover. In a single campaign, you get access to over three billion users as they stream, scroll, connect and decide what to buy. Tens of thousands of advertisers are testing and on average seeing 6% more conversions per dollar versus image-only ads and discovery campaigns.\nAs we look ahead, we're also starting to put generative AI in the hands of more and more businesses to help them build better campaigns and even better performing ads. Automatically created assets help advertisers show more relevant search ads by creating tailored headlines and descriptions based on each ads\u2019 context. Adoption was up with strong feedback in Q4. In addition to now being available in eight languages, more advanced Gen AI-powered capabilities are coming to ACA. And then last week's big news was that Gemini will power a new conversational experience in Google Ads. This is open in beta to U.S. and UK advertisers. Early tests show advertisers are building higher-quality search campaigns with less effort, especially SMBs who are 42% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength.\nWe can't wait to see how this continues to drive performance and level the playing field for advertisers of all sizes. As we shared last quarter, ads will continue to play an important role in the new search experience, and we'll continue to experiment with new formats native to SGE. SGE is creating new opportunities for us to improve commercial journeys for people by showing relevant ads alongside search results. We've also found that people are finding ads either above or below the AI-powered overview helpful as they provide useful options for people to take action and connect with businesses. Looking at our strong Search performance for the fourth quarter. Retail was a highlight. We continue to see a stronger start to the season up to and including Cyber Five.\nIn Q3, we indicated that we were seeing early trends of consumers being very price-conscious, and we saw this play out in Q4. With promotional demand at an all-time high, deal seekers using Google had access to 2x the deals in the U.S. versus last season as well as a better shopping experience. Launches included a one-stop shop deals destination, new filters like GetItFast and AI-generated gifting recommendations in SGE. These new features drove incremental query growth during key shopping moments like Cyber Five. Our proven AI-powered ad solutions were also a win for retailers looking to accelerate omni growth and capture holiday demand. Quick examples include a large U.S. big-box retailer who drove a 60%-plus increase in omni ROAS and a 22%-plus increase in store traffic using Performance Max during Cyber-Five; and a well-known global fashion brand, who drove a 15%-plus higher omnichannel conversion rate versus regular shopping traffic by showcasing its store pickup offering across top markets through pickup later on shopping ads.\nMoving on to YouTube. We're obviously pleased with YouTube's advertising revenue growth in Q4 and also significant growth in our subscription revenue. I'll reiterate what I have said before. YouTube success starts with creator success. We give millions of creators more ways to create content and connect with fans and more ways to make money and build their own businesses than any other platform. More creators means more content, which leads to more viewers. And via ads and subscriptions, these viewers fund our creators and drive the eyeballs and engagement our advertisers want. To keep this momentum going, we're focused on delivering value across four pillars: creation, viewers, monetization and responsibility. First, creation, which increasingly takes place on mobile devices.\nWe've invested in a full suite of tools, including our new YouTube Create app for Shorts, to help people make everything from 15-second Shorts to 15-minute videos to 15-hour live streams with a production studio in the palm of their hands. Gen AI is supercharging these capabilities. Anyone with a phone can swap in a new backdrop, remove background extras, translate their video into dozens of languages, all without a big studio budget. We're excited about our first products in this area from Dream Screen for AI-generated backgrounds to allowed for AI-powered dubbing. There is more to come. Number two, viewers. We continue to grow watch time across YouTube with strong growth in Shorts and Connected TV. Shorts remains a top priority. We have 2 billion-plus logged-in users every month, and we are averaging 70 billion in daily views.\nConnected TVs or what we refer to as the living room is where viewership is growing the fastest. We're investing to make this experience even better with interactive features tailored to TVs, plus the content people love: our creators, NFL Sunday Ticket and the range of live sports and studio content via YouTube TV and Primetime Channels. Put this all together, and YouTube is the must-have app on every Connected TV. Monetization is pillar number three and realized through a combination of ad-supported and subscription offerings. Advertising generates the bulk of our revenue, and we continue to invest heavily here. We've rolled out CTV-first formats like 30-second non-skippable ads and pause experiences as well as an industry-first send-to-phone experience that lets people use a second screen to engage with ads.\nFor Shorts, we've developed new formats that are less interruptive to viewers. It's early. We're learning but excited by the opportunities for ads this can unlock. Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely. Our AI part video format from video reach and video view campaigns to demand gen and video action continue to make advertiser dollars go further and drive results across the funnel. We're also introducing new and existing advertisers to YouTube via sports content. 90-plus upfront and scatter advertisers, including Unilever, are partnering with YouTube in our first year across NFL Sunday Ticket in-game advertising opportunities. Our subscription offerings are also growing at a healthy clip. YouTube Music and Premium performed well.\nPremium users are delivering more value to our partners and YouTube than even ad-supported users do. On average, each additional Premium sign-up boost earnings for creators, music and media partners and YouTube itself. And we've made Premium even more attractive with new features, bundles and other enhancements. We're also pleased with our first season of NFL Sunday Ticket. It gave creators new opportunities to create content and feed user engagement across traditional user content and professional sports content. Feedback on the user experience, including MultiView, has been great. We're excited to continue to innovate here. Responsibility is our fourth pillar, and it underlines everything we do across YouTube. We continue to focus relentlessly on this.\nAs always, deepening our relationships with key partners to bring them the best of Google is a key priority for us, and we continue to do this across industries in Q4. We just talked about the NFL. Sundar mentioned Samsung, among others earlier. Another highlight was our expanded partnership with Porsche to enhance customers' digital experiences with a deeper in-vehicle integration of Google built-in services, including Google Maps and Play. Whether it's continued collaboration with our partners and key ecosystems, we're putting Google AI to work for more customers. I'm excited about the opportunities for continued impact in 2024. I'll wrap with a huge note of gratitude to our customers and partners. Our success is only possible because of their success and then to our Googlers for their outstanding work and focus this year.\nRuth, over to you.\nRuth Porat: Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our full year results with 2023 Alphabet revenues of $307 billion, up 9% versus 2022, which added $25 billion to revenues for the year. We ended with a strong fourth quarter with consolidated revenues of $86.3 billion, up 13% versus last year in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. Total cost of revenues was $37.6 billion, up 6%. Other cost of revenues was $23.6 billion, up 5%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube subscription offerings. The growth rate also reflects the offsetting benefit of lapping $1.2 billion in inventory-related charges that we called out in the fourth quarter last year as well as a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of 2023.\nIn terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect an additional $1.2 billion in exit charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated headcount. Operating expenses were $25 billion, up 11%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D expenses, which were driven by the real estate charges, followed by compensation. Operating income was $23.7 billion, up 30%, and our operating margin was 27%. Net income was $20.7 billion, and EPS was $1.64. We delivered free cash flow of $7.9 billion, which was affected by the timing of the $10.5 billion tax payment we made on October 16 that we called out previously related to the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter.\nFor the full-year 2023, free cash flow was $69 billion. We repurchased a total of $62 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2023 and ended the year with $111 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $76.3 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48 billion in the quarter were up 13%, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $9.2 billion were up 16% driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $8.3 billion were down 2%. Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices revenues, which we previously referred to as other revenues, were $10.8 billion, up 23%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues.\nTAC was $14 billion, up 8%. Google Services operating income was $26.7 billion, up 32%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $9.2 billion for the quarter, up 26%. We're very pleased with the momentum of GCP with an increasing contribution from AI. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $864 million and an operating margin of 9%. As to our Other Bets, for the full-year 2023, revenues were $1.5 billion, and the operating loss was $4.1 billion. Results in the fourth quarter benefited from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising.\nWe were pleased with the sequential revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising throughout 2023, which reflects the extraordinary work across our teams to drive improved experiences for users and attractive ROI for advertisers. As we enter 2024 with advertising revenues of more than $100 billion higher than 2019, we remain focused on sustaining healthy growth on this larger base. Second, within Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices, our total revenues from subscription products reached $15 billion for the full-year 2023, driven primarily by substantial growth in subscribers for our YouTube subscription offerings. The substantial increase in our subscription revenues over the past few years demonstrates the ability of our teams to deliver high value-add offerings and provides a strong base on which to build, including through YouTube and newer services like Google One.\nPlay had solid growth again in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. In Devices, we continue to make sizable investments with increased emphasis on our Pixel family, particularly with AI-powered innovation while driving further efficiencies across the portfolio. Turning to Google Cloud. We are pleased with operating performance in the year. Full year revenues of $33 billion were up 26% versus prior year, ending with strong Q4 performance. The Cloud team is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini, our industry-leading AI technology, to enterprises and governments globally, and we are gratified with the level of engagement. The strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area.\nIn terms of profitability, the improvement in 2023 reflects sustained focus across the team with the intent to maintain healthy profitability while we continue to invest to support long-term growth. Turning to margins and expenses. As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain committed to our framework to durably reengineer our cost base as we invest to support our growth priorities. Key contributors to moderating our expense growth include: first, product and process prioritization to ensure we have the right resources behind our most important opportunities and to reallocate resources where we can; second, organizational efficiency and structure. We're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity. Both product prioritization and the organization design efforts result in a slower pace of hiring, as you can see with our headcount down year-on-year, reflecting the reductions we announced in the first quarter of 2023 and a much slower pace of hiring.\nWe will continue to invest in top technical and engineering talent. Finally, we continue to execute the other work streams to slow expense growth, including improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI, increasing efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization, and optimizing our real estate portfolio. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the fourth quarter was $11 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. The step-up in CapEx in Q4 reflects our outlook for the extraordinary applications of AI to deliver for users, advertisers, developers, cloud enterprise customers and governments globally and the long-term growth opportunities that offers.\nIn 2024, we expect investment in CapEx will be notably larger than in 2023. With regard to Other Bets, we've been working to sharpen our investment focus while capturing the upside given compelling technology breakthroughs across the portfolio. For example, last week, Alphabet's X announced that it would be moving to spin out more projects as independent companies through external capital, giving X the opportunity to bring more focus to the breakthrough technologies it is working on to address some of the world's most pressing challenges.

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) were falling today after the tech giant reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results. Alphabet beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines in its fourth quarter, but its ad revenue was a bit short of expectations. The sell-off also came after the stock jumped more than 50% in 2023, a sign that investors may believe it had become overheated.\nAs of 1:11 p.m. ET, shares were down 6.6%.\nAlphabet reported 13% revenue growth to $86.3 billion, which beat expectations of $85.3 billion. Operating income jumped 30% to $23.7 billion as its operating margin expanded from 24% to 27%.\nOn the bottom line, earnings per share jumped from $1.05 to $1.64, aided by accounting gains on its equity securities. That result topped the consensus for $1.59.\nHowever, investors seemed to zero in on the ad business, the source of the majority of its profits, where revenue grew just 11% to $65.5 billion due to a decline in its Google Network segment, which shows ads on other websites. Analysts had expected ad revenue to come in at $66.1 billion.\nElsewhere, Google Cloud continued to show strength with revenue up 26% to $9.2 billion, and it reported operating income of $864 million, up by more than $1 billion from the quarter a year ago.\nOn the call, management talked up its recent artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives like Gemini, but offered little in the way of details on new products or businesses.\nIt's hard to fault a company the size of Alphabet for only growing ad revenue by 11%, but the results will be more telling after investors see the performance of peers like Meta Platforms, which has been taking ad market share from Alphabet in recent quarters. Losing market share is generally a negative sign for any company, though Alphabet seems to be benefiting from the broader ad market recovery from the lull in 2022.\nAt this point, there's little reason to sell the stock on yesterday's report as its search and YouTube businesses still look solid, and its valuation looks substantially improved. However, investors should keep an eye on the ad business in future quarters to see if the current trend persists.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "Will Oracle Be Worth More Than Alphabet by 2030?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Many investors might dismiss Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) as a slow-growth tech stock which is owned for stability and income instead of big, long-term gains. But over the past five years, Oracle's stock actually rallied 130% and generated a total return of 150% after including its reinvested dividends. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), which doesn't pay any dividends, posted a gain of 176% during the same period.\nOracle impressed investors with the expansion of its cloud ecosystem and big buybacks. However, its market cap of $316 billion still makes it a lot smaller than Alphabet, which is now worth $1.91 trillion. So could Oracle follow Alphabet into the 12-zero club and eclipse its market cap by the end of the decade?\nOracle is the world's largest database-software company. Over the past decade, it gradually transformed its on-premise database software into cloud-based services, which were easier to scale and locked in its clients with sticky subscriptions.\nThat transformation was driven by a long list of acquisitions, including the cloud-software giant NetSuite in 2016 and the healthcare IT services leader Cerner in 2022. It expanded that cloud-based ecosystem with its new enterprise-resource planning (ERP) services and its own Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) platform.\nFrom fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last May), Oracle's revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%. That growth rate might seem sluggish, but it represented a significant acceleration from its CAGR of 1% from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2018. That acceleration was driven by the growth of its software as a service (SaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) businesses, which collectively generated 37% of its revenue in its latest quarter.\nAs Oracle's revenue growth accelerated, it repatriated a lot of its overseas cash and bought back a fifth of its shares over the past five years. As a result, its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew at a CAGR of 10% from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023.\nOracle's slow but steady growth made it an appealing stock to own as the market was rattled by the pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical conflicts over the past five years. Analysts expect its revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 8% and 23%, respectively, from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026 as the macroenvironment improves.\nOracle currently trades at 29 times forward earnings. If it maintains that multiple, matches analysts' expectations through fiscal 2026, and continues to grow its EPS at a reasonable CAGR of 15% from fiscal 2026 to 2030, its stock could be trading at about $290 per share with a market cap of $800 billion by the beginning of the final year.\nThat would represent a respectable gain of 150% from its current price, but it would still be less than half the size of Alphabet today. Alphabet -- which is expected to grow its revenue and EPS at a CAGR of 11% and 16%, respectively, from 2023 to 2025 -- should also become much larger by 2030 as it expands its advertising and cloud-infrastructure platforms. Therefore, it seems unlikely that Oracle will join the trillion-dollar club or be worth more than Alphabet by the end of the decade.\nOracle might not be mentioned in the same breath as the FAANG stocks anytime soon, but it's still a sound investment for long-term investors. Its dominance of the database-software market, the expansion of its cloud-based ecosystem, its big buybacks, and its decent forward-dividend yield of 1.4% should help it ride out the macroheadwinds.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Oracle wasn't one of them.

        "Author": "  Yashwardhan Jain ",
        "Text": "Alphabet GOOGL reported its fourth-quarter 2023 earnings results on Jan 30 after market close. The tech giant reported earnings of $1.64 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates of $1.60 by 2.5%. GOOGL has a Zacks Growth Score of A.\nAlphabet posted revenues of $86.31 billion for the quarter ended December 2023, increasing at the most rapid expansion rate of 13% year over year since the beginning of 2022. GOOGL, which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $70.77 billion, reflecting a 21.96% positive surprise.\nNet income of $20.69 billion surged 51.9% from the year-ago quarter. Operating profit also rose 3% year over year, reaching 27%.\nAdvertisement revenues for the company increased about 10.97% year over year, reaching $65.52 billion in the fourth quarter, but trailed analyst estimates, according to CNBC. The disappointing ad revenues indicate rising competition for ad budgets from alternative online platforms.\nAccording to Thomas Monteiro, an analyst at Investing.com, as quoted on Reuters, the tech giant\u2019s sluggish ad revenues are indicative of the uncertainty regarding the pace of interest rate cuts by global central banks.\nThe earnings results have a huge impact on ETFs heavily invested in this Internet giant, with shares of GOOGL falling 5.78% after market hours, following its fourth-quarter earnings results. Here, we have highlighted four ETFs with double-digit exposure to Alphabet and look at how the funds have performed since earnings were reported.\nIShares Global Comm Services ETF seeks to track the performance of the S&P Global 1200Communication Services 4.5/22.5/45 Capped Index, with a basket of 65 securities.

        "Title": "Better Tech Stock: Alphabet vs. Apple",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The tech industry is vast, encompassing everything from consumer products like smartphones and video game consoles to artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, e-commerce, digital advertising, and a whole lot more. It has earned a reputation for rewarding innovative companies and their investors with consistent and significant gains over the long term, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector up more than 150% since 2019.\nAs a result, it's no surprise many stockholders have dedicated substantial portions of their portfolios to the high-growth market. In fact, Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathway has invested nearly 50% of its portfolio in tech stocks, enjoying a 20% compound annual gain between 1965 and 2022.\nSo, it's not a bad idea to expand your position in tech and add some new companies to your list of holdings. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are two attractive options, among the most prominent names in the industry.\nLet's look at these two businesses and determine whether Alphabet or Apple is currently the better tech stock.\nAlphabet enjoyed a stellar growth year in 2023, delivering significant gains in its digital ad business and strengthening its position in AI.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, Alphabet posted revenue growth of 11% year over year, beating Wall Street forecasts by $980 million. The rise was mainly due to improvements in its advertising segments, represented by an 11% increase in Google Search revenue and 12% growth from YouTube ads.\nThe digital ad market is projected to hit $740 billion in 2024, with Alphabet responsible for about 25% of that. Popular brands like Google, Android, and YouTube attract billions of users, presenting almost endless advertising opportunities. Meanwhile, their popularity will likely prove useful as Alphabet expands in AI.\nLast month, the company unveiled its highly anticipated AI model, Gemini. The new model is expected to be competitive with OpenAI's GPT-4 and could bolster Alphabet's venture in the market. With Gemini, Alphabet could create a more dynamic Google Search experience, more efficiently analyze video trends on YouTube, and improve its various productivity services.\nAlphabet's free cash flow rose 29% over the last year to $77 billion. Alongside a powerful position in tech, the company has the financial resources to continue investing in its business and deliver significant growth over the long term.\nApple seemed to hit roadblock after roadblock last year. Its revenue dipped 3% year over year in fiscal 2023 as macroeconomic headwinds caught up with its business and led to declines in product sales.\nThen, toward the end of 2023, the company was forced to pull its latest Apple Watches from U.S. shelves due to potential patent infringements. Meanwhile, the Chinese government increased restrictions on workers using iPhones. As a result, the tech giant is starting 2024 with its work cut out for it.\nHowever, it's not all bad news. Apple's digital services segment, the second-highest-earning part of its business, has remained a bright spot. Services posted revenue growth of 9% for the fiscal year, significantly outperforming all other segments.\nMeanwhile, Apple still achieved nearly $100 billion in free cash flow in 2023, proving it can overcome current headwinds and invest in its research and development. The company has some exciting developments in 2024, including venturing into the virtual/augmented reality market for the first time with a new headset and a gradual expansion in AI.\nApple remains one of the biggest names in tech, and I wouldn't bet against its long-term success.\nAlphabet and Apple are leaders in their respective industries and are part of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech companies for a reason. However, just because a company dominates a market doesn't necessarily mean it's the right time to buy its stock.\nThese charts show Alphabet is the cheaper option based on three different valuation metrics. The Google parent's lower figures suggest its stock currently offers far more value than Apple. Alongside a better performance in 2023 and a firmer position in the rapidly expanding AI market, Alphabet is the better tech stock this month.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\nSee the 10 stocks\n\u00a0\n*Stock Advisor returns as of December 18, 2023\n\u00a0\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "Title": "Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft Face FTC Inquiry on AI Partners",
        "Author": "  Leah Nylen ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. received inquiries from the US Federal Trade Commission on their investments and partnerships with artificial intelligence startups Anthropic and OpenAI, part of a study on how AI is impacting competition in the technology industry.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nMusk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain\nTech Giants Drop in Late Trading After Earnings: Markets Wrap\nUPS CEO Kicks Off Productivity Drive by Cutting 12,000 Managers\nTraders Line Up for \u2018Once-in-a-Generation\u2019 Emerging Markets Bet\nBlackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers\nThe antitrust and consumer protection agency on Thursday said it sent subpoenas to the companies to gather information. The probe focuses on more than $19 billion in investments by Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet\u2019s Google, a series of transactions that cemented alliances between the world\u2019s cloud-services giants and the leading developers of artificial intelligence software.\nAntitrust enforcers across the world have become concerned as many of the most promising AI startups now depend heavily on the old guard of dominant tech companies for their financing and infrastructure needs.\nIn comments during a public workshop Thursday, FTC Chair Lina Khan said the agency is closely monitoring the industry and warned that AI companies \u201ccannot use claims of innovation as cover for law breaking.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no AI exemption from the laws on the books,\u201d she said.\nGoogle said it doesn\u2019t have exclusive rights to Anthropic\u2019s technology, and its investment doesn\u2019t include a board seat or voting rights.\n\u201cWe hope the FTC\u2019s study will shine a bright light on companies that don\u2019t offer the openness of Google Cloud,\u201d said Peter Schottenfels, a company spokesperson.\nMicrosoft said the US is a leader in artificial intelligence because of collaborations between American companies.\n\u201cPartnerships between independent companies like Microsoft and OpenAI, as well as among many others, are promoting competition and accelerating innovation,\u201d said Rima Alaily, Microsoft\u2019s top competition lawyer. \u201cWe look forward to providing the FTC with the information it needs to complete its study.\u201d\nAmazon and Anthropic declined to comment. OpenAI didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nThe inquiry comes as technology giants take a bigger role in backing nimble AI startups in a bid to stake a claim in the booming sector. Over the past year, Microsoft has revamped nearly all of its products around AI tools powered by OpenAI\u2019s technology, while Google has said it plans to embed its most powerful large language model, Gemini, into its experimental search tool sometime this year.\nMicrosoft has invested more than $13 billion in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The ouster and subsequent reinstatement of Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s chief executive officer, in November exposed how inextricably linked Microsoft and the company have become. Those ties have already spurred antitrust reviews in both the UK and the European Union.\nMeanwhile, Google in October committed to back Anthropic with $2 billion, and Amazon last year also agreed to an investment of as much as $4 billion. Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, who left that company amid differences over the direction of the business.\nRead More: Big Tech\u2019s Massive AI Startup Deals, By the Numbers\nRebecca Kelly Slaughter, one of the FTC\u2019s three Democrats, criticized the tech giants for structuring their transactions in a way designed to avoid the US merger law that would have required them to notify antitrust enforcers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to wonder whether these investments could lead to a heavily consolidated market dominated by only a few,\u201d she said at the same workshop where Khan spoke.\nBut, she warned, \u201cstudying a market is a compliment to, and not a substitute for, appropriate enforcement.\u201d\nMicrosoft didn\u2019t report the OpenAI transaction to the agency because the investment doesn\u2019t amount to control of the company under US law, Bloomberg has reported. OpenAI is also a nonprofit, and acquisitions of non-corporate entities aren\u2019t reported under US merger law, regardless of value.\nIn the case of Google and Amazon, the deals were structured as convertible notes, a type of debt that will convert to equity at the startup\u2019s next funding round. Those don\u2019t require notification to the agency until they\u2019re converted.\nThe FTC is conducting the inquiry under its so-called 6(b) authority that allows it to issue subpoenas to conduct market studies. The agency generally issues a report on its findings after analyzing the information from companies, though that process can take years to complete. The agency is still finalizing the results of studies on pharmaceutical middlemen and supply chains that it started in 2021 and 2022.\nAlthough the information is collected for research purposes, the FTC can use any details it gleans to open official investigations or aid in existing probes. Last summer, the agency opened an investigation into whether OpenAI has violated consumer protection laws with its popular ChatGPT conversational AI bot.\nThe FTC and its sister agency, the Justice Department, share jurisdiction over antitrust probes and have been debating internally which should take the lead on AI. The Justice Department has generally handled antitrust issues related to Microsoft since its blockbuster monopolization case against the Windows maker in the late 1990s. The FTC, however, recently handled Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of game developer Activision Blizzard Inc.\nIn addition, the European Commission is looking into some of the agreements that have been struck between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers. The EU\u2019s executive arm is investigating the impact of these partnerships on market dynamics. The UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority said in December that it also would probe Microsoft and OpenAI\u2019s partnership.\n--With assistance from Shirin Ghaffary, Julia Love, Matt Day and Jackie Davalos.\n(Updates with Google and Microsoft statements beginning in sixth paragraph. An earlier version\u2019s ninth paragraph was corrected to show that Amazon invested in Anthropic in 2023, not this year.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThere\u2019s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets\nBasketball, Basketball, Basketball: Inside Steve Ballmer\u2019s New $2 Billion Arena\nHow to Handle the Dreaded Political Shop Talk at Work\nHow a Lucky Break Fueled Eli Lilly\u2019s $600 Billion Weight-Loss Empire\nAI Needs So Much Power That Old Coal Plants Are Sticking Around\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 January 29, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN.\nTech stocks have maintained their market leadership in the New Year, building on last year's standout performance. Driving this momentum has been a combination of favorable developments on the macro front, primarily growing confidence that the Fed is on track to start easing policy, having subdued inflation without endangering the economy.\nMore specific to the Tech sector is optimism about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) that some view warily as reminiscent of the late 1990s and an emerging sense we are getting close to putting the worst of Tech spending headwinds behind us.\nWith many Tech companies on deck to report December-quarter results this week, the market will be looking for more color on business spending trends, particularly on the cloud side.\nA big part of Tech's improved earnings outlook in 2023 was a function of more effective cost controls that helped stabilize margins. Improved clarity on top-line trends will help solidify the favorable revisions trend and undergird the group's impressive stock market momentum.\nOn top of it all is the AI debate, where we have already seen direct revenue impact from the likes of Nvidia and some ideas from Microsoft. Still, the innovation's productivity-enhancing potential appears to be some ways off in the future.\nThe stock market is essentially a discounting system of the future. To the extent that we see viable business models in the days ahead that make use of AI and the so-called large language models, beyond Nvidia selling more capable chips and Microsoft starting to charge for new AI-driven bells and whistles in its Office productivity suite, the stock market excitement would be totally justified.\nThese topics will be front and center in this week's earnings reports from five of the 'Big 7 Tech players' - Alphabet and Microsoft after the market's close on Tuesday (1/30), Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple after the close on Thursday (02/01). Of the remaining two members of this 'club,' Tesla has reported already, and Nvidia's results will be coming out at the end of February.\nApple shares may not have had as impressive a showing as the other distinguished members of this club, but it has nevertheless been a standout performer. The bigger question in the Apple story appears to be the China outlook, though headlines about the watch line may have also weighed on sentiment.\nDigital advertising has historically been seen as core to Alphabet and Meta, but Amazon has steadily become a major player in the space as well. Ad spending has stabilized in the last couple of quarters, and it will be interesting to see how these management teams see trends for the current and coming periods, given the macroeconomic uncertainties. This will also be at play in the Snap report, which reports Q4 results the following week (February 6th).\nAll of these companies are big players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, with the Microsoft vs. Alphabet rivalry particularly intense. With the initial excitement around ChatGPT and other AI applications now behind us, the questions now center around how these AI capabilities will be monetized through new and existing business models. It is reasonable to expect each of these management teams to spend considerable time on their Q4 earnings calls on their AI plan.\nThe group is expected to bring in +38.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues. Please note that these expectations have steadily increased in recent months.\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled-forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. As you can see above, the expectation is for the group to be firmly back in the 'regular/normal' growth model, but much of that is contingent on how the macroeconomic picture unfolds.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.3% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues.\nAs was the case with the 'Big 7 Tech Players,' the Tech sector as a whole has been dealing with the pulled-forward revenues and earnings during Covid over the last many quarters. In fact, earnings growth for the Zacks Tech sector turned positive only in 2023 Q2 after remaining in negative territory during the four quarters prior to that.\nThis big-picture view of the 'Big 7 players' and the overall sector shows that the worst of the growth challenge has moved into the rearview mirror.\nThe 2023 Q4 earnings are expected to be up +1.1% on +2.4% higher revenues. This follows the +3.8% earnings growth reading we saw in the preceding period (2023 Q3) and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings prior to that.\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, January 26th, we now have Q4 results from 124 S&P 500 members, or 24.8% of the index's total membership.\nWe have over 300 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned mega-tech players, this week's line-up includes a who's who of the index, including Boeing, Pfizer, International Paper, Starbucks, Exxon, Chevron, and many others.\nTotal Q4 earnings for the 124 index members that have reported already are down -0.4% from the same period last year on +3.4% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 69.4% beating revenue estimates.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Breaking Down the Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard \nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results.Also, strong focus on innovation of AI techniques and the home automation space should aid business growth in the long term. Further, its deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind.

        "Title": "Why Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates Again",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry.\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 7.99%, on average, in the last two quarters.\nFor the last reported quarter, Alphabet Inc. Came out with earnings of $1.55 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.45 per share, representing a surprise of 6.90%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.44 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.09%.\nFor Alphabet Inc.Estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nAlphabet Inc. Has an Earnings ESP of +15.16% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.\nInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
