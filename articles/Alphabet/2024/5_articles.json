        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-05-13, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $204.91. It's currently trading at a price of $168.65. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 17.7%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.56\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.49%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 21.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n113.19\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n118.01\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n204.91\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $164.25. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -2.68%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has come a long way since its founding in 1998, when the company went solely by Google. The tech giant has become a behemoth in the industry by essentially creating a gateway to the internet, amassing billions of users. Alphabet has used its vast network to branch out to multiple markets, including digital advertising, productivity software, cloud computing, smartphones, and more.\nThe company's success has seen its quarterly revenue, operating income, and stock price deliver triple-digit growth since 2019. Meanwhile, recent earnings indicate Alphabet is nowhere near hitting its ceiling. With a lucrative ad business and growth catalysts in multiple other markets, the company could have much more to offer new investors over the long term.\nSo, here's why Alphabet stock could help you become a millionaire.\nIn-house brands, like Android, YouTube, Chrome, and the many products under Google, have generated almost endless advertising opportunities for Alphabet. As a result, the company has achieved a leading 26% market share in digital ads, an industry Statista projects to hit $740 billion in spending this year.\nAlphabet's digital ad business accounts for about 80% of its revenue. The company's dependency on ads left it vulnerable to macroeconomic headwinds in 2022 as spikes in inflation forced businesses to cut ad spending. However, market improvements have shown that Alphabet's advertising division remains a fruitful long-term venture.\nOn April 25, the company posted its first-quarter 2024 earnings, where revenue rose 15% year over year and beat Wall Street estimates by almost $2 billion. Alphabet benefited from an uptick in ad sales, represented by a 14% increase in its Google Services revenue. Operating income for the segment climbed 28% year over year.\nDigital ad spending is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of about 10% through 2033, suggesting Alphabet will continue to see gains from the market for years.\nIn addition to advertising, Alphabet is gradually expanding its role in artificial intelligence (AI) to stay competitive with rivals Microsoft and Amazon.\nOver the last year, Alphabet added a range of new AI tools to its cloud platform, Google Cloud, and launched an AI model called Gemini. Analysts were wary of the company's AI prospects at first, with less cloud market share than Microsoft and Amazon and a fumbled launch for Gemini. However, Q1 2024 earnings have seemingly tempered concerns for now.\nDuring the quarter, Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue increased by 28% year over year while operating income soared 371% to $900 million.\nMoreover, Alphabet is working to bolster other areas of its business with AI, including using Gemini to offer more cost-efficient and effective advertising. Meanwhile, on May 14, the company announced major changes to Google Search, launching new generative AI features. The revamped search engine is designed to deliver more complete and direct answers to customers' questions.\nAdvertising remains the company's bread and butter, but AI appears set to play a major role in its future.\nAlphabet executives illustrated a major vote of confidence during a recent earnings call by announcing its first-ever dividend. On April 25, the company revealed plans to buy back $70 billion worth of stock and offer a dividend of $0.20 per share.\nThe move comes three months after advertising rival Meta Platforms announced its first-ever dividend. However, Alphabet's free cash flow of $69 billion compared to Meta's $50 billion suggests the Google company is better equipped to continue offering its dividend and keep investing in its business over the long term.\nAdditionally, this chart shows Alphabet is one of the best-valued stocks in AI and the cloud market. The company has a significantly lower forward price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash flow than Microsoft or Amazon, making its stock a bargain compared to its peers.\nAlongside Alphabet's booming ad business and promising venture into AI, the company's stock is worth considering. With the right investment, it could make patient stockholders millionaires.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is Alphabet a Good Dividend Stock?",
        "Author": "  Robert Izquierdo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Dividend-paying tech stocks were once a rare breed. But this year big names in tech have suddenly started offering dividends. For example, Salesforce and Facebook parent Meta Platforms both initiated dividends in February.\nJoining them is Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), which implemented a dividend for the first time in April. As one of the largest companies in the world, with a market cap over $2 trillion, Alphabet possesses the ability to make this move, especially in light of its smaller tech brethren doing so.\nNow that it's paying dividends, does Alphabet make a good income stock? Considering an investment in the tech giant based on its dividend requires taking a deeper look into the company.\nOne reason why Alphabet can afford to pay a dividend is its remarkable ability to generate free cash flow (FCF). A company uses FCF for activities such as investing in its business, paying debt, performing share buybacks, and funding a dividend.\nIn the first quarter, Alphabet produced FCF of $16.8 billion. To get a sense of how much this is, let's contrast Alphabet against tech veteran IBM, which paid dividends since 1916.\nIBM's Q1 FCF was $1.9 billion, and it produced a total of $11.8 billion over the trailing 12 months. This is dwarfed by Alphabet's massive FCF in Q1 alone.\nNot only that, Alphabet's impressive FCF generation has only grown stronger in recent years.\nThis is thanks to the company's slew of successful businesses fueled primarily by advertising dollars. In Q1, ad sales accounted for $61.7 billion of Alphabet's $80.5 billion in total revenue.\nAlphabet's FCF generation is likely to remain strong, helping to ensure its dividend remains in place. After all, it owns Google, but the corporation also has a potent streaming service in YouTube, and a thriving cloud computing business in Google Cloud.\nYouTube achieved revenue of $8.1 billion from advertising in Q1, an increase over the previous year's $6.7 billion. It also generates an undisclosed sum from subscription fees to services such as YouTube Music.\nGoogle Cloud is one of the top three cloud computing vendors in the world, and its market share has steadily risen in recent years. It pulled in $9.6 billion in Q1 sales, up from $7.5 billion in 2023.\nWith ownership of several multi-billion dollar businesses, Alphabet's financials are strong. It exited Q1 with $402.4 billion in total assets on its balance sheet versus $119 billion in total liabilities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $110.9 billion.\nAlphabet's financial strength means its dividend is reliable, but there's another component to consider with an income investment: the dividend yield.\nAlphabet initiated a $0.20-per-share dividend, currently yielding 0.5%. For comparison, IBM pays $1.67 per share with a yield of 3.8%. So in comparison, Alphabet's dividend is lacking.\nIn addition, because Alphabet only began dividend payments this year, there's no history to gauge whether those payments will increase in the future, or how often. Typically, companies raise dividends annually, but every business is different.\nRight now, all that's known about how the firm will approach its dividend is Alphabet stating, \"The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future.\"\nThat said, its dividend isn't the only consideration for an investment in Alphabet stock. Factors such as its growth prospects and competitive strength should also play a role in a decision to invest.\nFor instance, IBM possesses the superior dividend payout compared to Alphabet, but this rival to Google Cloud has a 2% share of the cloud computing market. Meanwhile, Google Cloud holds a far greater 11% share.\nAdding to the strength of its products, Alphabet is now investing in artificial intelligence. It included AI in its search engine. YouTube uses AI to check its vast video catalog for policy violations. Google Cloud serves as a distribution mechanism for Alphabet's AI products, allowing customers to use the technology for their own businesses.\nSo while Alphabet is not among the best dividend stocks, with many other choices serving as superior sources of passive income, it is still a good overall investment. Its strong suite of products, fantastic financials and FCF generation, and rising revenue make Alphabet an excellent growth stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The big story in the stock market over the past few years has been artificial intelligence (AI). Generative AI, which can create text, images, videos, and audio, looks likely to be a transformative technology. Tech leaders like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Advanced Micro Devices are betting heavily on AI to drive growth.\nWhile the stocks of all three of those AI-centric companies have surged over the past year, they have been beaten handily by a stock that has absolutely nothing to do with AI. Investing is about more than chasing buzzwords. The tried-and-true method of finding unappreciated companies with solid growth prospects trading at pessimistic valuations still works.\nThis mystery stock has more than doubled over the past year, beating all three of the aforementioned tech companies by large margins. It has also trounced Microsoft, Alphabet, and AMD over the past three years, nearly tripling in that time.\nThe stock is Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ: SFM), a small chain of grocery stores that does things differently from the major supermarket chains. That strategy has been paying off, and Sprouts still has plenty of growth ahead as it expands its footprint.\nSprouts operated 414 stores in 23 states as of March 31. Each store is relatively small. Its older stores are around 30,000 square feet, while its newer stores are even smaller at approximately 23,000 square feet. While the size of traditional supermarkets varies, they're often substantially larger.\nKeeping its stores small reduces the cost of building new stores, lowers the ongoing operating costs, and allows Sprouts to build in locations where larger supermarkets wouldn't make sense. The average new store costs just $3.8 million. First-year sales average $13 million, with 20% to 25% annual growth over the following four years.\nSprouts focuses on two things: produce and attribute-based items. Each store features a large produce section with affordable prices. It makes a point to beat competitors on price.\nAbout 70% of the products Sprouts sells are attribute-based -- meaning gluten-free, organic, vegan, non-GMO, and the like. It doesn't try to compete with the big supermarket chains on selection, instead curating a differentiated assortment of products. This works well with the company's customer base, which skews toward the wealthy and college-educated.\nThe Sprouts model is working. Comparable-store sales (comps) were up 4% in the first quarter of this year, and the company expects 3% to 4% comps growth for the full year. Adjusted earnings per share will top $3 this year, according to the company's guidance, up from just $1.25 in 2019.\nSprouts will open 35 new stores this year. In 2025 and beyond, the company plans to increase its store count by about 10% annually. It sees opportunities to open more than 300 new stores in its expansion markets, which include Texas, California, Florida, and portions of the East Coast.\nBased on the company's guidance, the stock trades for about 25 times forward earnings even after the multiyear rally that has propelled shares to market-trouncing gains. With the company expecting 10% store growth, low single-digit comps growth, and stable profit margins, double-digit annual earnings growth is in the cards.\nThat valuation looks reasonable given the chain's growth potential. It could also be an acquisition target. Amazon snagged Whole Foods, another differentiated grocery chain, in 2017. Sprouts could be an attractive acquisition for a larger chain hunting for growth.\nThe grocery industry is tough, and consumer behavior can shift unexpectedly. Sprouts is navigating the post-pandemic environment well so far, and the company looks poised to greatly expand its footprint in the coming years. While the stock might not repeat its performance from the past few years, it looks like a solid long-term investment.\nBefore you buy stock in Sprouts Farmers Market, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Sprouts Farmers Market wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Online services giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has made plenty of millionaires over the years. You'd have more than a million dollars in the Google parent's stock today if you invested just $15,000 when it entered the public stock market in 2004. If you put the same cash to work in a broad market tracker like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY) instead, you'd have a total return of just $105,000:\nBut you can build a million-dollar portfolio without market-crushing stars. Take the index tracker's compound average returns of 10.3% over that 20-year period, commit to making a modest investment every month, and let it run for a few more years.\nFor example, imagine setting up an automatic investment of $100 per month at the age of 20. There's no seed money to start that portfolio, no contribution increases over time, and you're sticking with that S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index tracker, automatically reinvesting its dividends in more shares of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) along the way.\n$100 a month isn't nothing, but the commitment is arguably small enough to work for most people with a day job. 44 years later, at the reasonable retirement age of 64, you will have invested a grand total of $52,800 in a simple index ETF. And thanks to the magic of compound returns, you'd have about $1.07 million in your retirement account.\nMany diversified mutual funds or ETFs can handle a long-term investment like the example above. Set it, forget it, and laugh all the way to the bank after a few decades.\nBut very few single stocks can carry that load. Oceans rise, empires fall, and even the most robust giants aren't immune to unexpected downturns, shifting consumer tastes, and technological progress. Let's check out a couple of examples.\nAt the turn of the millennium, General Electric (NYSE: GE) boasted the second-largest market cap of all at $508 billion. By now, the industrial empire has split into three separate companies whose market caps add up to about half of the January 2000 footprint.\nEnron or Lehman Brothers are more dramatic examples of crumbling empires, and the list is long. Among the 1,925 stocks in the Russell 2000 index, only 640 have a stock market history of at least 25 years.\nOnce, I bought a couch with a lifetime warranty from what had once been the largest department store of all. Six months and a bad holiday season later, Montgomery Ward filed for bankruptcy and liquidated the whole business. the company couldn't handle the one-two punch of big-box retailers and the early years of online shopping. So much for lifetime warranties.\nIn light of these examples, it's clear that very few companies can be expected to thrive over several decades. However, there are exceptions to the rule -- and I believe Alphabet is one of those rare survivors.\nBuilt to thrive in a variety of economic environments thanks to the ultra-flexible Alphabet umbrella organization, Alphabet has the ability to expand and explore in many different industries. If the online search and advertising revenues dry up, Alphabet would rely on the Android smartphone, YouTube video platform, and Google Cloud decentralized computing service in the short term. Meanwhile, promising side gigs like the Waymo self-driving taxi service, Calico medical research group, or Verily health data unit could pick up the long-term baton. Or maybe Google Cloud will just run with it instead, powered by its artificial intelligence expertise.\nAlphabet's portfolio of potential business stars will change over time, and I probably haven't even seen their best ideas yet. And that's exactly why I think the company is ready to run for decades to come. I don't recommend putting your entire nest egg in one basket, unless that basket holds a diversified fund -- but if you absolutely have to do it, Alphabet's stock is at the top of my candidates list.\nA flexible business model and proven success in building strong technology solutions position Alphabet to match or even exceed the S&P 500's long-term returns. And if the stock can indeed outperform the average S&P 500 returns in the long run, you'll reach your million-dollar retirement goal even faster.\nAnd a small boost to the return rate would make a big difference in 44 years -- beating the Street's average returns by a single percentage point gives you a $1.5 million portfolio in the end:\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Generative AI is on the ballot at Big Tech companies like Meta and Alphabet, as shareholders vote on proposals calling for detailed reports by the companies about how the technology is being used to create and spread misinformation. The shareholder proposals, which will be voted on at each company\u2019s upcoming annual general meeting, reflect growing concerns about the power and prevalence of generative AI.\nThe votes come as Google has faced massive blowback over the past week for its new search AI features, which has produced false and often bizarre responses, including telling users to put glue on pizza. Audio and video deepfakes created by AI technology are also proliferating online, raising concerns in an election year.\nShareholders in Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, will vote at the company\u2019s annual meeting on Wednesday, while investors in Google-parent company Alphabet will weigh in at the company\u2019s annual meeting on June 7. The resolutions come just a few months after a similar proposal at Microsoft\u2019s AGM on December 7, 2023, which was presented by Nirvana co-founder and bassist Krist Novoselic and garnered 21% of the shareholder vote.\nThe three proposals were led by ESG activist investor group Arjuna Capital and focus on concerns that generative AI threatens to amplify misinformation and disinformation around the world, particularly during a critical election year in countries like the US and India. A separate shareholder proposal brought to Apple focused on the risks of AI to workers, which was filed by the AFL-CIO Equity Index Funds, the largest labor union federation in the US. While the proposal was ultimately voted down by Apple shareholders at its annual meeting in February, proponents of AI transparency won a victory beforehand when the SEC ruled that companies like Apple could not bar shareholders from voting on such matters.\nIn the proxy statement for Meta's annual meeting, the shareholder proposal states that \"with Meta\u2019s recent development of gAI products, including conversational assistants and advertising tools, the company is increasingly at risk from misinformation and disinformation generated through its own products.\"\nThe proposal calls for the Meta board to \u201cissue a report, at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary or legally privileged information, to be published within one year of the Annual Meeting and updated annually thereafter, assessing the risks to the Company\u2019s operations and finances, and to public welfare, presented by the Company\u2019s role in facilitating misinformation and disinformation disseminated or generated via generative Artificial Intelligence; what steps the Company plans to take to remediate those harms; and how it will measure the effectiveness of such efforts.\u201d\nIn its response urging shareholders to reject the proposal, Meta pointed to its \u201cfive pillars of Responsible AI\u201d which are overseen by its board of directors, as well as its investments in safety and security efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation.\n\u201cGiven our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes that the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders,\u201d the Proxy Report said.\nIn a response to a similar proposal, Alphabet said that its Board of Directors recommended a vote against the stockholder proposal because \u201cOur enterprise risk frameworks, product policies, and tools provide a foundation for identifying and mitigating AI-generated mis/disinformation and other potential risks,\u201d adding that \u201cwe continually strive to improve the quality of our generative AI models and applications through both pre-launch testing and ongoing fine-tuning, and we are transparent about our ongoing work via public reporting.\u201d\nThe proposals for AI reports at Meta and Alphabet are unlikely to be approved, as both companies have dual class stock that concentrates the voting power in the hands of the founders. Still, the proposals carry symbolic power and have the potential to send a message to management if they earn widespread support from shareholders.\nAt December\u2019s Microsoft AGM, Novoselic served as the spokesperson for the shareholder initiative, describing himself as a long-time shareholder. He accused the company of racing forward, \u201creleasing this nascent technology without the appropriate guardrails.\u201d Generative AI, he continued, \u201cis a game-changer, there\u2019s no question, but the rush to market seemingly prioritizes short term profits over long-term success.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Will Ebiefung, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "With shares up by a healthy 59% over the last 12 months, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock is posting a healthy recovery after the slump it experienced in 2022. Like many technology companies, it is unwinding pandemic-era overexpansion while pivoting to new opportunities in generative artificial intelligence (AI). Let's discuss how the stock might perform over the next five years. \nInitially, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a boom for Alphabet as consumers spent more time online during the lockdowns and other restrictions. But the good times led to overexpansion as the company raced to enlarge its workforce. When demand softened, it was left with weaker margins and the need to make big changes. \nIn 2023, the worker-friendly tech giant axed a whopping 12,000 workers (6%) of its workforce. It also rolled back its famous office perks by cutting employee food, transportation, and fitness offerings (but before you feel too badly for them, remember that the average Googler still makes an average of $124,499 per year, according to Payscale). The belt-tightening has helped improve Alphabet's operating performance and put it in a great position to shift attention to new strategic opportunities.\nFirst-quarter revenue increased 15% year over year to $80.5 million, representing strong growth in segments like Google Search and YouTube, which represent its core advertising business. Alphabet is also experiencing healthy expansion in cloud services as clients turn to its cloud computing platform for training and running their AI algorithms. Total operating profit surged by 28% to $25.9 billion, which suggests the company's cost-cutting efforts are showing results. \nWhile Google Search and YouTube drove Alphabet's top-line growth in the first quarter, investors shouldn't necessarily expect this trend to continue. Google's search business is mature, with a market share of 82%. YouTube is also at or near its saturation point. Over the coming years, management will likely transition these segments from growth engines into cash cows -- reducing costs to maximize profits. \nAI will also play a significant role in Alphabet's future, especially because of its potential to synergize with legacy operations. The company's vast library of user-created content and search data from Google and YouTube could give it an edge in training generative AI algorithms. The new technology will continue to boost the cloud-computing segment as more enterprise clients turn to its platform to run their workloads. \nAccording to management, 70% of generative AI unicorns (start-ups valued at over $1 billion) chose Google Cloud, including well-known names like Anthropic, which creates algorithms, and Midjourney AI, which specializes in AI images. As these companies grow, they will likely spend more money on cloud services, turning this into a reliable growth driver for Alphabet. \nWhile Alphabet has historically been a growth stock, it is now making the slow transition into a value investment. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 22, shares are dirt cheap compared to other tech giants like Amazon or Nvidia, which trade for 41 and 37 times earnings, respectively. Alphabet can continue outperforming the market by keeping its operating costs low while raking in massive profits.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Nicholas Rossolillo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After a couple years of a bear market, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)\u00a0(NASDAQ: GOOGL)\u00a0stock has returned to all-time-highs in 2024. The latest surge higher comes on the back of another solid earnings report as the internet search titan seemingly prints cash quarter after quarter.\nIn this new bull market fueled by artificial intelligence (AI) computing infrastructure, Alphabet could have a massive advantage over the competition. It already has one of the world's most powerful installed base of computing power via a sprawling fleet of data centers and communications networks. As new ways to monetize AI are unlocked (like via the cloud, for example), Alphabet stock could still be a great buy for 2024 and beyond.\nFor Q1 2024, Alphabet's internet empire reported a 15% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue to $80.5 billion. That's all fine and well, but the real story here was the operating income profit margin, which increased from 25% in Q1 2023 to 32% in Q1 2024. The result was a massive 47% increase in operating profit to $25.5 billion, and 62% surge in earnings per share (EPS).\nWhat that means for shareholders is lots of cash returns. Alphabet has been going about returning excess cash via stock buybacks for years, but a first-ever quarterly dividend was also announced:\n$15.7 billion in share buybacks in Q1 2024 alone, or about 0.8% of Alphabet's market cap if you're looking for a dividend yield equivalent\nAnd a new quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share, currently good for an annualized yield of nearly 0.5%\nBesides more share buybacks and the dividend, Alphabet still gushes enough cash that it can continue to upgrade its sprawling global data centers. These days, you can think of the company as really having two massive compute engines at work: one for Google Search and related Google Services (including YouTube, which is primarily monetized via ads); and a second data center network for Google Cloud. Google Cloud and its long list of enterprise customer capabilities is still in high growth mode, contributing $9.57 billion in quarterly revenue in Q1 (up 28% year-over-year) and generating an operating margin of 9.4% (up from just 2.6% last year).\nThese data center upgrades aren't cheap. It involves purchasing AI systems from Nvidia, as well as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) from Alphabet's long-standing co-development project with Broadcom. These semiconductor and AI system purchases get filed under capital expenditures (CapEx). Google's total CapEx nearly doubled in Q1 compared to the year prior to a whopping $12 billion.\nBut again, the Google empire is printing plenty of cash to cover the bills. Additionally, it still has a mind-boggling sum of $108 billion in cash and short-term investments and another $34 billion in long-term investments on balance, offset by only $13.2 billion in debt.\nAll of this is to say Alphabet has an incredibly powerful installed base of computing power, and a stockpile of cash and epic quarterly free cash flow that enables the business to keep investing to sustain its lead.\nIn this market where the AI race is heating up, and investors are looking for a surefire payout from AI development, Alphabet has obvious advantages.\nAfter the last quarter's update, shares trade for a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22. It isn't a cheap stock, but given Alphabet's ability to invest in data center computing and turn that into higher profitability, this could still be a great portfolio addition for the long term.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has featured in countless headlines over the last year as it has delivered a solid turnaround in its digital advertising business and gradually expanded its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\nThe company's shares have climbed nearly 60% in the last twelve months, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. Meanwhile, Alphabet's most recent quarter (the first quarter of 2024) has shown signs that its heavy investment in AI is beginning to pay off.\nBrands like YouTube, Android, Chrome, and Google have made Alphabet a tech behemoth, garnering billions of users worldwide. The company has used its vast user base to build a lucrative advertising business. And now, the popularity of these platforms is providing Alphabet with multiple opportunities to boost its venture into AI.\nSo, here's why it's not too late to buy Alphabet's stock.\nAlphabet posted its Q1 2024 results on April 25, leading its stock to pop 6%. The company delivered promising earnings, with revenue rising 15% year over year to $81 billion.\nDuring the quarter, Alphabet enjoyed significant gains in its advertising division, with Google Services sales increasing by 14%. Macroeconomic headwinds hit the company's ad business hard in 2022 and at the start of 2023. However, recent earnings suggest these challenges have subsided.\nAbout 80% of Alphabet's revenue comes from its ad services. Yet, its biggest growth catalyst over the next decade will likely be its AI-focused cloud business with Google Cloud. The segment reported revenue growth of 28% year over year while operating income skyrocketed 371% to $900 million.\nAlphabet has gradually expanded its AI cloud services over the last year, launching its most powerful AI model, Gemini, in December 2023. The company's investment in generative technology is beginning to pay off as businesses increasingly use its services to integrate AI into their workflow.\nIn addition to a positive quarter, Alphabet announced plans to lay off at least 200 employees from its \"Core\" organization as part of its latest round of budget cuts. Like many tech companies moving past the economic downturn of 2022, Alphabet is prioritizing profitability and slashing anything it deems unnecessary, which only strengthens its outlook going forward.\nAlphabet has been slightly overshadowed in AI since last year as rivals Amazon and Microsoft appeared to get a better start in the industry. A fumbled launch for its AI model Gemini and the third largest market share in cloud computing (behind Amazon and Microsoft) concerned investors. However, Alpahbet's latest quarterly earnings have tempered those fears.\nAlphabet's cloud business appears to be taking off as it attracts more users, proven by its nearly 30% revenue growth and soaring profits. Meanwhile, expanded AI capabilities with its Gemini and other models will help the company bolster multiple areas of its business, such as offering more efficient advertising, creating a Search experience closer to OpenAI's ChatGPT, improving its productivity services, and even generative updates to Android. In fact, Alphabet announced AI-powered ads last year as it uses Gemini to enhance its ad solutions.\nThe company's reach in tech is vast, and with $69 billion in free cash flow, Alphabet has the brand power and financial resources to go far in AI. The tech giant announced last month it would invest $3 billion in building data centers in Indiana and Virginia as it works to strengthen Google Cloud. Additionally, Alphabet will spend $75 million to fuel its Google AI Opportunity Fund, which aims to teach Americans AI skills.\nMoreover, this chart shows Alphabet is potentially one of the best-valued AI stocks. The company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-free cash flow are among some of the lowest compared to Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. Forward P/E and price-to-free cash flow are helpful when determining a stock's value, as they consider a company's financial prospects. For both valuation metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value.\nAs a result, this chart indicates Alphabet shares are a bargain compared to its peers. And with arguably similar, if not more, potential in AI than these companies, Alphabet shares are a no-brainer. Despite having the third largest market share in cloud computing after Microsoft and Amazon, its free cash flow is similar to Microsoft's $70 billion and significantly more than Amazon's $46 billion, suggesting Alphabet has the financial resources to keep up with its rivals in the coming years.\nAdditionally, the billions of users that Alphabet's platforms attract could be leveraged to expand in AI, becoming a major growth driver in the commercial and public adoption of AI services.\nAlphabet's stock is up 536% in the last ten years. Yet, it appears nowhere near hitting its ceiling. Vast financial resources, an extensive user base, and positive quarterly results suggest it's not too late to invest in Alphabet and profit from its exciting future.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Google Parent Company Alphabet Just Proved Why Dividends Matter, Even for Growth Stocks",
        "Author": "  Daniel Foelber, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Just one quarter after Meta Platforms announced its first-ever dividend payout, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) joined Meta, Microsoft, and Apple to become the fourth \"Magnificent Seven\" company to reward shareholders with a quarterly dividend. Nvidia technically pays one too, but at a negligible 0.02% yield, it's a nonfactor to investors.\nAlphabet's dividend will start at just $0.20 per share, but the company said it intends to sustain this quarterly payout into the future, meaning it could build off this initial level.\nAt a share price of about $166 as of this writing, Alphabet's forward yield is 0.5%, on par with its Magnificent Seven peers.\nLet's discuss why dividends matter for big-tech companies and the other way Alphabet plans to directly reward its shareholders.\nDespite yielding just 0.8%, Microsoft pays out more cash in dividends than any other U.S.-based company: $20.7 billion in the past year. The company with the second largest amount of dividends paid is Apple at $15.1 billion. Meta's dividend expense should be about $5.1 billion in its first year, while Alphabet will pay out just shy of $10 billion.\nThat adds up to a combined $50 billion paid out annually to shareholders between the four companies. While that's a massive amount of capital, these companies tend to spend even more on stock buybacks.\nUsing profits to repurchase shares, even when the stock is trading near an all-time high, can benefit shareholders more than dividends in the long run. Shareholders owe taxes on dividend income but not buybacks. The latter also reduces the outstanding share count, increasing earnings per share and decreasing the company's dividend liability over time.\nDividends matter for mature growth stocks like Alphabet because they make the company a complete investment. The $0.80 per share in annual dividends looks trivial when Alphabet stock has nearly doubled since the start of 2023. However, a company's ability to pay a growing dividend and buy back stock when market sentiment is negative can be a reassuring and effective use of capital.\nIt's also worth mentioning that Alphabet's dividend could be way higher if it didn't buy back stock. Alphabet's board just authorized a $70 billion buyback program. Annualizing its $15.7 billion of share repurchases from the first quarter and adding the $10 billion of expected dividends results in a total of $72.8 billion going to its capital return program. That's good for a capital return yield of 3.4%, a much more generous yield than the dividend alone. This is the case for Meta, Microsoft, and Apple as well.\nAccounting for the full capital return program, not just dividends, better illustrates how much companies like Alphabet are returning to their shareholders.\nWith a market capitalization measured in the trillions, it's hard to believe a company as big as Alphabet can continue to outperform the broad market. But once you consider all the advantages of big tech companies, it's clear why the trend can continue.\nUnlike a stodgy dividend-paying company with limited growth prospects, Alphabet is a high-margin business with an excellent balance sheet. It has plenty of avenues to expand existing cash cows like YouTube, Google Search, Google Cloud, and Android, or invest in new opportunities like artificial intelligence.\nEven after a strong rally the past year, Alphabet trades at a 25.5 price-to-earnings ratio compared to 24.8 for the S&P 500. Future earnings growth, paired with buybacks, could lead to Alphabet once again trading at a discount to the broad market index.\nThe recent decision from Alphabet and Meta to start paying dividends marks a new age for big tech. Hovering near its all-time high, Alphabet remains a buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has come a long way since its founding in 1998, when the company went solely by Google. The tech giant has become a behemoth in the industry by essentially creating a gateway to the internet, amassing billions of users. Alphabet has used its vast network to branch out to multiple markets, including digital advertising, productivity software, cloud computing, smartphones, and more.\nThe company's success has seen its quarterly revenue, operating income, and stock price deliver triple-digit growth since 2019. Meanwhile, recent earnings indicate Alphabet is nowhere near hitting its ceiling. With a lucrative ad business and growth catalysts in multiple other markets, the company could have much more to offer new investors over the long term.\nSo, here's why Alphabet stock could help you become a millionaire.\nIn-house brands, like Android, YouTube, Chrome, and the many products under Google, have generated almost endless advertising opportunities for Alphabet. As a result, the company has achieved a leading 26% market share in digital ads, an industry Statista projects to hit $740 billion in spending this year.\nAlphabet's digital ad business accounts for about 80% of its revenue. The company's dependency on ads left it vulnerable to macroeconomic headwinds in 2022 as spikes in inflation forced businesses to cut ad spending. However, market improvements have shown that Alphabet's advertising division remains a fruitful long-term venture.\nOn April 25, the company posted its first-quarter 2024 earnings, where revenue rose 15% year over year and beat Wall Street estimates by almost $2 billion. Alphabet benefited from an uptick in ad sales, represented by a 14% increase in its Google Services revenue. Operating income for the segment climbed 28% year over year.\nDigital ad spending is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of about 10% through 2033, suggesting Alphabet will continue to see gains from the market for years.\nIn addition to advertising, Alphabet is gradually expanding its role in artificial intelligence (AI) to stay competitive with rivals Microsoft and Amazon.\nOver the last year, Alphabet added a range of new AI tools to its cloud platform, Google Cloud, and launched an AI model called Gemini. Analysts were wary of the company's AI prospects at first, with less cloud market share than Microsoft and Amazon and a fumbled launch for Gemini. However, Q1 2024 earnings have seemingly tempered concerns for now.\nDuring the quarter, Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue increased by 28% year over year while operating income soared 371% to $900 million.\nMoreover, Alphabet is working to bolster other areas of its business with AI, including using Gemini to offer more cost-efficient and effective advertising. Meanwhile, on May 14, the company announced major changes to Google Search, launching new generative AI features. The revamped search engine is designed to deliver more complete and direct answers to customers' questions.\nAdvertising remains the company's bread and butter, but AI appears set to play a major role in its future.\nAlphabet executives illustrated a major vote of confidence during a recent earnings call by announcing its first-ever dividend. On April 25, the company revealed plans to buy back $70 billion worth of stock and offer a dividend of $0.20 per share.\nThe move comes three months after advertising rival Meta Platforms announced its first-ever dividend. However, Alphabet's free cash flow of $69 billion compared to Meta's $50 billion suggests the Google company is better equipped to continue offering its dividend and keep investing in its business over the long term.\nAdditionally, this chart shows Alphabet is one of the best-valued stocks in AI and the cloud market. The company has a significantly lower forward price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash flow than Microsoft or Amazon, making its stock a bargain compared to its peers.\nAlongside Alphabet's booming ad business and promising venture into AI, the company's stock is worth considering.

        "Title": "Is Alphabet Actually Winning in AI? Here's What That Could Mean for the Stock.",
        "Author": "  Brett Schafer, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The tech arena is in the midst of a full-blown artificial intelligence (AI) boom. It seems like every company is doing something to take advantage of new AI advances, with leading computer chip provider Nvidia up hundreds of percentage points to a market cap of $2.5 trillion as of this writing. That is a lot of computing power.\nNo company is better poised to take advantage of the AI boom than Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of Google and YouTube. It may have the most data of any company in the world and billions of users. Yet a year ago investors were worried that Microsoft and OpenAI were far in the lead with these new chatbot tools, and that Alphabet was losing the race in AI.\nToday I think it's safe to say Alphabet has gained a lot of ground after its plethora of product announcements at the latest Google I/O event. Is Alphabet actually winning in AI now? Here's what that could mean for the stock.\nAlphabet's most important product is still Google Search, the dominant search engine used by billions around the globe with 90% market share. Now Google users will be getting generative AI search results when asking certain queries through its Gemini AI chatbot. This is not in every market yet, but is a step toward competing with upstart response query platforms like OpenAI and Perplexity. These responses are aimed to improve the value of Google Search, which will keep users from switching to places like Bing or OpenAI.\nPerhaps more important is how Alphabet will be integrating Gemini into other products. From Google Maps to Google Photos to its Pixel hardware devices, Alphabet products will be getting Gemini advancements to improve the customer value proposition. Essentially, Alphabet wants to make all of its platforms smarter for users, further separating them from the competition. Time will tell how truly valuable these advancements are (Amazon Alexa, I'm looking at you), but Alphabet is back on the offensive, pushing out dozens of AI products to customers.\nAI products are great, but anyone who has studied this industry knows that they require a ton of computing power. This is why Nvidia is now one of the largest companies in the world.\nLucky for Alphabet investors, the company has been investing in AI computing infrastructure for over a decade. It released an update to its Tensor chips -- a competitor to Nvidia -- with a 4.7x improvement in performance. It has its own Google Cloud unit that now does tens of billions in revenue and is powered by these chips.\nThis year Alphabet expects to spend $50 billion on capital expenditures, mainly for AI infrastructure. There are very few companies that could even match this spending, and Alphabet has been at this for a long time. This is why the company can spread its AI tools to all of its products and billions of users, while start-ups have to raise $1 billion to maintain a user base of tens of millions.\nShareholders should be applauding the forward-thinking nature of Alphabet's management. The company has the best AI infrastructure in the world, and is looking to improve it over the next few years as well.\nAll these AI products, but not a single focus on how to make money. That is what an investor might think when looking at these AI announcements from Alphabet.\nWhile it is true the company is not making much money directly from AI today, I think Alphabet is set up nicely to benefit from AI growth over the long haul. Google Cloud can outsource these AI tools to third parties, which can bring in tens of billions in revenue over the next few years. Generative AI search can have advertisements included in links, which will drive further growth at Google Search.\nAnd it is looking more and more likely that Google Search is not going to get disrupted by OpenAI, which was a major fear a year ago. With the stock at a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 27, shares are not too expensive if you believe these AI tools can drive revenue growth over the long haul. Investors in Alphabet should rest easy knowing it is now leading in AI.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) Hits Fresh High: Is There Still Room to Run?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) have been strong performers lately, with the stock up 13.2% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $178.77 in the previous session. Alphabet has gained 26.7% since the start of the year compared to the 16.9% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 22.6% return for the Zacks Internet - Services industry.\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on April 25, 2024, Alphabet reported EPS of $1.89 versus consensus estimate of $1.49 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.35%.\nFor the current fiscal year, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $7.61 per share on $295.53 billion in revenues. This represents a 31.21% change in EPS on a 15.21% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.65 per share on $329.71 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 13.68% and 11.57%, respectively.\nValuation Metrics\nAlphabet may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\nAlphabet has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 23.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is a premium to the peer industry average of 23.2X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 25.7X versus its peer group's average of 11.2X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.35. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\nZacks Rank\nWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Alphabet meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Alphabet shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.\nHow Does GOOGL Stack Up to the Competition?\nShares of GOOGL have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Dropbox, Inc. (DBX). DBX has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of A, and a Momentum Score of C.\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Dropbox, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 18.37%, and for the current fiscal year, DBX is expected to post earnings of $2.05 per share on revenue of $2.54 billion.\nShares of Dropbox, Inc. have gained 2.5% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 11.67X and a P/CF of 13.35X.\nThe Internet - Services industry is in the top 28% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for GOOGL and DBX, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Alphabet (GOOG) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this company a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 23.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 31.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 29.6%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Alphabet is 16.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -19.1%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.5%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Alphabet have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 12.7% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Alphabet a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Alphabet is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Investors looking for maximum returns should consider Alphabet GOOGL adding to their portfolios due to its solid fundamental strength.Shares of the search giant have risen 23.2% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 18.1% and the S&P 500 index\u2019s return of 11.5% during the same time frame.This outperformance reflects the company\u2019s back-to-back quarters of impressive financial performance. Alphabet\u2019s earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 11.3%. In its last reported quarter, the top and bottom lines beat the consensus mark and witnessed strong year-over-year growth.We believe that GOOGL shares have further room for expansion, given the company\u2019s growing efforts to bolster its generative AI capabilities. Its leading position in the search engine space, strengthening cloud footprint, solid momentum in YouTube and Android, and growing traction in the autonomous driving space should aid Alphabet\u2019s prospects further.The upswing in the company\u2019s estimates testifies to the aforesaid fact. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues and earnings is pegged at $295.53 billion and $7.61 per share, respectively.

These factors will continue to boost the search traffic on the Chrome browser.\nAlphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. Google Cloud has turned out to be the key growth driver of Alphabet, owing to strengthening cloud service offerings. The solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace has been driving growth in the Google Cloud segment.Google\u2019s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI are major positives.

        "Text": "When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For example, the Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) share price has soared 222% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. It's also good to see the share price up 25% over the last quarter.\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n View our latest analysis for Alphabet \nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nOver half a decade, Alphabet managed to grow its earnings per share at 27% a year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 26%. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Alphabet has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.\nIt's nice to see that Alphabet shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 38% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 26% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. Is Alphabet cheap compared to other companies?

        "Title": "Is Alphabet a Good Dividend Stock?",
        "Author": "  Robert Izquierdo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Dividend-paying tech stocks were once a rare breed. But this year big names in tech have suddenly started offering dividends. For example, Salesforce and Facebook parent Meta Platforms both initiated dividends in February.\nJoining them is Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), which implemented a dividend for the first time in April. As one of the largest companies in the world, with a market cap over $2 trillion, Alphabet possesses the ability to make this move, especially in light of its smaller tech brethren doing so.\nNow that it's paying dividends, does Alphabet make a good income stock? Considering an investment in the tech giant based on its dividend requires taking a deeper look into the company.\nOne reason why Alphabet can afford to pay a dividend is its remarkable ability to generate free cash flow (FCF). A company uses FCF for activities such as investing in its business, paying debt, performing share buybacks, and funding a dividend.\nIn the first quarter, Alphabet produced FCF of $16.8 billion. To get a sense of how much this is, let's contrast Alphabet against tech veteran IBM, which paid dividends since 1916.\nIBM's Q1 FCF was $1.9 billion, and it produced a total of $11.8 billion over the trailing 12 months. This is dwarfed by Alphabet's massive FCF in Q1 alone.\nNot only that, Alphabet's impressive FCF generation has only grown stronger in recent years.\nThis is thanks to the company's slew of successful businesses fueled primarily by advertising dollars. In Q1, ad sales accounted for $61.7 billion of Alphabet's $80.5 billion in total revenue.\nAlphabet's FCF generation is likely to remain strong, helping to ensure its dividend remains in place. After all, it owns Google, but the corporation also has a potent streaming service in YouTube, and a thriving cloud computing business in Google Cloud.\nYouTube achieved revenue of $8.1 billion from advertising in Q1, an increase over the previous year's $6.7 billion. It also generates an undisclosed sum from subscription fees to services such as YouTube Music.\nGoogle Cloud is one of the top three cloud computing vendors in the world, and its market share has steadily risen in recent years. It pulled in $9.6 billion in Q1 sales, up from $7.5 billion in 2023.\nWith ownership of several multi-billion dollar businesses, Alphabet's financials are strong. It exited Q1 with $402.4 billion in total assets on its balance sheet versus $119 billion in total liabilities. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $110.9 billion.\nAlphabet's financial strength means its dividend is reliable, but there's another component to consider with an income investment: the dividend yield.\nAlphabet initiated a $0.20-per-share dividend, currently yielding 0.5%. For comparison, IBM pays $1.67 per share with a yield of 3.8%. So in comparison, Alphabet's dividend is lacking.\nIn addition, because Alphabet only began dividend payments this year, there's no history to gauge whether those payments will increase in the future, or how often. Typically, companies raise dividends annually, but every business is different.\nRight now, all that's known about how the firm will approach its dividend is Alphabet stating, \"The company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future.\"\nThat said, its dividend isn't the only consideration for an investment in Alphabet stock. Factors such as its growth prospects and competitive strength should also play a role in a decision to invest.\nFor instance, IBM possesses the superior dividend payout compared to Alphabet, but this rival to Google Cloud has a 2% share of the cloud computing market. Meanwhile, Google Cloud holds a far greater 11% share.\nAdding to the strength of its products, Alphabet is now investing in artificial intelligence. It included AI in its search engine. YouTube uses AI to check its vast video catalog for policy violations.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 6th on our list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy for 2024 According to Billionaire David Tepper.\nClick to see 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy for 2024 According to Billionaire David Tepper.\nBillionaire David Tepper of Appaloosa Management recently made headlines when his latest portfolio showed the 66-year-old owner of Carolina Panthers was piling into Chinese stocks while clearly cutting his exposure to mega-cap tech stocks which have already rewarded him heftily over the past several quarters, thanks to the AI-led rally. Tepper's bet on Chinese stocks comes at a time when many analysts are predicting a rebound of Chinese economy as the government begins to devise more rescue plans for the devastated property sector. The MSCI China index is up about 10% since the end of March.\nDavid Tepper, who founded Appaloosa Management back in 1993, returned 20% last year, thanks to his huge stake in AI stocks. A cursory analysis of David Tepper, worth over $20 billion, shows that he was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn\u2019t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper's instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he'd joined in 1985.\nTepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the mist of the market crash of 1987. According to The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World's Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:\n\u201cGoing into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short\u2014I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,\u201d he says with a chuckle. \u201cIt was very cool.\u201d Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn\u2019t do as well. \u201cI still got a raise but not as much as I should have.\u201d\nBillionaire David Tepper Q1'2024 Stake Value: $315,939,500\nDavid Tepper first bought a stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the third quarter of 2024, gradually adding to his position over the years. However, the billionaire started decreasing his hold in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) significantly in 2021. In the first quarter, Appaloosa decreased its position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) by 10%. The fund still owns a $316 million stake in Alphabet Inc.

        "Title": "Is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) A Risky Investment?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.\n See our latest analysis for Alphabet \nThe chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Alphabet had US$11.9b in debt in March 2024; about the same as the year before. But it also has US$108.1b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$96.2b net cash.\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Alphabet had liabilities of US$77.0b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$37.5b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$108.1b in cash and US$44.6b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it can boast US$38.1b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nHaving regard to Alphabet's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$2.03t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Succinctly put, Alphabet boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\nOn top of that, Alphabet grew its EBIT by 34% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Alphabet can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. While Alphabet has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the most recent three years, Alphabet recorded free cash flow worth 80% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Alphabet has net cash of US$96.2b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And we liked the look of last year's 34% year-on-year EBIT growth. So is Alphabet's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all. If you've also come to that realization, you're in luck, because today you can view this interactive graph of Alphabet's earnings per share history for free.\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

        "Author": "  Grahamites ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced its earnings for the first quarter of 2024 on April 25. Both revenue and net income exceeded the relatively modest market expectations. In CEO Sundar Pichais words, Our results in the first quarter reflect strong performance from Search, YouTube and Cloud. We are well under way with our Gemini era and there's great momentum across the company. Our leadership in AI research and infrastructure, and our global product footprint, position us well for the next wave of AI innovation.\nPichai expressed his confidence in Alphabet's ability to continue to grow its core business and leverage its technology leadership in the artificial intelligence race. Along with the earnings release, the company also announced its first quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share as well as a new $70 billion authorization in share repurchases. Obviously investors cheered the results as Alphabet's market cap has reached all-time highs again.\nAlphabet's first-quarter revenue grew 15% to $80.50 billion, exceeding the market's expectation of $79 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 31% year over year to $26.20 billion and the adjusted operating margin was 33%, a considerable improvement from 29% in the prior-year quarter.\nOn a segment basis, both Google Services and Google Cloud saw strong revenue growth. Google Services segment revenue grew 14% year over year to $70.4 billion. Within the Google Service segment, Google Search and other advertising revenue grew 14%, subscription, platform and devices revenue grew 18% and YouTube advertising revenue grew 21%. The only negative impact of the Google Services segment was network advertising, which was down 1%. The Google Services segment's operating income grew 28% year over year and the operating margin was 40%.\nGoogle Cloud business also experienced very robust growth. Segment revenue for Google Cloud grew 28% to $9.60 billion for the quarter. Segment operating income was $900 million and segment operating margin was 9%. During the earnings call, President and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat explained that the growth in the Google Cloud business reflected significant growth in GCP with an increasing contribution from AI and strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat.\nThe most impressive part of Alphabet's first-quarter results is that the company achieved very high-quality revenue growth as its gross margin expanded to 58.14%. The last time Alphabet's gross margin surpassed 58% was in the third quarter of 2017 when its gross margin reached almost 60%. Alphabet's operating margin of 31.60% is also very high on a historical basis. This is the highest operating margin for the company since the fourth quarter of 2012.\nLike all big tech companies, Alphabet also bets heavily on AI. During the earnings call, Pichai laid out Alphabet's leadership in six areas when it comes to the technology: research leadership, infrastructure leadership, innovation in Search, global product footprint, velocity in execution, and monetization paths.\nHe also said that that Gemini 1.5 Proincludes a breakthrough in long context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model yet.\"\n\"Combining this with Gemini's native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text code and more, it's highly capable,\" he added. \"We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of things. Beyond Gemini, we have built other useful models, including our Gemma open models as well as image and visual models and others.\nOf the six areas that Pichai claims Alphabet has leadership, I am convinced the company is indeed a leader in research, infrastructure, innovation and global product footprint. After all, it did pioneer many of the modern breakthroughs that power the AI technology. According to Chatbot Arena, Alphabet's Gemini 1.5 Pro's ranking is tied at second.\nI am less convinced, though, that Alphabet can lead the AI race in terms of velocity in execution and monetization paths because, historically, speed of execution and monetization has not been its strength. But that may change as Pichai's leadership has set the tone for a company-wide effort to address complacency and sloth, both of which had been hindering Alphabet's speed of execution.\nIn a previous discussion regarding Alphabet's culture, I laid out the challenges the company was facing when it comes to employees' complacency and sloth. At the end of the piece, I wrote:\nFortunately, Sundar Pichai has realized the culture issues and has taken steps to address them. It remains to be seen whether he can successfully tackle them in the future.\nAlphabet's recent actions are encouraging signs that the management team has been very effective in its cost re-engineering efforts. Investors can feel the sense of urgency from the management team. For the first quarter, the number of global employees decreased by 5.10% year over year to approximately 181,000. It is expected that layoffs will continue in the second quarter.\nFurther, on May 1, CNBC reported, Google is laying off at least 200 employees from its Core' organization, which includes key teams and engineering talent, in a reorganization that will include moving some roles to India and Mexico. This is another sign that Alphabet's management team is determined to further improve efficiency while maintaining its technology leadership.\nI applaud Alphabet's management team for their sense of urgency and determination in terms of tackling its most daunting issues. They are making difficult decisions that may not be popular in the short term, but are crucial for the company's long-term future.\nAlphabet's first-quarter results handily beat investors' low expectations. But more importantly, the management team has showed investors they are determined to achieve high-quality growth. It is very encouraging to witness the steps they are taking to address its culture issues. While the journey ahead may be challenging, if the transformation is successful, Alphabet is likely to emerge stronger and more competitive in the long run.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Alphabet stock (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) surged over 10% after its Q1 announcement, marking a substantial post-earnings rally. Despite Alphabet being already one of my largest positions, its most recent report further solidified my confidence in the stock. With the company effortlessly beating Wall Street\u2019s estimates and posting double-digit growth across the board, shares continue to appear cheap, even after reaching new all-time highs. Consequently, I remain bullish on Alphabet stock.\nAlphabet\u2019s Q1 numbers marked an effortless beat against Wall Street\u2019s estimates, with the California-based tech giant posting double-digit growth across the board. Revenues soared to $80.5 billion, as you can see in the image below, topping consensus estimates by a wide margin of $1.84 billion. The 15% revenue growth also marked a significant acceleration from the previous year\u2019s growth of 3%. Further, EPS came in at $1.89, exceeding Street estimates by a significant margin of $0.38. Let\u2019s take a deeper look.\nAlphabet\u2019s impressive growth in Q1 was primarily fueled by the durable momentum of its AI-powered advertising solutions, driving revenues for both Google Search and YouTube. Consider the company\u2019s use of AI in smart bidding, for instance. It predicts future ad conversions, enabling businesses to swiftly adapt to shifting demand dynamics.\nMoreover, products like Broad Match leverage large language models to match ads to relevant searches and thus enable advertisers to respond to what millions of people are searching for. In other words, by utilizing Alphabet\u2019s AI solutions, businesses can now find users at speed and scale and drive improving ROI, which naturally translates to growing advertising dollars for the company. Evidently, Google Search revenues grew by 14% to $46.2 billion, while YouTube Ads revenues grew by 21% to $8.1 billion.\nThe exciting part is that most of Alphabet\u2019s AI solutions are only starting to roll out. We are way too early in the company\u2019s roadmap, meaning the best is yet to come. Take P-Max, for instance, which debuted in Gemini this past February. It\u2019s revolutionizing the creation of text and image assets, enabling businesses to promptly fulfill P-Max asset requirements.\nThe company claims that advertisers leveraging P-Max asset generation are 63% more likely to launch a campaign with outstanding ad strength. However, this functionality is currently exclusive to the U.S. Consequently, it\u2019s reasonable to anticipate a prolonged surge in advertiser adoption as Alphabet progressively introduces its AI solutions worldwide.\nGoogle Cloud also contributed significantly to Alphebet\u2019s revenue growth. However, it also had a notable contribution to the company\u2019s profitability, with the division undergoing a significant margin expansion.\nIn particular, not only did Google Cloud revenues grow by a notable 28% to $9.6 billion, but the division\u2019s operating margin expanded from 2.6% last year to 9.4%. It\u2019s very encouraging to see that Q1 was Google Cloud\u2019s fifth consecutive quarter with a positive operating profit margin.\nIn fact, a margin expansion in Google Cloud has taken place every quarter during this five-quarter period, notably boosting Alphebet\u2019s overall margins and EPS growth. To illustrate, in Q1, the company\u2019s operating margin jumped to 32%, up from 25% in the previous year, which, combined with growing revenues and share repurchases, resulted in EPS skyrocketing from 62% to $1.89.\nFollowing such a strong Q1 report, Alphabet shares soared to a new all-time high. Yet, I continue to find the stock quite attractively priced compared to its future growth prospects. Following an excellent start to the year, consensus estimates for Alphabet\u2019s full-year EPS stand at $7.51, which implies a year-over-year increase of nearly 30%. Note that this comes after FY2023\u2019s EPS growth of 27.3%. Despite such lavish growth figures, shares trade close to 22.2x this year\u2019s projected EPS.\nEven if Alphabet\u2019s growth were to slow considerably from its current levels, the stock\u2019s valuation still looks rather cheap, especially given Alphabet\u2019s moat and leading position in the AI race. It\u2019s also possible that Wall Street underestimates Alphabet\u2019s growth growth prospects, which could imply that shares are even cheaper than they actually appear. Given the powerful combination of revenue growth and a strong margin expansion in Google Cloud, this is not a far-fetched assumption.\nLooking at Wall Street\u2019s view on the stock, Alphabet features a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 31 Buys and seven Holds assigned in the past three months. At $189.79, the average\u00a0Alphabet stock price prediction implies 12.9%\u00a0upside potential.\nIf you\u2019re unsure which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell GOOGL stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0Mark Kelley\u00a0from Stifel Nicolaus, featuring an average return of 32.12% per rating and a 95% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\nTo sum up, Alphabet\u2019s stellar Q1 results further strengthened my conviction in the tech giant\u2019s prospects. With robust revenue growth driven by AI-powered advertising solutions and significant margin expansion in Google Cloud, Alphabet continues to surpass market expectations.\nIn fact, with the market likely still not fully pricing in the added benefit of AI to the company\u2019s results, I believe the stock price remains at rather compelling levels despite the double-digit post-earnings rally. Hence, I will keep adding to my position at current levels.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "Forget the New Dividend. Here's Why I'm Buying Alphabet Stock.",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) became the latest tech company to announce a dividend. For shareholders on record June 10, Alphabet will pay a $0.20-per-share dividend, which is around a 0.5% yield when that dividend is annualized.\nWhile some investors are thrilled about this announcement, it's a moot point for me. Instead, I'm looking at how strong Alphabet's business looked in Q1 and realizing that Alphabet is still a growth stock to be reckoned with.\nAt face value, Alphabet's Q1 was awesome. Revenue rose 15% year over year to $80.5 billion, and earnings per share (EPS) rose 62% to $1.89. But when you break it down, there were some even more impressive results hidden within those figures.\nAlthough many investors are focusing on Alphabet's artificial intelligence (AI) products, it's still an advertising business at its core. Nearly 77% of its revenue came from advertising-related sources in Q1, and this revenue comes from sector-leading businesses like the Google search engine and YouTube.\nCompared to Google, YouTube is in its infancy. But its popularity allows it to draw in top advertising dollars. In the U.S., YouTube is actually the most popular video platform besides linear TV. As a result, it draws a lot of eyeballs and thus establishes its status as a top place to advertise. This is likely why YouTube had a phenomenal quarter, with revenue up 21%.\nAnother area that's thriving is Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices. This includes divisions like its YouTube TV service, NFL Sunday Ticket, revenue from Google Play, and Pixel phones. Revenue rose 18%, showing consumers still want to spend on nonessential items.\nLastly, Google Cloud crushed it in Q1. This division focuses on Alphabet's cloud computing business, which is vital for customers who need to increase their computing capacity but don't want to invest in the systems themselves. Cloud computing has become incredibly popular with the rise of AI workloads, as businesses can't justify the cost of thousands of GPUs to run their models for a short time. So they rent some computing power from cloud computing providers like Google Cloud.\nGoogle Cloud is a popular choice for AI workloads, as it has already captured 90% of generative AI unicorns (private companies worth at least $1 billion). This popularity has spread into other industries, which is why Google Cloud's revenue rose 29% in Q1. It's also becoming far more profitable, as it posted an operating margin of 9% instead of 3% last year.\nAlphabet's business is truly firing on all cylinders, so the stock jumped nearly 10% the day following earnings. But I still think investors can get in on this incredible business, as it's just getting started.\nAfter the jump, Alphabet now trades for 21.8 times forward earnings.\nCompared to the much broader S&P 500, which trades at 20.8 times forward earnings, it doesn't command much of a premium to the broader market. This gives me confidence that investors can buy the stock now and not worry about overpaying for Alphabet.\nFurthermore, the stock would trade well below its five-year average valuation if Alphabet hits analyst guidance. If it hits its earnings targets plus returns to its average trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 26, that means the stock would have a 22% upside over the next 12 months. That's a solid investment and one I'll gladly partake in.\nBeyond one year, I see plenty of trends in Alphabet's favor, as it has emerged as an AI leader after stumbling out of the blocks. Because of that, I think right now is an excellent buying opportunity for Alphabet's stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nAlphabet (GOOGL) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this internet search leader is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 23.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 30.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 29.7%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Alphabet is 16.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -19.4%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.5%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Alphabet have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 11.8% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Alphabet a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Alphabet is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Sheraden Frances ",
        "Text": "Tech conglomerate Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is set to ride a wave of positive momentum, both in the long and short term.\nIn the long term, the significant growth and profitability of the Cloud segment shows promising signs to catch up to larger rivals, along with the company's leading position in search allowing it to capitalize on new developments from the investments made into generative artificial intelligence.\nIn the short term, a series of potential catalysts include the upcoming company events to showcase AI capabilities (Google I/O), potential for Gemini image relaunch that could help with sentiment on Google's AI capabilities, the revenue potential from Shorts monetization and the ongoing operating model optimization and reprioritization.\nThis analysis will delve into the long-term and short-term catalysts that could potentially fuel Alphabet's momentum, as well as my forward views on these factors. But first and foremost, let's dive into the company's outstanding performance recorded in the first quarter of 2024.\nRevenue overview\nSource: Alphabet investor relations\nIn the first quarter, Alphabet significantly exceeded expectations, surpassing consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings. According to Factset data, the company exceeded revenue estimates by approximately $1 billion. The company achieved $80.50 billion in sales, representing a significant 15.40% year-over-year increase. The figure above illustrates this revenue growth was driven by notable advancements in YouTube ads (up 20.90% year over year), Google Search (up 14.40%) and Google Cloud (up 28.40%).\nAdditionally, Alphabet outperformed consensus expectations in terms of profitability, with an operating margin of 31.60% (a 667 basis point increase from a year ago). More notably, its Google cloud operating margins took a wild upturn delivering a margin of 9.40% (up 683 basis points). The company's operating income for the quarter amounted to $25.50 billion, reflecting a substantial 32% increase compared to the same period in 2023. On that note, the expansion in profitability can be attributed to better operating leverage as the higher top line was met with flattish operating costs. Alphabet's earnings per share performance showed remarkable growth as it reported a substantial rise in net income to $23.70 billion (up 57.20%), equating to $1.89 (versus $1.17 last year) diluted net income per share surpassing consensus estimates by a wide margin.\nNet income overview\nSource: Alphabet investor relations\nA key upside of owning Alphabet lies in its ability to provide significant returns to shareholders through its substantial available free cash flow. In the first quarter alone, it generated free cash flow of $16.80 billion (down 2.20% year over year). Capitalizing on this substantial free cash flow, the management made a historic announcement of a 20 cents cash dividend, scheduled to be paid on June 17. Moreover, the cash dividend is in addition to Alphabet's declaration of a $70 billion share repurchase program, which will further contribute to returning substantial amounts of cash to shareholders. Even before this announcement, Alphabet had been returning capital to its shareholder evident from its repurchase of $15.70 billion worth of its own shares in the first quarter of 2024 alone resulting in an impressive 93% cash flow return percentage.\nIn light of the introduction of both the dividend and share repurchase programs, I expect Alphabet to attract a growing number of investors, consequently driving its value upward in the medium to long term.\nKnown for its pioneering search engine, Alphabet has evolved into a multi-faceted entity encompassing a vast array of products and services spanning from cloud computing and advertising to hardware and artificial intelligence. Amidst this dynamic landscape, the company has shown an excellent trajectory of growth and innovation (evident by its exceptional revenue growth record [compound annual growth rate of 18.50% from 2017 to 2023]). With this, Alphabet derives a lion's share of its revenue from its advertising segment, but with the increasing share of the cloud segment in Google's revenue, it is bringing some much-needed diversity to the revenue mix.\nRevenue mix 2017 versus 2023\nSource: Alphabet investor relations\nAlthough the Google Cloud segment is consistently increasing its revenue share (Cloud revenues has grown at a CAGR of 41.90% from 2017 to 2023) while also being consistently profitable, it still lags behind larger rivals. According to CRN.com, Google Cloud generated almost three times less than Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud businesses. But this segment is showing significant promise, with it now being consistently profitable and continuing to grow at a very healthy rate (recorded positive operation margin in 2023 of 5.20% [9.4% in first-quarter 2024]), but is still low compared to Amazon at 26% and Microsoft at 44%. As the segment expands in the long term, Google Cloud's operating margin is to improve as well. However, I also expect Alphabet will continue to make significant investments to capitalize on the growth opportunities arising from the shift toward cloud-based solutions. Consequently, the margins are expected to remain below those of competitors like Amazon and Microsoft, despite steady improvements.\nGoogle Cloud business operating performance (2018 to 2023)\nSource: Alphabet investor relations\nGiven the widespread shift to cloud-based solutions, I am optimistic about the market's size and rapid growth, enabling all three players (Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet) to achieve success over the next few years. Google, with its strategic dedication, technological expertise and financial capabilities, is well positioned to continue gaining market share. Nonetheless, capitalizing on the growing market will involve substantial investment, potentially causing Google Cloud's profitability to lag behind that of its peers.\nCloud Infrastructure market share as of fourth-quarter 2023\nSource: Statista\nThe generative AI space as a whole has immense potential for revolutionizing various industries from entertainment to health care and beyond with its applications being vast and continually expanding. However, several concerns have been raised with regard to the potential impact on Alphabet's leading position in search with the latest developments in the space by competitors like Microsoft (OpenAI), as gen AI technologies usher in the development of more sophisticated and interactive consumer tools, potentially challenging its standing. However, I believe Alphabet's strong position in both the gen AI and search spaces will be unchanged due to the promising development of products.\nAlphabet has continued to dedicate significant resources to its investments in gen AI and has done so for several years. I expect its abilities to expand as it continues to invest heavily over the next few years as well. Alphabet has its own products, like Bard, that I expect to evolve and improve due to ongoing investments that will allow the company to maintain its strong position in search and the broader digital advertising market.\nI believe Google is way ahead in the AI race with its leading position stemming from three main factors. First, its extensive volume of research is unparalleled, with 183 papers accepted in 2023 alone, nearly three times more than its closest competitor. Second, Google possesses unparalleled access to vast amounts of data thanks to its 16 services boasting over half a billion daily active users. Finally, Google's robust infrastructure enables it to effectively train and deploy AI models to a wide audience, leveraging its immense reach.\nRecently, Alphabet's Gemini Pro 1.5 its most advanced large language model was released to the general public, with a free tier limited to 50 requests a day. The Gemini Pro 1.5 is a multimodal system meaning it is able to process image, audio and video inputs, in addition to text inputs (OpenAI's latest version of GPT-4 is currently only able to process text and image inputs).\nApart from the aforementioned long-term catalysts, my optimistic outlook on the company in the short term is derived from several other catalysts, including:\nGoogle I/O Event Scheduled for May 14, this annual event is anticipated to introduce new AI integrations across various Google products such as Search, Maps, Android, Cloud and Google Workspace.\nGemini image generation relaunch Expected to relaunch in the second quarter, Google is set to introduce an upgraded version of Gemini image generation. This relaunch may involve a gradual rollout, initially granting access to developers or beta testers for human oversight and feedback. The focus may initially target specific use cases like generating product mockups and illustrations for advertisers, which may boost investor sentiment on Gemini.\nShorts monetization and YouTube revenue Short-form videos are driving engagement and revenue growth on social media platforms, including YouTube. As Shorts monetization catches up in 2024, we anticipate accelerating revenue growth on YouTube, which could positively impact Alphabet's overall revenue growth trajectory.\nOperating model optimization and reprioritization- Over the past few years, management has placed significant emphasis on the development of innovative new features, all while maintaining a firm grip on cost control. This strategic approach clearly indicates management's strong commitment to achieving a more sustainable operating model that will enhance profitability. Recently, Alphabet has outlined its plans to improve expense efficiency by 2024, which may involve restructuring efforts aimed at reducing both headcount and operational expenses, thereby driving margin expansion. An internal memo from Alphabet's CEO has also informed employees to anticipate further layoffs in 2024, following the previous layoffs in the ad sales unit. These actions underscore the company's ongoing efforts to reassess priorities and invest in its most critical areas.\nUsing a discounted cash flow model to assess Alphabet's value over a five-year growth period, a fair price of around $188 per share is projected, representing a roughly 10% increase from current levels on the basis cash flows are anticipated to grow from a forecasted $70 billion in 2024 to $130.50 billion by 2028, with a compounded annual growth rate of 13.30%. These estimates seem plausible given the positive growth drivers identified previously, suggesting potential upside in the company's growth trajectory. As Alphabet solidifies its core businesses and continues to innovate with AI tools to reinforce its position in search, there is room for significant upside beyond investor expectations. Extending the growth horizon to 10 years, a fair value of approximately $241 per share is projected, marking a roughly 40% increase from current levels, further highlighting Alphabet's growth potential.\nDespite various bearish arguments against Alphabet, there are no evident flaws or indications of these concerns in its financials. Throughout its history, the company has been a driving force of innovation and now, as a formidable and influential entity, it can innovate on a grander scale with substantial upfront investments while also generously rewarding shareholders. While many large tech companies appear to be thriving presently, the crucial aspect is their trajectory over the next five to 10 years. Given Google's immense scale, I am confident it will only continue to ascend from its current position.\nDiscounted cash flow analysis five-year growth exit\nSource: valueinvesting.io\nIn conclusion, Alphabet stands poised to capitalize on a multitude of catalysts both in the long and short term. The company's robust growth trajectory in the cloud segment, coupled with its pioneering advancements in generative AI, positions it favorably to maintain and expand its market dominance. Short-term catalysts, including upcoming events showcasing AI capabilities and product relaunches, add further momentum to Alphabet's growth story. With a strategic focus on operational efficiency and innovation, Alphabet is primed to deliver significant upside potential for investors in the foreseeable future.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Earnings season is in full swing, with countless stocks on the move. As is often the case, there's been a lot of fluctuation in the tech market. Easing inflation and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have made investors bullish on the companies profiting most from these developments. In fact, the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector has risen 50% in the last 12 months.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) have delivered some of the biggest gains, with their shares up 55% and 32% over the last 12 months. These companies host some of the most widely used online services, and likely have bright futures in the budding AI market over the next decade.\nAlphabet and Microsoft will likely prove to be assets to any portfolio over the long term, and are worth considering right now before it's too late. So let's look closer at Alphabet and Microsoft's businesses and determine which is the better stock to invest in tech.\nAlphabet released its earnings for the first quarter of 2024 on April 25, posting revenue growth of 15% year over year to $81 billion. The company beat sales forecasts by $2 billion. Meanwhile, earnings per share estimates hit $1.89, outperforming Wall Street projections by $0.38.\nGlowing quarterly results saw Alphabet's share price spike 14% in extended trading on April 25. The quarter illustrated the potency of Alphabet's business, with solid growth in its advertising business and signs that its investment in AI is beginning to pay off.\nDuring the quarter, Google advertising sales jumped 14% year over year, while its AI-focused Google Cloud segment posted growth of 28%.\nUser-rich platforms like YouTube, Android, Chrome, and the many services under Google have seen Alphabet become an advertising powerhouse, and now it looks like these services could help the company take on a crucial role in AI.\nThe AI market is projected to hit a valuation nearing $2 trillion in 2023, up from just under $200 billion last year. Meanwhile, Alpahbet's leading role in tech and $69 billion in free cash flow suggests it has the financial resources and brand power to flourish in the sector in the coming years.\nMicrosoft also posted earnings on April 25, revealing results for its Q2 2024 (ending March 2024). Like Alphabet, Microsoft delivered glowing results. During the quarter, revenue increased by 18% year over year to $62 billion, outperforming expectations by $1 billion.\nThe Windows company enjoyed gains in multiple segments, with its productivity and business processes division posting a 12% year-over-year rise in sales and Intelligent Cloud revenue popping 21%. Additionally, personal computing sales increased by 17% year over year, reflecting continued improvements in the PC market and signs that its acquisition of game developer Activision Blizzard last year is paying off.\nAs the home of brands like Windows, Office, Azure, Xbox, and LinkedIn, Microsoft's reach in tech is vast. The company holds leading positions in multiple markets, making its stock one of the best ways to invest in the industry.\nIn fact, Microsoft holds the second-largest market share in the cloud market (after only Amazon Web Services) and is gradually edging closer to the top spot. Microsoft's partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI and expanding role in cloud computing have made it one of the biggest threats in AI, supported by impressive growth in its cloud segment in Q2 2024.\nThe choice between investing in Alphabet or Microsoft is not easy. Their stocks have delivered stellar growth over the last five years, with Alphabet's rising 164% and Microsoft's 209%. Meanwhile, both companies are coming out of impressive quarters, outperforming forecasts on multiple fronts. Even their free cash flows are in similar positions, with Alphabet's at $69 billion and Microsoft's at $70 billion.\nConsequently, it's worth comparing the value of their stocks to determine which is the better buy right now.\nThis chart compares Alphabet and Microsoft using three key valuation metrics, and the Google company appears to win on all three fronts. For each of these metrics, the lower the figure, the better the value. As a result, Alphabet's lower forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, price-to-free cash flow, and price-to-sales ratio indicate that Alphabet shares are the better bargain.\nAlongside its lucrative digital advertising business and expanding position in AI, Alphabet is a tech stock worth buying over Microsoft this month. However, it's still worth keeping Microsoft on your radar to strike when the time is right.\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s take a look at Alphabet\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n Check out our latest analysis for Alphabet \nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 19% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Alphabet today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $216.27, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Alphabet\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Alphabet's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 49%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in GOOGL\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on GOOGL, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nDiving deeper into the forecasts for Alphabet mentioned earlier will help you understand how analysts view the stock going forward.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Alphabet fair value estimate is US$216\nAlphabet's US$178 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate\n The US$191 analyst price target for GOOGL is 12% less than our estimate of fair value\nToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n View our latest analysis for Alphabet \nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$80.4b\nUS$92.1b\nUS$107.0b\nUS$114.0b\nUS$129.5b\nUS$140.2b\nUS$149.3b\nUS$157.1b\nUS$164.0b\nUS$170.2b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x17\nAnalyst x18\nAnalyst x10\nAnalyst x3\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 8.25%\nEst @ 6.49%\nEst @ 5.26%\nEst @ 4.39%\nEst @ 3.79%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% \nUS$75.0k\nUS$80.2k\nUS$86.8k\nUS$86.3k\nUS$91.5k\nUS$92.4k\nUS$91.8k\nUS$90.1k\nUS$87.8k\nUS$85.0k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$867b\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$170b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.2%\u2013 2.4%) = US$3.6t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.6t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$1.8t\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$2.7t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$178, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alphabet as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.046. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "Author": "  Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Online services giant Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has made plenty of millionaires over the years. You'd have more than a million dollars in the Google parent's stock today if you invested just $15,000 when it entered the public stock market in 2004. If you put the same cash to work in a broad market tracker like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT: SPY) instead, you'd have a total return of just $105,000:\nBut you can build a million-dollar portfolio without market-crushing stars. Take the index tracker's compound average returns of 10.3% over that 20-year period, commit to making a modest investment every month, and let it run for a few more years.\nFor example, imagine setting up an automatic investment of $100 per month at the age of 20. There's no seed money to start that portfolio, no contribution increases over time, and you're sticking with that S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index tracker, automatically reinvesting its dividends in more shares of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) along the way.\n$100 a month isn't nothing, but the commitment is arguably small enough to work for most people with a day job. 44 years later, at the reasonable retirement age of 64, you will have invested a grand total of $52,800 in a simple index ETF. And thanks to the magic of compound returns, you'd have about $1.07 million in your retirement account.\nMany diversified mutual funds or ETFs can handle a long-term investment like the example above. Set it, forget it, and laugh all the way to the bank after a few decades.\nBut very few single stocks can carry that load. Oceans rise, empires fall, and even the most robust giants aren't immune to unexpected downturns, shifting consumer tastes, and technological progress. Let's check out a couple of examples.\nAt the turn of the millennium, General Electric (NYSE: GE) boasted the second-largest market cap of all at $508 billion. By now, the industrial empire has split into three separate companies whose market caps add up to about half of the January 2000 footprint.\nEnron or Lehman Brothers are more dramatic examples of crumbling empires, and the list is long. Among the 1,925 stocks in the Russell 2000 index, only 640 have a stock market history of at least 25 years.\nOnce, I bought a couch with a lifetime warranty from what had once been the largest department store of all. Six months and a bad holiday season later, Montgomery Ward filed for bankruptcy and liquidated the whole business. the company couldn't handle the one-two punch of big-box retailers and the early years of online shopping. So much for lifetime warranties.\nIn light of these examples, it's clear that very few companies can be expected to thrive over several decades. However, there are exceptions to the rule -- and I believe Alphabet is one of those rare survivors.\nBuilt to thrive in a variety of economic environments thanks to the ultra-flexible Alphabet umbrella organization, Alphabet has the ability to expand and explore in many different industries. If the online search and advertising revenues dry up, Alphabet would rely on the Android smartphone, YouTube video platform, and Google Cloud decentralized computing service in the short term. Meanwhile, promising side gigs like the Waymo self-driving taxi service, Calico medical research group, or Verily health data unit could pick up the long-term baton. Or maybe Google Cloud will just run with it instead, powered by its artificial intelligence expertise.\nAlphabet's portfolio of potential business stars will change over time, and I probably haven't even seen their best ideas yet. And that's exactly why I think the company is ready to run for decades to come. I don't recommend putting your entire nest egg in one basket, unless that basket holds a diversified fund -- but if you absolutely have to do it, Alphabet's stock is at the top of my candidates list.\nA flexible business model and proven success in building strong technology solutions position Alphabet to match or even exceed the S&P 500's long-term returns. And if the stock can indeed outperform the average S&P 500 returns in the long run, you'll reach your million-dollar retirement goal even faster.\nAnd a small boost to the return rate would make a big difference in 44 years -- beating the Street's average returns by a single percentage point gives you a $1.5 million portfolio in the end:\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Alphabet wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Is Trending Stock Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) a Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this company have returned +7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 6.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.87 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +29.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +11.3%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.66 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +32.1%. This estimate has changed +13.1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.73 indicates a change of +13.9% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +12.5%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $70.48 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $290.84 billion and $324.4 billion estimates indicate +13.4% and +11.5% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Should You Be Adding Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) To Your Watchlist Today?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.\n View our latest analysis for Alphabet \nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that Alphabet has managed to grow EPS by 21% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Alphabet shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 25% to 30%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\nThe chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.\nYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Alphabet's future profits.\nOwing to the size of Alphabet, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$215b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.\nWhile it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. A brief analysis of the CEO compensation suggests they are. Our analysis has discovered that the median total compensation for the CEOs of companies like Alphabet, with market caps over US$8.0b, is about US$14m.\nAlphabet offered total compensation worth US$8.8m to its CEO in the year to December 2023. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.\nIf you believe that share price follows earnings per share you should definitely be delving further into Alphabet's strong EPS growth. If that's not enough, consider also that the CEO pay is quite reasonable, and insiders are well-invested alongside other shareholders. Everyone has their own preferences when it comes to investing but it definitely makes Alphabet look rather interesting indeed. Of course, identifying quality businesses is only half the battle; investors need to know whether the stock is undervalued. So you might want to consider this free discounted cashflow valuation of Alphabet.\nAlthough Alphabet certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see companies with insider buying, then check out this handpicked selection of companies that not only boast of strong growth but have also seen recent insider buying..\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

Alphabet also emphasized that it is well-positioned for the next wave of artificial intelligence through its platform Gemini which is a generative AI multimodal with understanding across audio, video, and text code.\nThis has now led to a +17% year-to-date surge in Alphabet\u2019s stock which has impressively topped the S&P 500\u2019s +8% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +4%. Furthermore, GOOGL has noticeably outperformed the broader indexes over the last year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSoaring EPS Estimates\nEarnings estimates for Alphabet\u2019s fiscal 2024 and FY25 have soared in the last week after the tech giant reported Q1 earnings of $1.89 per share which increased 61% year over year and crushed the Zacks Consensus of $1.49 a share by 27%.\nLargely attributing to Alphabet\u2019s strong buy rating is that FY24 earnings estimate revisions have risen 10% since the company\u2019s exhilarating Q1 report from estimates of $6.79 a share to $7.49 per share. Plus, FY25 EPS estimates are up 10% in that last week as well, rising from projections of $7.78 a share to $8.61 per share.\nAlphabet\u2019s annual earnings are now projected to rise 29% this year with another 15% EPS growth expected in FY25.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMagnificent Seven Value\nAdding value to shareholders and peaking their optimism, Alphabet announced a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share with the first payout set for June 17 to shareholders on record as of June 10. Notably, five of the Magnificent Seven stocks now offer dividends with Alphabet joining Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, Nvidia NVDA, and Meta Platforms META\u00a0in this regard. \u00a0\nHowever, what also stands out about Alphabet is that outside of Meta Platforms, it is the most reasonably valued of the Mag Seven in terms of P/E valuation at 24.3X forward earnings and close to the S&P 500\u2019s 21.5X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nAlphabet continues to rightfully retain its title as a \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stock that has significantly boosted the market\u2019s returns in recent years and is one the most appealing technology-driven companies to invest in at the moment.\u00a0\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google recently added a generative AI-powered description feature to Google TV in a bid to boost the viewing experience for its users.The company will leverage its in-house generative AI model, Gemini, to generate auto descriptions for movies and TV shows, reducing viewers\u2019 search time.These AI-generated summaries will be curated to suit a viewer\u2019s personal preferences of a particular genre or actor, catering to their individual interests.The new feature will also allow Google TV to reach a wider audience by translating these summaries into their native languages.Alphabet is expected to gain solid traction across smart TV users on the back of its latest move. This, in turn, will further strengthen its position in the global smart streaming devices market, presenting a significant growth opportunity for the company. Per a Statista report, the global smart streaming devices market size is expected to witness a CAGR of 9.4% during the forecast period of 2024-2028.Moreover, strengthening Google TV capabilities is expected to aid the Google Services segment\u2019s performance, which has been a key growth driver for Alphabet. Its shares have rallied 23.5% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 17.8%.\nThe latest move will aid this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company to compete well against some notable industry players like Amazon AMZN and Roku ROKU, which are also making concerted efforts to leverage generative AI capabilities to gain a solid footing in the streaming devices market.You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Amazon introduced generative AI updates for its Fire TV voice search, allowing users to ask more nuanced and open-ended questions about TV shows and movies.This generative AI feature allows users to ask complex queries to Alexa directly from their Fire TV or Alexa Remote, transforming requests into conversations rather than commands. It allows users to speak in a more natural and conversational way, allowing them to discover new content more effectively.Roku, on the other hand, announced its plans to introduce Roku Smart Picture, a set of generative AI-powered features that uses machine learning and content partner data to automatically adjust the viewing experience of all Roku TV models.\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\nThe latest move is in sync with Alphabet\u2019s increasing efforts to integrate generative AI capabilities into its products and services.Recently, the company unveiled LearnLM, a family of generative AI models designed for conversational tutoring on various subjects. The platform enables teachers to discover new ideas, content and activities and tailor materials to student needs. It powers Circle to Search on Android, solving basic math and physics problems, and underpins YouTube's clarifying question and quiz feature.Alphabet also introduced new additions to its Gemma family of open models, including Gemma 2, the next generation with a 27 billion parameter model, and PaliGemma, the first vision language model for image captioning, labeling, and Q&A use cases.All the above-mentioned endeavors will enable the company to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the booming generative AI market. Per a Fortune Business Insights report, the global generative AI market size is expected to hit $67.2 billion in 2024 and reach $967.7 by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 39.6% between 2024 and 2032.Solidifying prospects in the booming generative AI market are expected to aid its overall financial performance in the days ahead.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $295.12 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.1%.Moreover, growing gen AI efforts will help the company fend off competitors like Microsoft MSFT, which is also making increasing efforts to boost its generative AI capabilities.Recently, Microsoft introduced new generative AI and data solutions for retailers, enabling personalized shopping experiences, empowering store associates, and unifying retail data. These include Azure OpenAI Service copilot templates, retail data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights copilot features, and Retail Media Creative Studio.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Cohen, who also owns The New York Mets, founded SAC Capital back in 1992, and since then through 2009 lost money only once. A Bloomberg report earlier this year said that Point72 Asset Management has been able to raise so much cash recently that it's starting to decline external money. The fund has reportedly raised about about $12.8 billion since 2020.\nPoint72's main fund returned about 11% in 2023, and 12% in the previous year.\nBillionaire Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management runs a highly diversified portfolio. As of the end of the March quarter, the portfolio's net worth was over $41.2 billion, with tech stocks accounting for 17% of the total portfolio.\nUnlike long-term value investors like Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman, Cohen moves with speed and adapts quickly. He's been like this for decades. When he was in Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, he would often skip classes to watch stock movements at a local brokerage. He took pride in predicting stock movements based on their direction.\nCohen, worth over $19 billion, is yet again adapting to the quickly changing global financial landscape as investors demand steady returns. Earlier this year, it was reported that Cohen and his team is expanding macro teams at Point72 as the global economy resets to the new era of high interest rates. The report said that the fund would establish as many as 51 macro trading teams.\nSteve Cohen's Q1'2024 Stake: $258,046,983\nAlphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG) has become a top horse in the AI race, albeit with reactive approach, as Alphabet Inc.

        "Text": "Successful investing is all about building the right portfolio, populating it with stocks that will generate solid returns over the long run. Sounds simple, right? The only \u2018trick\u2019 is finding stocks that fit that profile, and the key is right in front of us, waiting in the raw data of the stock market.\nTherein lies the rub. The markets toss up a huge volume of information, based on thousands of traders dealing in thousands of stocks \u2013 the result is millions of transactions every day, and it\u2019s the work of a lifetime to make sense of it all. Even Wall Street\u2019s best analysts will usually focus on a segment of the whole.\nThis is where the TipRanks Smart Score comes in. It\u2019s a data sorting and collating tool, based on a combination of AI and natural language processing, designed to gather all the data on any given stock and then compare that stock\u2019s performance to a set of factors known as accurate predictors of future outperformance. The stock\u2019s comparison results are then distilled into a single score, on a scale of 1 to 10. A stock that rings in at a \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 is one that has definitely earned additional investor interest.\nThat\u2019s especially true when market-leading companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) are picking up the \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 Scores. We\u2019ve used the TipRanks database to look up the bigger picture on both; these top-scoring stocks also bring Strong Buy ratings and double-digit upside potentials to the table. Here are the details.\nAlphabet\nFirst up, a giant of the tech world. Best known as the parent company of both Google and YouTube \u2013 Alphabet is the leader in the world of online search and holds a dominant position in online advertising and video content distribution. The company recently became just the fourth Wall Street firm to surpass $2 trillion in market cap, and is one of just six publicly traded companies with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion. Currently, Alphabet is valued at $2.17 trillion.\nGiven its overall strong position in tech, Alphabet is at the forefront of development in the AI field, and is applying generative AI to its Google search engine, and to its Google Cloud subscription service. Alphabet even has an autonomous driving division, Waymo, that has put AI-based self-driving vehicles on the streets of San Francisco.\nAt the financial bottom line, Alphabet\u2019s earnings have been on an upward trajectory for the past year. In the company\u2019s most recent earnings report, covering 1Q24, Alphabet reported $1.89 in EPS, up from $1.17 in the prior year and 38 cents per share better than had been anticipated. The company\u2019s revenues, which totaled $80.54 billion and beat the forecast by $1.84 billion, were powered by advertising revenue. Ad revenue for the quarter came to $61.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year.\nAll of this \u2013 the solid business model, the tech leadership, and the strong finances \u2013 have caught the attention of Tigress analyst Ivan Feinseth, who writes of Alphabet, \u201cSearch and Advertising revenue will continue to see accelerating growth, and the ongoing integration of AI functionality will continue to drive its leadership position across all key technology trends and business lines. GOOGL continues to benefit from strong advertising revenue and user engagement, driving another quarter of strong results across all key business lines, including Cloud, which continues to benefit from increasing AI integration.\u201d\nThe 5-star analyst goes on to give these shares a Buy rating with a $210 price target that points toward a one-year upside potential of 20%. (To watch Feinseth\u2019s track record, click here)\nLike most tech giants, Alphabet has picked up plenty of Wall Street recommendations \u2013 no fewer than 37, with 32 Buys and 5 Holds to back up the Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares in GOOGL are selling for $174.99 and the $197.53 average target price implies a gain of nearly 13% in the next 12 months. (See GOOGL stock forecast)\nAlibaba\nNext up is Alibaba, best known as the \u2018Amazon of China.\u2019 That\u2019s a bit unfair, really. Alibaba is a powerful online retail and services tech company in its own right. The company\u2019s founder is the near-legendary Chinese tech entrepreneur and innovator Jack Ma, and his creation is the absolute leader in China\u2019s domestic online retail market. The company has been in business since 1999, and has branched out beyond China\u2019s borders, and beyond ecommerce.\nThe company does offer a wide range of online retail services on the global market, and has moved into other tech sectors, including digital media, entertainment, and cloud computing. The company has several business segments, including innovation initiatives, but its chief business remains the Chinese Commerce segment.\nThat core business gives Alibaba a solid foundation to stand on. China has a population of approximately 1.4 billion, including approximately 800 million in its expanding urban regions. In its domestic market, Alibaba offers an unparalleled range of products and boasts that it can deliver anything to anywhere in China, with guaranteed next-day or 2-day delivery. The company\u2019s global online retail side features nearly 6,000 product categories and over 200,000 suppliers making more than 200 million products available in over 200 countries.\nAlibaba last reported financial results for fiscal 4Q24, which ended on March 31 of this year. The company\u2019s top line came to $30.73 billion, up 7% from the prior fiscal year Q4 and some $310 million over the estimates. The company\u2019s bottom line was reported as $1.40 by non-GAAP measures, missing the forecast by 2 cents per share.\nThis retail and tech company attracted a review from Benchmark analyst Fawne Jiang, who thinks BABA\u2019s strengths outweigh potential headwinds. Jiang writes, \u201cKey drivers for the next leg of the stock, in our view, are 1) sustainability of positive market share dynamics, 2) ecommerce monetization improvement driven by new ad product launch (slated in F2H25) to close the gap of CMR and GMV; and 3) reaccelerated cloud growth bolstered by AI cloud (F2H25). Uncertainty remains in light of 1) GMV growth largely depends on consumer sentiment (recently improving); 2) investment may create profitability volatility in the near Qs and FY25. Net net, we are incrementally more comfortable for a potential full-fledged turnaround playing out in F2H25 along with a stabilizing macro backdrop.\u201d\nFor Jiang, another of the Street\u2019s 5-star stock pros, these shares have earned a Buy rating, along with a $118 price target that suggests a 45% upside on the one-year horizon. (To watch Jiang\u2019s track record, click here)\nBABA\u2019s 17 recent stock reviews include 14 Buys to 3 Holds, for a Strong Buy consensus rating, and the average target price, of $103.46, implies an upside of 27% from the current share price of $81.26.

        "Title": "Better AI Stock: Amazon vs. Alphabet",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "As some of the world's most valuable companies, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) have long histories of providing investors with significant and consistent gains. Their shares are up 1,000% and 516% respectively over the past decade -- and the companies still have promising prospects as they expand their reach.\nThe shares look like particularly attractive options for anyone aiming to invest in artificial intelligence (AI). Demand for AI services has skyrocketed over the last year, with Amazon and Alphabet well-equipped to meet demand with their respective cloud platforms. These tech giants are investing heavily in the budding AI market, and could see significant gains as the sector develops.\nSo let's compare these companies' businesses and determine whether Amazon or Alphabet is the better AI stock right now.\nAmazon's stock price has popped 4% since April 30, when the company posted its earnings for the first quarter of 2024. During the period, revenue increased by 13% year over year to $43 billion, outperforming analysts' expectations by $750 million. Meanwhile, earnings per share estimates came in at $0.98 against forecasts of $0.83.\nThe promising results come after a range of cost-cutting measures and heavy investment in AI, which has put the company on a promising growth trajectory. Recent moves are paying off for the company, with Q1 2024 operating income soaring 221% to just under $15 billion.\nMuch of Amazon's profit growth is owed to its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has added several new AI tools since last year. Companies are increasingly turning to cloud services to integrate AI into their businesses. Meanwhile, AWS is the world's biggest cloud platform, accounting for 31% of the market.\nIn addition to cloud computing, Amazon has multiple ways to boost its business with AI. By improving its AI technology, the company can more accurately follow shopping trends and recommend products on its retail site, offer more efficient advertising on Prime Video, improve shipping logistics, and more.\nConsequently, it might be worth buying Amazon's stock while it is still at the beginning of its journey into AI.\nLike Amazon, Alphabet has a potent position in the tech sector that will likely strengthen further as it continues to expand its AI capabilities.\nThe Google parent's shares have risen 6% just since April 25, rallying investors with promising Q1 2024 earnings. The quarter saw Alphabet's revenue rise 15% year over year to $81 billion, outperforming Wall Street's expectations by $2 billion.\nOver the past year, investors have grown concerned that Alphabet has fallen behind rivals like Amazon and Microsoft in AI. However, its latest quarterly results seemed to temper those fears, as revenue from its AI-centered Google Cloud segment spiked 28% year over year. Meanwhile, its advertising sales rose 14%.\nThe stellar growth proved that Alphabet's venture into AI is paying off as it attracts new cloud clients and optimizes its digital advertising business. Alongside various budget cuts, Alphabet will likely continue to see consistent earnings and stock price gains in the coming years.\nAmazon and Alphabet seem to be at the top of their games after recent earnings releases, with both company's results proving that AI is a worthy venture. So the question is, which company's stock is more likely to deliver bigger gains over the long term and perhaps see a bigger return from AI?\nWith the AI industry still in its infancy, it's impossible to know the answers to these questions. In all likelihood, the best application for AI hasn't even been thought of yet, and it's impossible to know which company will profit most from the industry. As a result, it could be best to go with the company that currently has a stronger position in the sector and has gotten a better start, as market dominance is often challenging to take down once it is achieved.\nAnd with that, Amazon looks like the better and more reliable AI stock. The company's leading cloud market share has given it an advantage in AI. AWS has an impressive clientele, including top companies like Netflix, Sony, and Meta Platforms, and has made Amazon the go-to for AI cloud services.\nAdditionally, Amazon's price-to-sales ratio of 3 -- compared to Alphabet's 6 -- potentially makes Amazon's shares a better value.

        "Title": "Hedge Funds Just Picked Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) As The Top Quantum Computing Stock",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled the list of the 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy according to the hedge funds using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) stand against the other quantum computing stocks.\nThese days, artificial intelligence is one of the hottest topics on the stock market and the media. This is because of the improvements in data analysis and decision making offered by AI models. These have augmented pre AI data analysis and text production technologies, and consequently, Wall Street has piled billions of dollars into the industry.\nAs AI is to data science, quantum computing is to classical computing. Or at least in some aspects. The fundamental difference between a classical and quantum computer is physics. Classical computers operate under the principles of classic physics, which means that it is easy to determine whether a semiconductor's processor is in the on (1) or off (0) state. In quantum computing's case, a transistor's equivalent is an elemental particle capable of existing in multiple states. So, a quantum 'transistor' could be on and off at the same time, to provide programmers with more flexibility to solve problems.\nThis ability to process more inputs means that quantum computing offers complex problems that traditional computers might not have enough capacity for. This is one reason that some estimates expect the quantum computing industry to be worth a modest $11.4 billion by 2027 despite a rapid compounded annual growth rate of 33%.\nAt the same time, quantum computing stocks are riskier than even traditional and typically high growth companies. This is because their products do not have sizeable markets and require considerable investment and research and development expenditure which might even take longer to recover than for biotechnology stocks.\nThese facts also make it trickier to analyze quantum computing stock performance since there are considerably fewer publicly traded companies to offer the convenience of simply seeing how an exchange traded fund has performed. For instance, consider the holdings of the Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM). Some of its top holdings include software firm MicroStrategy and the memory manufacturer Micron. Neither of these companies generates material income from making products that are essential for a quantum computer to perform. Another major holding is NVIDIA, and while it does make a product for a quantum processing unit's (QPU) quantum controller, most, if not all of its share price gains have been due to artificial intelligence.\nThis means that we need to analyze individual quantum computing stocks to see how they have performed recently. Heading into the year's second half, investors have battled with high inflation, high interest rates, geopolitical tensions, turmoil in banking, and euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence since 2022.\nSome quantum computing stocks that are commonly known are Rigetti Computing, Inc. (NASDAQ:RGTI),\u00a0 IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ), and D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE:QBTS). Over the past five years, their shares have lost 89%, 24%, and 89%, respectively. Mind you though, this doesn't mean that quantum computing stocks never go up. For instance, take the example of IonQ. The firm listed its shares for trading in October after a merger, and between October 8th and November 19th, the stock soared by a whopping 233%. For comparison, Wall Street's AI darling NVIDIA's shares have gained 239% over the past twelve months.\nSo, the next question to ask is, what happened to this quantum computing stock? Well, part of the reason is a Goldman Sachs investment note that was released in November 2022. The note wondered when businesses would start adopting quantum computing into their operations, and whether the company's technology roadmap could align with this shift, as uncertainty persisted over \"which forms of quantum computer ultimately captures market share,\" according to analyst Toshiya Hari. After losing 14% in the wake of Hari's comments, the stock would proceed to bottom out over the new year in January, but its performance graph changes when we zoom into 2024's performance. April 2024 seems to have been the month for IonQ's shares as the stock is up by 17% since the 19th.\nLarry Page Our Methodology\nTo make our list of the best quantum computing stocks, we first made a list of pure play quantum computing companies and those that make crucial products for the industry.\u00a0 These stocks were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had held shares according to the last round of 13F filings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 222\nMega cap tech giant Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another key player in the global quantum computing market. Like IBM and Intel, it also designs its own quantum computing chips. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also seems to be interested in the practical side of quantum computing as it announced a $5 million prize in March 2024 for those who could think of the best use cases for the technology.\nAfter compiling hedge fund regulatory filings for Q1 2024, Insider Monkey found Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stakeholders. Rajiv Jain's Fisher Asset Management owned the largest stake which was worth $6.9 billion.\nAs a result, GOOGL ranks first among the 12 best quantum computing stocks to buy now.

        "Author": "  Lucas Shaw ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have held discussions with major Hollywood studios about licensing content for use in the tech giants\u2019 artificial intelligence video generation software, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWall Street Returns to T+1 Stock Trading After a Century\nWorld\u2019s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar\nNew BYD Hybrid Can Drive Non-Stop for More Than 2,000 Kilometers\n\u2018Not Gonna Be Pretty:\u2019 Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump\nTreasuries Hit as US Sales Struggle to Lure Buyers: Markets Wrap\nBoth companies are developing technology that can create realistic scenes from a text prompt, and have offered tens of millions of dollars to partner with studios in some capacity. Rival OpenAI, backed by Microsoft Corp., is having similar conversations. Alphabet, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment on the talks.\nHollywood studios are keen to discuss ways to use AI to reduce costs while also protecting themselves from having their work stolen. They are wary of giving films and TV shows to tech companies without control over how that content is used. Just this week, the actress Scarlett Johansson demanded OpenAI stop using a voice that sounded like her to power its chatbot after she refused to work with the company.\nBig money is at stake. On Wednesday, News Corp., parent of the Wall Street Journal and other media outlets, agreed to allow OpenAI to use content from more than a dozen of its publications in a deal that could be worth more than $250 million over five years.\nWarner Bros. Discovery Inc. has expressed a willingness to license some of its programs to train the models, but only for specific divisions \u2014 not its entire library. Walt Disney Co. and Netflix Inc. aren\u2019t willing to license their content to these companies, but have expressed an interest in other types of collaborations.\nHollywood studios are already using artificial intelligence in production, as are many filmmakers. Tyler Perry has used the technology to re-create the makeup he wears for his Madea character in movies. Director Robert Zemeckis has deployed artificial intelligence to de-age Tom Hanks in an upcoming film.\nBut a new crop of tools, including OpenAI\u2019s Sora and Alphabet\u2019s Veo, go a step further by promising to help filmmakers quickly create vivid, hyper-realistic clips based on just a few words of description. Their capabilities have elicited excitement and anxiety in Hollywood, where actors and writers staged a monthslong strike last year over concern about how AI could take their jobs.\nPerry, an actor, filmmaker and studio owner, was so amazed by a demonstration of Sora that he put plans for an $800 million studio expansion on hold earlier this year. He has been vocal about the opportunities AI represents for studios, but also in raising the alarm about the technology\u2019s impact on labor. He has called for the industry to rally together and formulate some sort of regulations. \u201cIf not, I just don\u2019t see how we survive,\u201d he told the Hollywood Reporter in February.\nThe music industry has adopted a tough stance against AI use. Universal Music Group NV sued Anthropic, a budding AI startup, for copying song lyrics and temporarily pulled its music from TikTok in part to secure protections for its artists. Sony Music Group sent letters to hundreds of partners this month warning them not to train any AI models on its music.\nNo major studio has so far sued a tech company over AI, despite fears that many of these models have already been trained on their copyrighted material. They would like to find a way to make AI work for them rather than fight a new technology that could help significantly reshape the industry. But studios have yet to agree to major commercial relationships around the use of AI with the largest technology companies.\nHollywood executives worry that licensing conversations will lead to tension between studios and their creative partners. For example, studios believe they have the rights to license a movie they own to an AI company. But if that company uses the movie to train its AI model on the face or voice of an actor in that movie, the actor would also want the opportunity to approve of it or not. A few actors have already struck deals with AI companies.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNew York\u2019s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point\nWhy Dave & Buster\u2019s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos\nElon Musk Still Has Friends in Silicon Valley\nWhen Business Is Just a Game\nThe Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Tech Giants Alphabet And Meta Pay Dividends Now - But Are They Worth It?",
        "Author": "  Aditi Ganguly ",
        "Text": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nTech behemoths are known for their stellar growth potential, which results in significant capital gains. However, they are typically not popular with investors seeking dividend payouts for steady passive income.\nNonetheless, in a significant move reflecting a shift in strategy and a maturing stage of growth, both Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have announced plans to pay dividends to their shareholders alongside massive share buyback programs.\nMeta Platforms, formerly Facebook, took the market by storm with its announcement of a quarterly dividend payment of $0.20 per share for the first time in its history back in February. The social media giant also revealed an expanded $50 billion share buyback program.\nThis decision came as Meta reported financials for the last quarter of 2023 exceeded expectations. Revenues amounted to $40.1 billion, surpassing the Wall Street estimate of $39.18 billion. Furthermore, the company's bottom line came in at $5.33, beating the consensus estimate of $4.96.\n\"Introducing a dividend just gives us a more balanced capital return program and some added flexibility in how we return capital in the future,\" said Susan Li, Meta Platforms CFO.\nSimilarly, Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, unveiled its plans to pay its first-ever dividend of $0.20 per share last month, alongside a massive $70 billion share buyback program. This decision followed Alphabet\u2019s impressive first-quarter results, which surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations.\nAlphabet's total revenues amounted to $80.54 billion in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, marking the fastest growth since 2022. EPS came in at $1.89, surpassing the consensus analyst estimate of $1.89.\nDividends signify a shift in the companies\u2019 approach, from solely focusing on growth to also prioritizing returning value to shareholders.\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These three reliable high-yield ETFs will put your income investments on autopilot.\nMiami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city with as little as $500 before that happens.\nMeta Platforms announced its first-quarter earnings results during the last week of April.\u00a0 However, the market reception of the tech giant's stellar growth was underwhelming. The company's revenues grew 27% year-over-year to $28.65 billion, marking the fastest quarterly growth since 2021.\nMeta's projected sales for the second quarter range between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. The midpoint of this range, at $37.75 billion, reflects an 18% year-over-year growth rate, falling short of analysts\u2019 average prediction of $38.3 billion.\nDuring the earnings call, Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted initiatives such as advancements in glasses and mixed reality, areas where the company currently lacks profitability. He also emphasized the escalating investments in artificial intelligence. However, this resulted in a steep sell-off, as META stock fell by 16% intraday on April 24.\nFor years, investors have been drawn to tech stocks like Meta and Alphabet for their growth potential. While dividends offer a steady income stream, they may not match the exponential growth that these companies have historically provided. Moreover, the tech stalwarts don't have a steady history of paying dividends, which might deter investors who seek reliable quarterly dividend payouts.\nWhile Meta and Alphabet\u2019s decision to pay dividends is a significant shift in their strategies, it\u2019s important to note that these payouts are unlikely to amount to substantial returns in the form of income for investors. Meta\u2019s forward dividend yield currently stands at a mere 0.11%, while Alphabet\u2019s is only slightly higher at 0.12%. These low yields indicate that both companies are still very much focused on growth rather than providing meaningful income to shareholders.\nFor investors who want to capture the growth potential of Meta and Alphabet while also generating steady income, diversifying their portfolios with real estate investments could be an attractive option.\nReal estate has historically been one of the most reliable sources of income for investors but is traditionally far from a passive investment when you consider all of the management responsibilities involved. However, a company backed by Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos has created a real estate investment platform that allows retail investors to buy shares of carefully selected rental properties. The best part is you can invest with as little as $100.\nArrived takes on all of the landlord responsibilities while investors simply collect monthly dividends from the rental income while the properties appreciate in value over time. The platform has already funded over 370 properties and has paid out more than $5.6 million in dividends. The process to sign up and become a partner in a single-family rental only takes about 10 minutes.\nClick here to view properties currently available on Arrived.\nDiversifying with private market real estate can help investors balance their portfolios, combining the growth potential of tech giants like Meta and Alphabet with the stability and income-generating capabilities of rental properties. This approach can provide a more well-rounded investment strategy, catering to both long-term growth and steady income generation.\nWant to explore more private market real estate options?

Elsewhere, the Dow saw a downswing of 1.06%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq depreciated by 0.58%.\nComing into today, shares of the company had gained 8.13% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 7.86%, while the S&P 500 gained 4.27%.\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Alphabet Inc. in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.87, showcasing a 29.86% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $70.55 billion, up 13.67% from the year-ago period.\nGOOG's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.70 per share and revenue of $291.26 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +32.76% and +13.55%, respectively.\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet Inc. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Alphabet Inc. is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\nIn terms of valuation, Alphabet Inc. is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 23.13. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 23.16.\nIt is also worth noting that GOOG currently has a PEG ratio of 1.32.

        "Title": "3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Alphabet (GOOG)",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 23.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 32.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 30%.\nCash Flow Growth\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Alphabet is 16.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -19.4%.\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.5%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Alphabet. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 13.1% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Alphabet a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Alphabet is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "This Stock Has Trounced Microsoft, Alphabet, and AMD. It Has Nothing to Do With AI.",
        "Author": "  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The big story in the stock market over the past few years has been artificial intelligence (AI). Generative AI, which can create text, images, videos, and audio, looks likely to be a transformative technology. Tech leaders like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Advanced Micro Devices are betting heavily on AI to drive growth.\nWhile the stocks of all three of those AI-centric companies have surged over the past year, they have been beaten handily by a stock that has absolutely nothing to do with AI. Investing is about more than chasing buzzwords. The tried-and-true method of finding unappreciated companies with solid growth prospects trading at pessimistic valuations still works.\nThis mystery stock has more than doubled over the past year, beating all three of the aforementioned tech companies by large margins. It has also trounced Microsoft, Alphabet, and AMD over the past three years, nearly tripling in that time.\nThe stock is Sprouts Farmers Market (NASDAQ: SFM), a small chain of grocery stores that does things differently from the major supermarket chains. That strategy has been paying off, and Sprouts still has plenty of growth ahead as it expands its footprint.\nSprouts operated 414 stores in 23 states as of March 31. Each store is relatively small. Its older stores are around 30,000 square feet, while its newer stores are even smaller at approximately 23,000 square feet. While the size of traditional supermarkets varies, they're often substantially larger.\nKeeping its stores small reduces the cost of building new stores, lowers the ongoing operating costs, and allows Sprouts to build in locations where larger supermarkets wouldn't make sense. The average new store costs just $3.8 million. First-year sales average $13 million, with 20% to 25% annual growth over the following four years.\nSprouts focuses on two things: produce and attribute-based items. Each store features a large produce section with affordable prices. It makes a point to beat competitors on price.\nAbout 70% of the products Sprouts sells are attribute-based -- meaning gluten-free, organic, vegan, non-GMO, and the like. It doesn't try to compete with the big supermarket chains on selection, instead curating a differentiated assortment of products. This works well with the company's customer base, which skews toward the wealthy and college-educated.\nThe Sprouts model is working. Comparable-store sales (comps) were up 4% in the first quarter of this year, and the company expects 3% to 4% comps growth for the full year. Adjusted earnings per share will top $3 this year, according to the company's guidance, up from just $1.25 in 2019.\nSprouts will open 35 new stores this year. In 2025 and beyond, the company plans to increase its store count by about 10% annually. It sees opportunities to open more than 300 new stores in its expansion markets, which include Texas, California, Florida, and portions of the East Coast.\nBased on the company's guidance, the stock trades for about 25 times forward earnings even after the multiyear rally that has propelled shares to market-trouncing gains. With the company expecting 10% store growth, low single-digit comps growth, and stable profit margins, double-digit annual earnings growth is in the cards.\nThat valuation looks reasonable given the chain's growth potential. It could also be an acquisition target. Amazon snagged Whole Foods, another differentiated grocery chain, in 2017. Sprouts could be an attractive acquisition for a larger chain hunting for growth.\nThe grocery industry is tough, and consumer behavior can shift unexpectedly. Sprouts is navigating the post-pandemic environment well so far, and the company looks poised to greatly expand its footprint in the coming years. While the stock might not repeat its performance from the past few years, it looks like a solid long-term investment.\nBefore you buy stock in Sprouts Farmers Market, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Sprouts Farmers Market wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-05-13, Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $204.91. It's currently trading at a price of $168.65. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 17.7%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Alphabet Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$6.56\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.49%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 21.80% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n113.19\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n118.01\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n204.91\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $164.25. This valuation indicates that the Alphabet Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -2.68%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Generative AI is in the crosshairs at Meta and Alphabet annual meetings as shareholders vote for detailed reports",
        "Author": "  Sharon Goldman ",
        "Text": "Generative AI is on the ballot at Big Tech companies like Meta and Alphabet, as shareholders vote on proposals calling for detailed reports by the companies about how the technology is being used to create and spread misinformation. The shareholder proposals, which will be voted on at each company\u2019s upcoming annual general meeting, reflect growing concerns about the power and prevalence of generative AI.\nThe votes come as Google has faced massive blowback over the past week for its new search AI features, which has produced false and often bizarre responses, including telling users to put glue on pizza. Audio and video deepfakes created by AI technology are also proliferating online, raising concerns in an election year.\nShareholders in Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, will vote at the company\u2019s annual meeting on Wednesday, while investors in Google-parent company Alphabet will weigh in at the company\u2019s annual meeting on June 7. The resolutions come just a few months after a similar proposal at Microsoft\u2019s AGM on December 7, 2023, which was presented by Nirvana co-founder and bassist Krist Novoselic and garnered 21% of the shareholder vote.\nThe three proposals were led by ESG activist investor group Arjuna Capital and focus on concerns that generative AI threatens to amplify misinformation and disinformation around the world, particularly during a critical election year in countries like the US and India. A separate shareholder proposal brought to Apple focused on the risks of AI to workers, which was filed by the AFL-CIO Equity Index Funds, the largest labor union federation in the US. While the proposal was ultimately voted down by Apple shareholders at its annual meeting in February, proponents of AI transparency won a victory beforehand when the SEC ruled that companies like Apple could not bar shareholders from voting on such matters.\nIn the proxy statement for Meta's annual meeting, the shareholder proposal states that \"with Meta\u2019s recent development of gAI products, including conversational assistants and advertising tools, the company is increasingly at risk from misinformation and disinformation generated through its own products.\"\nThe proposal calls for the Meta board to \u201cissue a report, at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary or legally privileged information, to be published within one year of the Annual Meeting and updated annually thereafter, assessing the risks to the Company\u2019s operations and finances, and to public welfare, presented by the Company\u2019s role in facilitating misinformation and disinformation disseminated or generated via generative Artificial Intelligence; what steps the Company plans to take to remediate those harms; and how it will measure the effectiveness of such efforts.\u201d\nIn its response urging shareholders to reject the proposal, Meta pointed to its \u201cfive pillars of Responsible AI\u201d which are overseen by its board of directors, as well as its investments in safety and security efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation.\n\u201cGiven our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes that the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders,\u201d the Proxy Report said.\nIn a response to a similar proposal, Alphabet said that its Board of Directors recommended a vote against the stockholder proposal because \u201cOur enterprise risk frameworks, product policies, and tools provide a foundation for identifying and mitigating AI-generated mis/disinformation and other potential risks,\u201d adding that \u201cwe continually strive to improve the quality of our generative AI models and applications through both pre-launch testing and ongoing fine-tuning, and we are transparent about our ongoing work via public reporting.\u201d\nThe proposals for AI reports at Meta and Alphabet are unlikely to be approved, as both companies have dual class stock that concentrates the voting power in the hands of the founders. Still, the proposals carry symbolic power and have the potential to send a message to management if they earn widespread support from shareholders.\nAt December\u2019s Microsoft AGM, Novoselic served as the spokesperson for the shareholder initiative, describing himself as a long-time shareholder. He accused the company of racing forward, \u201creleasing this nascent technology without the appropriate guardrails.\u201d Generative AI, he continued, \u201cis a game-changer, there\u2019s no question, but the rush to market seemingly prioritizes short term profits over long-term success.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 17, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet GOOGL, Datadog DDOG, Garmin GRMN, Salesforce CRM and CrowdStrike CRWD.\nWall Street witnesses a new big bull as inflation resumes a downward trend. This is evident from the latest Consumer Price Index (\u201cCPI\u201d) report released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which shows that U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in April 2024.\nThe CPI rose 0.3% over the previous month and 3.4% over the prior year in April. This indicates a deceleration from March 2024, in which CPI grew 3.5%. Economists are of the view that price pressure will be down gradually and, thus, inflation will eventually incline toward the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2%. This, in turn, has raised hopes of investors regarding interest rate cuts by the Fed in September 2024.\nCooling inflation has pushed the stocks to record highs. The S&P 500 index closed at $5,308.15 on Wednesday, exceeding the mark of $5,300 for the first time. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite surged 1.4%, closing at $16,742.39, whereas the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached the $40,000 milestone, closing at $39,908 yesterday.\nInvestors looking for growth opportunities should consider investing in technology stocks in the current scenario. The likelihood of interest rate cuts bodes well for growth-oriented tech stocks. Lower interest rates are expected to boost cash inflows, especially free cash flows in the future, which remains crucial for growth-seeking tech stocks. Free cash flows help companies in pursuing acquisitions and investments in technical advancements.\nLower interest rates will reduce the cost of borrowings of the technology companies, which will likely bolster their growth prospects.\nIn addition, lower inflation will enable enterprises to sign multi-year agreements, which, in turn, will help technology companies win several valuable deals.\nThe growing proliferation of generative AI technology remains a major positive for the technology sector. The ability to interact with humans, respond to questions asked in various languages, generate content, classify data and perform coding on the back of large language models (LLM) are bolstering the adoption of generative AI-backed chatbots.\nIncreasing adoption of Machine Learning, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality devices, quantum computing and cloud computing have been contributing well to the performances of the technology companies.\nGrowing demand for data centers, driven by the need for increasing cloud capacity to support AI-related workloads, is acting as a tailwind. Apart from his, strong momentum across customer relationship software, employee management tools, natural language processing tools, time tracking tools and cyber security software is highly benefiting the software companies.\nTechnical advancements in Internet infrastructure and the accelerated deployment of 5G technology worldwide are tailwinds. IoT-supported industrial automation, rising PC shipment andgrowing demand for smart electric appliances, wearables, electric vehicles and drones are other positives.\nGiven this booming scenario, it is prudent for investors to place bets on tech companies such as Alphabet, Datadog, Garmin, Salesforce and CrowdStrike for superb returns.\nThese stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space.\nAlphabet is benefiting from growing generative AI capabilities. It is cashing in on the increasing demand for LLMs with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Its Google division is gaining from solid momentum in the cloud business. Expanding data centers and strengthening its generative AI-backed cloud portfolio are positives. Google\u2019s improving search engine, on the back of major search updates, and strength in YouTube remain the key catalysts. Alphabet\u2019s deepening focus on the wearables category and expanding presence in the autonomous driving space are other positives.\nGOOGL has gained 42.7% over a year. It currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 11.8% to $7.57 per share in the past 60 days. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nDatadog is benefiting from strength in customer demand for offerings in modern observability, cloud security, software delivery and cloud service management. The solid adoption of its cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform, owing to the accelerated digital transformation and cloud migration across organizations, remains a plus. Further, a solid cloud partner base, including Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, is contributing well to its financial performance. The company is witnessing strong customer momentum due to its significant investments in sales and marketing to engage customers, increase brand awareness and drive the adoption of its platform and products.\nDatadog has gained 29.8% in the past year. It currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 8.5% to $1.54 per share in the past 60 days.\nGarmin is gaining from strong momentum in its Fitness segment, owing to solid demand for its advanced wearables. Also, its expanding adventure watch portfolio is driving its momentum among adventure enthusiasts. Strength in its OEM product categories is benefiting the company\u2019s performance in the aviation industry. In addition, Garmin\u2019s expanding footprint in the automotive space remains a tailwind. Its strong relationship with BMW on the back of its robust domain controllers is a positive.\nGarmin has gained 65.7% in the past year. It currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 0.5% to $5.58 per share in the past 60 days.\nSalesforce is gaining from a strong demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Its sustained focus on aligning products with customer needs is driving the top line. Continued deal wins in the international market are other growth drivers. The buyout of Slack has positioned the company as a leader in enterprise team collaboration software and improved its competitive standing versus Microsoft Teams. Salesforce\u2019s strategy of continuously expanding generative AI offerings remains a plus.\nSalesforce has gained 37.3% in the past year. It currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 0.3% to $9.71 per share in the past 60 days.\nCrowdStrike is benefiting from the solid demand for cyber-security solutions due to a slew of data breaches, and the increasing need for security and networking products amid the growing hybrid working trend. Continued digital transformation and cloud migration strategies adopted by organizations are key growth drivers. The company\u2019s portfolio strength, mainly the Falcon platform\u2019s 10 cloud modules, boosts its competitive edge and helps add users. Additionally, strategic acquisitions, such as Bionic and Reposify, remain noteworthy.\nCrowdStrike has gained 150% in the past year. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 0.5% to $3.90 per share in the past 60 days.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock That Could Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Manali Pradhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The U.S. stock market has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth over the past decade despite multiple economic challenges and geopolitical pressures. This environment has helped pave the way for high-growth companies such as Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft to reach the coveted trillion-dollar market capitalization.\nThese companies have demonstrated powerful and scalable business models, visionary management, and rapid organic and inorganic market expansion. Plus, these companies have quickly adopted technologies such as data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing.\nOnly a few other companies share similar characteristics and may be next in line to cross the trillion-dollar market capitalization mark by 2030. Here's why Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) fits the bill and may soon join the trillion-dollar club.\nThe increasing demand for accelerated computing infrastructure and AI-driven data centers has been the major growth catalyst for Broadcom, especially for the networking business in the past couple of years. In fiscal 2024's first quarter, ended Feb. 4, Broadcom's AI revenue quadrupled year over year to $2.3 billion, offsetting the cyclical slowdown in other businesses. The company now expects AI-related revenue to account for almost 35% of its fiscal 2024 semiconductor revenue at $10 billion , up from its previous estimate of $8 billion.\nThis upward revision can be mainly attributed to the solid demand for its custom AI chips and networking solutions such as Tomahawk 5 800G switches, Ethernet, digital signal processing (DSP) platforms, and optical components by large-scale enterprises deploying AI data centers and hyperscale customers.\nBesides catering to enterprise AI demand, Broadcom's networking solutions are also used extensively in consumer-facing AI applications. In its fiscal Q1 2024 earnings call, management highlighted the strong demand for the company's custom AI chips at two hyperscalers .\nAlthough the company has not disclosed the names of these clients, many analysts have zeroed in on Alphabet and Meta Platforms. Since these clients own vast amounts of data and have a very large subscriber base, they stand to benefit dramatically from the use of custom AI chips in targeted areas such as search, SEO, and digital marketing. Since Broadcom seems to have cultivated deep, strategic, and multi-year relationships with these hyperscalers, it is well-positioned to develop custom AI chips catering to their specific needs.\nBroadcom has a proven track record of designing and manufacturing high-performance and energy-efficient custom AI chips as well as multiple AI-optimized networking components capable of handling complex workloads for foundational models and large language applications. Coupled with the company's long-term relationships with its clients and a supporting software ecosystem, Broadcom is poised to thwart competition from new players in the custom silicon space.\nThe acquisition of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions player VMware is also proving to be a major growth catalyst for Broadcom. In the first quarter, the company's infrastructure software revenue was up 153% year over year to $4.6 billion, with VMware contributing almost $2.1 billion during the 10.5 weeks of the quarter (as the acquisition was completed in November 2023).\nConsolidated software bookings grew nearly three times year over year to $1.8 billion in the first quarter and are expected to reach $3 billion in the second quarter. Broadcom expects revenue from the VMware portfolio to grow sequentially by a double-digit percentage every quarter throughout fiscal 2024.\nBroadcom's VMware strategy mainly involves upselling VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) to existing customers, especially those already running compute workloads with vSphere virtualization tools. VCF is a complete software stack, which includes computing, storage, and networking capabilities, and acts as an alternative and complement to the public cloud platforms for the customers' on-premise data centers.\nThe company is focusing on developing an improved VCF stack to sell to its largest 2,000 strategic customers, many of whom need a hybrid cloud solution (mix of private and public cloud infrastructure) for their on-premise distributed data centers. Broadcom has also partnered with Nvidia to form VMware Private AI Foundation, which enables VCF to run GPUs. This initiative is helping further drive demand for VCF.\nThe global virtualization software market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 22.3% from $40 billion in 2023 to $300 billion in 2033. Broadcom seems well-poised to capitalize on this opportunity, thanks to the synergies between its software offerings and acquired VMware portfolio. The company expects its overall software revenue to be $20 billion in fiscal 2024, which will end Oct. 31.\nBroadcom's hardware and software offerings are used in multiple end markets including smartphones, telecommunications, and a variety of industrial applications. The diversified client base has made the overall business resilient since fluctuations in a few end markets can be partly offset by others.\nBroadcom shares are currently trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 16.6, significantly higher than their five-year average of 9.3. However, considering the company's ability to capitalize on the growing demand for accelerated computing and data center infrastructure across industries, this high valuation seems justified.\nThe company is poised to generate revenue of $50.2 billion in fiscal 2024. Assuming its P/S ratio remains constant (due to AI tailwinds), the company will have to grow its revenue to about $61 billion to support a $1 trillion market capitalization. This seems to be a very achievable target, since analysts are projecting Broadcom's revenue to grow to $62.8 billion by fiscal 2026.\nHence, it makes sense for long-term retail investors to consider buying at least a small stake in this AI-powered stock.\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Broadcom wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $652,342!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "This year already saw two new companies' market caps surpass $2 trillion, and a third is poised to hit that milestone.\nThe current members of the $2 trillion club are some of the most well-respected names in their fields, and all of their businesses revolve around technology.\nMicrosoft ($3 trillion) established itself as an AI leader with a smart investment in OpenAI. Its Azure cloud computing platform and enterprise software business reap the benefits.\nApple ($2.8 trillion) sells the iPhone and operates a growing services ecosystem built around its devices.\nNvidia ($2.2 trillion) sits at the forefront of the AI trend as a supplier of the most sought-after chips for large language model training.\nAlphabet ($2.1 trillion) owns the most popular search engine, Google, operating a massive advertising business, and one of the biggest cloud computing platforms in the market.\nThe next company likely to join them also heavily invested in tech, including cloud computing and digital advertising. But its core business, retail, also shows a ton of potential for earnings growth. That company is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\nThree important pieces of Amazon's business are benefiting from various trends. But investors shouldn't discount the operational excellence that Amazon's management team exhibited to take advantage of those trends.\nAmazon is a key player in the booming AI trend. As demand for generative AI capabilities expands, cloud computing segment Amazon Web Services (AWS) is building out its capabilities to meet that demand.\nCEO Andy Jassy says he likes to think of AI development in three layers. At the base layer, Amazon offers developers compute instances powered by Nvidia GPUs and its own custom Trainium 2 chips. It also offers a service, SageMaker, that makes training a large language model easier by managing customer training data. In the middle layer, it offers Amazon Bedrock for anyone looking to build on top of existing large language models. Developers can expand on existing models and build custom AI apps using Bedrock's tool set. At the top layer are existing AI-powered applications running on the cloud.\nAll three layers have contributed to the reacceleration of Amazon Web Services' revenue growth. The segment's revenue run rate surpassed $100 million in the first quarter.\nThe second trend is digital advertising. Despite how prevalent digital advertising is these days, it remains an opportunity for Amazon. The company saw great success with its sponsored product listings. In January, it started including video ads in Prime Video by default, adding another opportunity for sales growth. That said, management still says it thinks there are growth opportunities in its core display ad business.\nIts advertising revenue climbed 24% year over year last quarter, and exceeded $49 billion over the trailing 12 months.\nAmazon's original business, online retail, remains a big opportunity. Despite relatively slow growth for online store sales, third-party seller services, and subscription services (which mostly consists of Prime memberships), the real story is its expanding operating margin. North American operating margin climbed to 5.8% from 1.2% a year ago. That margin expansion was fueled by more efficient shipping operations as Amazon overhauled its logistics network. International operating income turned positive in the first quarter, a major milestone for the company.\nSmall improvements in operating margin go a long way when a business generates $500 billion per year in revenue.\nAs of this writing, Amazon's market cap sits just shy of $2 trillion. The stock needs to gain just 3% for the company to reach that milestone, and that could happen any day. Given the significant trends lifting its business and its operational successes, it shouldn't take long for the market to push it over the top.\nThat's especially true considering that the stock trades at a fair valuation. Its enterprise-value-to-sales ratio is 3.2, and analysts on average expect 11% sales growth both this year and next year. But with the expanding operating margin, it should produce earnings and free cash flow growth that far exceeds its revenue growth. And its price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of about 40 looks downright cheap compared to Amazon's historic levels.\nAt its current price, Amazon has an opportunity to surpass a $2 trillion valuation and never look back.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $559,743!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 10, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Alphabet GOOGL, PDD Holdings PDD and PulteGroup PHM.\nJust a couple of weeks ago investors were fearing the worst. Inflation was coming in hot, interest rates cuts were off the table, and analysts were shouting about stagflation. Now just a few days later, broad equity indexes are again approaching all-time highs.\nAll it took as a measly -6% selloff in the S&P 500 to start scaring investors out of positions in good stocks. When small pullbacks like the one at the end of April are met with vigorous buying like we saw these last couple weeks, you know the bull market is intact.\nThe hiccups that cause mini selloffs are fantastic buying opportunities.\nThe US economy is extremely robust in the face of record high interest rates. US household wealth is at all-time highs encouraging consumer spending, the US government is spending on big infrastructure projects such as semiconductors and nuclear energy, and though there may be a slight delay, expansionary monetary policy is on its way.\nRising consumer and government spending grows earnings, and falling interest rates will increase liquidity. These are the driving factors in markets, and they are pointing to a continuing bull market now.\nFurthermore, this bull market is still in the early innings. Amazing businesses are still trading for very reasonable and even discount valuations and are ripe for the discerning investor.\nThe Zacks Rank continuously amazes me with its ability to identify leading stocks, and here I will show you three of my favorites. Not only do these stocks have top Zacks Ranks, but they are also showing relative strength, cheap valuations, and have rock solid business fundamentals and growth.\nGoogle parent company Alphabet experienced some hefty upgrades to its earnings estimates this last week, boosting it to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating.\nAnalysts have unanimously revised earnings estimates higher, with FY24 climbing by nearly 12%. EPS are forecast to grow at 17.2% annually over the next 3-5 years, which is an incredible pace for a mammoth company like Alphabet.\nPrice action in Alphabet stock has also made some encouraging advances in recent months. After showing some questionable action early in the year, GOOGL stock has significantly outperformed the Nasdaq index and its mega-cap technology counterparts over the last three months.\nAdditionally, it has been forming what looks like a compelling bull flag. If the stock can break out from the recent highs, it should make another bull run.\nPDD Holdings also known as Pinduoduo, is a Chinese e-commerce platform that specializes in group buying deals. It utilizes a social commerce model, encouraging users to share deals with friends and family to unlock additional discounts. The company's business model focuses on leveraging social networks and innovative marketing strategies to drive sales and engagement.\nRevenue at PDD Holdings has exploded in the last few years, growing annual sales from $2 billion in 2018 to $35 billion in the last year. This huge pace of growth is expected to continue with sales expected to climb 50% this year and 35% next year.\nPinduoduo has also seen some hefty upgrades to its earnings estimates, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Current quarter earnings were revised higher by 27% over the last two months and FY24 have increased by 18% over the same period.\nPDD Holdings is currently trading at a significant discount too. Its one year forward earnings multiple of 16.5x is well below the market average, and its two-year median of 25.6x.\nBut what makes this valuation appear especially cheap is PDD\u2019s PEG Ratio which considers EPS growth. Over the next 3-5 years EPS are forecast to grow 49.3% annually, giving it a PEG ratio of just 0.3.\nPulteGroup, one of the leading homebuilding businesses in the US and recently jumped up to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reflecting strongly upward trending earnings revisions.\nPulteGroup along with the other homebuilder stocks are extremely well positioned for the current economic environment.\nWhile some investors worry about the strong price appreciation in the residential home market over the last few years, it is unlikely to slow down. The reality of the US home market is that there is a huge shortage of available housing. Not even 7% mortgage rates could slow down the market!\nBecause of the limited supply of housing, homebuilders are likely to score strong profits in the coming years.\nBut what makes PulteGroup especially appealing is its earnings growth expectation in relation to its valuation.\nPHM is currently trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 9.2x, which is just below its 10-year median of 9.6x and the industry average of 10.4x. But analysts are anticipating EPS to grow 17.7% annually over the next 3-5 years, giving PulteGroup a PEG ratio of 0.52.\nThat is an extremely appealing level based on the metric.\nFor investors looking to add exposure to stocks, these three stocks are worth diving into.\nI also particularly like this mix of stocks because it gives you a rather broad and diversified mix of companies. You have big tech, which include cloud, content and search at Alphabet, housing with PulteGroup, and China with PDD Holdings.\nDiversification like this gives investors the luxury of various exposures. So, if one sector or geography underperforms, there is a possibility another will outperform.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 28, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Alphabet GOOGL and Arista Networks ANET.\nNvidiareported earnings this week and posted another quarter of stunning growth, beating analysts' estimates on both the top and bottom line and announcing a ten-for-one stock split.\nNvidia continues to completely dominate the AI infrastructure industry, providing all the major technology businesses of the world with the GPUs and data center products required to run the extremely demanding models.\nThe word \"dominating\" almost doesn't capture the influence this company is having on the industry, and its outrageous growth rates are truly something to behold.\nQuarterly revenue of $26 billion was up 18% from the prior quarter and 262% YoY, while Data Center revenue of $22.6 billion was up 23% on the quarter and 427% on the year.\nNet income for the quarter was $14.8 billion and is up 628% YoY. To put that growth into perspective, Nvidia's total annual revenue in 2021 was $16 billion, which is now about how much profit they make in just a quarter!\nSometimes in the market we see growth stocks with great stories, and huge growth projections go on incredible runs in a short period, only to fall back to earth when the growth doesn't materialize. That is not what's happening at Nvidia.\nGrowth at Nvidia has already been realized with sales and earnings having already climbed many multiples over just the last year, and with more to come.\nAs of right now sales for this year are expected to increase 77.6% to $108 billion, but next year's sales growth is still fairly tepid, with forecasts of 20.5%. While this year's estimates are lofty, analysts remain grounded as they look further out.\nWith just 20% growth projected for next year, we could even see more upside surprises.\nWhen looking at relative valuations, Nvidia is actually cheaper than it was a year ago. At the beginning of 2023, NVDA was trading at a forward earnings multiple of about 90x, while today it is trading at 45.3x FY24 earnings estimates and just 36x FY25 earnings estimates.\nWhile yes, Nvidia's stock has appreciated nearly 4x over the last year, earnings have outpaced that growth! Earnings are up nearly 6x in that time, and margins have expanded from 18.5% to 54.3%.\nWith those growth rates, and improved business fundamentals, you could argue that Nvidia deserves an even richer earnings multiple.\nI don't know about other research publications, but at Zacks we have been all over Nvidia this last year. In the chart below we can see that earnings estimates began to rise in Q2 2023, and at that time it jumped onto the Zacks Rank.\nIt has enjoyed a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating for nearly that entire time, besides occasional periods of dropping down to a Rank #2, when analysts took breaks from upgrading it.\nA number of contributors here have been pounding the table about buying Nvidia stock, and if you look back, I have published a number of bullish writeups over the last year.\nEven with the reasons shared here, many investors will still resist buying Nvidia stock, and I do understand the psychological difficulties with buying a stock that has rallied so much already. So, for those investors I will share my other top picks to ride the AI wave.\nAlphabet has quickly jumped near the front of the AI expansion. At its most recent developer conference, Alphabet shared a number of exciting new AI integration to its suite of products.\nAI Agents, they call them, will act as an assistant across Gmail, Search, and Android devices.\nAlphabet also boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, as well as a historically discounted valuation. Trading at 22.8x forward earnings, it is below its 10-year median of 26.2x.\nAdditionally, Alphabet stock has been showing considerable relative strength against most of the other mega-cap technology stocks, outperforming all the Magnificent Seven excluding Nvidia in the last three months.\nAnother AI beneficiary with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating is Arista Networks.\nLess well known than most of its AI counterparts, Arista Networks specializes in high-performance, software-driven network switches and routers for data centers, cloud computing, and large-scale enterprise environments.\nArista Networks plays a crucial role in the AI boom by providing the advanced networking infrastructure required for AI workloads. Its high-speed, low-latency switches and routers facilitate the efficient data flow and massive computational power needed for AI and machine learning applications.\nNot everyone has missed this quiet AI-winner though, as analysts have been steadily raising earning estimates over the last year, and the stock has rallied nearly 100% over the last year.\nIn just the last two days I have had a number of people reaching out and asking, \"is it too late to buy Nvidia?\" And my answer is no, it probably isn't too late.\nOf course, it would have been better to buy it last year when it was trading at $200, but even at $1,045 per share there is still upside. However, with a market cap of $2.5 trillion now, the upside is unlikely to be as pronounced as when it was much smaller.\nFortunately for investors, there are additional stocks to get involved in for exposure to the AI boom, and this new technology will likely lead markets for the foreseeable future.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "1 Unstoppable Stock Set to Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Anthony Di Pizio, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The U.S. economy has a century-long track record of producing the world's most valuable companies:\nUnited States Steel became the world's first $1 billion company in 1901.\nBy 1955, General Motors became the first $10 billion company.\nIndustrial giant General Electric rode its portfolio of businesses -- from aerospace to financial services -- to a $100 billion valuation in 1995.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) crossed the next big threshold in 2018 when it became the first publicly traded company to amass a $1 trillion market capitalization.\nToday, Apple is joined by Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia in the trillion-dollar club. But I think one more company is on the cusp of earning membership.\nWarren Buffett has led Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) to a whopping 4,384,748% return since 1965, giving it a valuation of nearly $900 billion. The conglomerate owns substantial positions in private and public success stories like GEICO, Coca-Cola, and even Apple.\nHere's why Berkshire could become the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club within the next 12 months.\nBuffett is a quintessential value investor. He likes to buy good businesses at a cheap price, and sometimes great businesses at a fair price, with the intention of holding on to them for decades. He looks for companies with steady growth, consistent profitability, and strong management teams. He especially likes businesses that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\nHere's an example that perfectly displays the effects of compounding that helped Buffett build his empire. Berkshire spent $1.3 billion accumulating shares of American Express (NYSE: AXP) between 1991 and 1995. That holding has grown in value to a staggering $36.8 billion today. Even better, Amex stock makes Berkshire money just for owning it, paying Berkshire $364 million in dividends in 2023 alone. That dividend means Berkshire recoups its entire initial investment in Amex every four years just from the dividends. That's just one of the conglomerate's many success stories.\nBerkshire was originally a textiles business, and it was on the verge of failure when Buffett stepped in to buy it in 1965. When he realized he couldn't turn it around, he transformed it into a holding company for various investments.\nSince then, Berkshire has purchased many companies outright, including GEICO, Duracell, and Dairy Queen. But it also owns a portfolio of 47 publicly traded stocks and securities worth $377.9 billion. This portfolio includes its shares of Amex, Coca-Cola, and Apple.\nApple is Berkshire's single largest holding, with a value of $149.9 billion accounting for 39.7% of its stock portfolio. It would be even larger, but the conglomerate recently sold 13% of its position (reportedly for tax reasons). Considering Berkshire only spent around $38 billion accumulating Apple shares since 2016, this investment has seriously paid off.\nI want to take a moment to highlight the Coca-Cola stake, too. Berkshire spent $1.3 billion buying shares of the beverage giant between 1988 and 1994, and it has never sold any of them. Today, that position is worth $25.2 billion, and it paid Berkshire $736 million in dividends in 2023 alone.\nYou might notice the Coca-Cola story sounds very similar to the Amex story, and its is. What it points out is that Buffett didn't catch lightning in a bottle, nor is his strategy exceptional. In fact, Berkshire's long-term positions in Bank of America, Visa, and Moody's followed a similar trajectory, thanks to Buffett's simple formula centered around patient investing.\nIf investors are willing to maintain a long-term view, they can also reap the benefits of compounding in the same way.\nBerkshire Class A shares soared in value by 4,384,748% between 1965 and 2023. That translates into a compound annual return of 19.8%, which is nearly twice the 10.2% average annual return in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\nThe outperformance is mind-boggling in dollar terms. An investment of $1,000 in Berkshire stock in 1965 would have been worth $43.8 million at the end of 2023! The same investment in the S&P 500 would be worth just $312,230.\nBerkshire has the financial results to support its incredible returns. The business generated $49.3 million in revenue during 1965, a figure which grew to $364.4 billion last year. Berkshire's diverse portfolio of businesses contributed to the latter number: $83.4 billion came from insurance premiums; $101.4 billion came from its railroad, utilities, and energy businesses; and $155.6 billion came from sales and services across the various entities under Berkshire's umbrella.\nBerkshire also grew its net earnings from just $2.3 million in 1965 to a whopping $96.2 billion in 2023.\nConsidering Berkshire has a market capitalization of nearly $900 billion as of this writing, its stock only needs to gain 11% from here to catapult the company into the $1 trillion club. Its 58-year-long track record of delivering 19.8% annual returns (on average) suggests it's a shoo-in to get there within the next 12 months.\nA few things will work in Berkshire's favor going forward. For starters, Apple just announced a $100 billion stock buyback, which is the largest in the history of corporate America. That will organically increase the conglomerate's equity stake in the iPhone maker. Plus, top holdings like Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola continue to raise their dividends, so Berkshire will likely earn a record payout this year.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is also likely to cut interest rates in the second half of 2024. That could spark an increase in economic activity which should boost many of the businesses in Berkshire's portfolio, especially those serving consumers and those in the transport and logistics industries.\nFinally, Buffett continues to be a big believer in the company's future. He authorized the repurchase of $9.2 billion worth of Berkshire's shares in 2023 and a further $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Buffett has now overseen $71.4 billion worth of share repurchases since 2020 alone, which is more than he has deployed into any other stock.\nAbsent any external economic shocks, Berkshire appears almost certain to be the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club in the coming year.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Michael Burry published a first-quarter portfolio update on Wednesday.\nThe Scion Asset Management chief pared down his stock positions from 25 to 16 but boosted several bets.\nBurry is known for his wager against the mid-2000s housing bubble, chronicled in\u00a0\"The Big Short.\"\nMichael Burry ramped up his bets on a raft of stocks while slashing his number of holdings last quarter.\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame pared down his portfolio from 25 positions to 16 in the three months ending in March, he revealed in a quarterly portfolio update on Wednesday. The total value of his holdings rose from about $95 million to about $103 million.\nEleven holdings survived the period, and the Scion Asset Management boss added to all of them. For example, he boosted his stake in Alibaba from 75,000 shares to 125,000, his JD.com bet from 200,000 to 360,000, and his Star Bulk Carriers wager from 250,000 to 400,000.\nBurry also added five new holdings to his collection: Baidu, BP, First Solar, Sprott Physical Gold Trust, and Cigna. He also disposed of a bunch of stocks including Amazon, Alphabet, MGM Resorts, Toast, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\nThe Scion chief is best known for his monster wager against the mid-2000s housing bubble, which was immortalized in the book and movie \"The Big Short.\"\nHe also drew attention for investing in GameStop more than a year before it became a meme stock in early 2021. The frenzy around the video games retailer reignited this week after one of its biggest proponents, investor Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill, returned to social media after a yearslong hiatus.\nBurry's latest portfolio update didn't feature any put options. The investor has previously held the bearish options on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes, Apple stock, a microchip ETF containing Nvidia, Elon Musk's Tesla, and Cathie Wood's flagship Ark fund.\nThe value investor is well known for his grave warnings and grim predictions about market crashes and economic catastrophes. For instance, he sounded the alarm on the \"greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things\" in the summer of 2021, and cautioned that buyers of meme stocks and cryptocurrencies would be caught in the \"mother of all crashes.\"\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"
