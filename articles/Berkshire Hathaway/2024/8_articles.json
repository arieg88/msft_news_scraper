        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway now holds more short-term Treasurys than the Federal Reserve.\nThe firm increased its holdings by 81% year-to-date through June, now owning $234.6 billion.\nIt's on track to generate annual risk-free interest of about $12 billion.\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway now owns more short-term Treasurys than the Federal Reserve.\nThe company held $234.6 billion in short-term US Treasury Bills at the end of the second quarter, according to its latest earnings release. That's up 81% from the roughly $130 billion it owned at the end of 2023.\nIt also eclipses the Federal Reserve's T-bill holdings, which stood at $195.3 billion as of last week.\nBuffett's preference for Treasurys is reflective of him being unable to find worthy investments that exceed the more-than-5% annualized risk-free offered by government debt. It has some worried that the billionaire investor has soured on the US stock market. He has historically raised cash when he sees few attractive opportunities to invest due to elevated valuations.\nFor context, the 1-month T-Bill yields 5.33%, the 3-month T-Bill at 5.22%, and the 6-month T-Bill at 4.95%.\nThose interest rates should generate risk-free gains of about $12 billion annually for Berkshire Hathaway's massive T-Bill holdings, or quarterly gains of about $3 billion.\nAt Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett called T-Bills \"the safest investment there is.\"\nTreasury bills also offer their investors tax incentives, as the interest paid is exempt from state and local taxes.\nThe Treasury additions weren't the only bold move by Berkshire in the second quarter. The company also cut its stake in Apple stock by about half during the period, selling about 390 million shares.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Text": "Just about everyone who might read this article probably knows that Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), has been a phenomenal investor \u2014 for decades. He displays his company's growth and performance over the years in each annual report, and per the last one (for 2023), the overall gain from 1965 to 2023 was 4,384,748%. Yes, that's 4.3 million! Annualized, it's 19.8% per year. Of course, few of us invested in this amazing company way back in 1965.\nSo what would you have now if you'd invested $10,000 in Berkshire Hathaway just 10 years ago? Well, the answer might surprise you: You'd have $31,797 \u2014 which is 12.26% annually, on average. If you're disappointed, know that you'd still be ahead of the S&P 500 \u2014 which averaged 11.61% over the same period.\nBerkshire is simply growing more slowly in recent years, in part because it has grown so big. Its market value was recently $950 billion. Buffett is sitting on some $277 billion in cash, much of which he can deploy by buying more businesses, but he's picky, insisting on high quality and a reasonable valuation.\nShould you invest in Berkshire Hathaway now? Well, don't do so if you're looking for annual gains in the 20% range year after year. The stock is up about 23% year to date as of this writing, but its three-year average is 15%, and it may average only 8% or 10% over the next few years. No one knows.\nBut if you're looking for a solid investment that's very likely to grow over time, do consider the stock. Berkshire is a big conglomerate, with a wide range of businesses \u2014 including insurance, energy, homebuilding, jewelry, candy, transportation, and much more. And it owns a lot of stock in other companies \u2014 recently 21% of American Express, 9% of Coca-Cola, 2.5% of Apple, and nearly 12% of Bank of America.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " David Hollerith    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) surpassed a market cap of $1 trillion for the first time on Wednesday as it continues to sell some holdings in Bank of America (BAC).\nBerkshire is the first outside the tech world to reach that exclusive territory in the US, which currently includes just six other companies.\nThe move comes after Berkshire disclosed late Tuesday that it had trimmed its stake in the nation's second-largest lender by another 24.6 million shares, generating $982 million.\nBerkshire has sold BofA stock in five of the past six weeks starting in mid-July, unloading a total of 129 million shares and earning $5.4 billion on those sales.\nBank of America\u2019s stock has fallen by more than 9% during Buffett\u2019s selling spree. It is still up roughly 18% so far this year, trailing larger gains by rivals Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Citigroup (C).\nBofA\u2019s stock was up more than 1% in Wednesday morning trading.\nBerkshire has not yet said anything about the motivation for selling some of its Bank of America stock. And it remains the bank\u2019s largest stockholder, with over 900 million shares worth more than $35 billion.\nThe recent moves are notable because of Buffett\u2019s long history with the bank. He injected $5 billion into Bank of America in 2011 as the lender struggled to overcome the wreckage of the subprime housing meltdown that caused the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nIt wasn't solely a bet on Bank of America's recovery but also on the new leadership of CEO Brian Moynihan, who took over the top job in 2009.\nThe endorsement from Buffett certainly helped restore some market confidence in the bank. Its stock has since climbed nearly 400%.\nBuffett stuck with Bank of America even as he began unloading stakes in other big lenders.\nBetween 2018 and 2022 he exited giant stakes in JPMorgan, Wells Fargo (WFC), and Goldman Sachs, some just months before the banking system upheaval that began in mid-March of 2023.\nBuffett began unloading the Wells Fargo position after a series of scandals rocked the bank, including revelations that employees pressured by sales goals opened millions of accounts that customers didn't want and charged fees that weren't necessary.\n\"We're very cautious \u2026 about ownership of banks and we do remain with one bank\u2026 I like Bank of America and I like the management,\" Buffett said at Berkshire\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in May 2023.\nBy June of this year, Bank of America accounted for 15% of Berkshire\u2019s portfolio as the firm slashed its stake in Apple (AAPL).\nNow it is the company\u2019s third-biggest position behind Apple and American Express (AXP).\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Author": "  Asra Isar ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Value Investor Oldfield Partners.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A) stands against the other stocks recommended by value investor oilfield partners.\nInvestors, in general, follow herd mentality, causing share prices to drop too low after bad news and rise too high after good news, a tendency further amplified by momentum investing. However, Oldfield Partners LLP, a boutique, owner-managed fund management firm, believes that price discrepancies generated through hyped up news about a certain theme could easily distract investors from finding potential bargains \u2013 lowly valued stocks, trading at a healthy discount to their intrinsic worth.\nOldfield Partners was founded in November 2004 by Richard Oldfield. Richard holds a BA (Hons) in History from Oxford University and authored the investing book Simple but not Easy, published in 2007. He has a distinguished career in investment management and governance with his tenure at Oxford University Investment Committee and Oxford University Endowment Management Ltd as Chairman from 2007 to 2014. He is also a director of Witan Investment Trust plc and a trustee for both the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity and Canterbury Cathedral Trust.\nOldfield Partners serves a global clientele, including endowments, pensions, charities, and family offices. Oldfield Partners employs a value investing strategy with a focused, diversified portfolio, no leverage, and a long-term approach. It employs several distinct strategies: Global Equity, EAFE, Global Equity Income, Global Small cap and Emerging Markets (including EM ex China) through separate accounts or a variety of pooled funds.\nAn example of Oldfield Partners' contrarian investment philosophy is that of South Africa where political and economic crises can create opportunities to purchase quality assets at significant discounts. However, the country's structural issues, driven by poor policymaking, weakened institutions, corruption, and a hostile business environment, make the potential for high returns from low valuations less certain. Over the past decade, South African capital markets have underperformed, with negative total dollar returns compared to the S&P's annualized return of over 12%. The recent elections in May further disrupted the political status quo, adding to the uncertainty.\nOpportunity drives Oldfield Partners' investment strategy, which is why their Emerging Market Fund includes a single Russian investment\u2014Lukoil, a low-cost oil and gas producer. Before the war, the rationale for investing in the stock was its production of a globally traded, dollar-denominated commodity, making it less susceptible to Russia's domestic economy. Since the war, however, the stock has impacted the fund's performance, though it remains one of the better \"performers.\" Over the past three years, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index has declined by 17%, the oil and gas producer has risen by 62%. Despite this, sanctions have made it impossible for foreign institutions to trade its shares on the Moscow Exchange, forcing the fund to hold them at a \"nil value\" (zero). The shares remain in custody with dividends still accruing, and the fund continues to seek a legal exit strategy.\nOldfield Partners currently sees more attractive bottom-up investment opportunities in other emerging markets. Although the emerging markets are still generally improving, they make strong valuation targets. While the firm avoids making short-term predictions, their bottom-up valuation models indicate that the fund's holdings remain appealing, both in absolute terms and relative to other opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of Hosking Partners at the end of the second quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Renowned for its long-term value investing approach, the company\u2019s stock portfolio and wholly-owned subsidiaries play a significant role in its substantial financial strength.\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A) is the world's most profitable insurance company, earning $3.6 billion in underwriting profits for the 2023 fiscal year. Its portfolio includes major brands like Geico, Duracell, Dairy Queen, BNSF, and Fruit of the Loom. Berkshire Hathaway's core insurance operations generate significant investable cash, which Warren Buffett uses to achieve impressive returns.\nIn addition to its diverse business holdings, Berkshire Hathaway boasts a substantial investment portfolio valued at $332 billion as of March 31. The company also has a record cash reserve of $189 billion, positioning it well for significant acquisitions. Recently, it used part of its cash to repurchase $2.6 billion worth of its own shares in Q1.\nOverall BRK.A ranks 4th on our list of the stocks recommended by value investor oilfield partners.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently published a piece titled Homeowner\u2019s Insurance Rates Skyrocketing: 10 Best Stocks To Buy. In this article we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against the other homeowner's insurance stocks.\nInsurance is one of Warren Buffett\u2019s favorite businesses. So much insurance is the single largest revenue contributor to Buffett\u2019s firm,\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway. Its first quarter SEC filings show that Berkshire earned $89.8 billion in revenue during Q1 2024, out of which its insurance underwriting and investment income accounted for 27% or $24.6 billion in revenue.\nSeems like insurance is quite a lucrative business, and even though it sounds boring, insurance is also one of the most dynamic businesses in today\u2019s environment. This is because of climate change, which has led to a growing number of floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes in the US. In fact, climate change along with a slew of other reasons has led to soaring home insurance costs since the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the Insurance Information Institute. Between 2020 and 2022, replacement costs for homeowners insurance have soared by 55% because of increasing natural disasters and high inflation which has made construction materials expensive. In fact, cumulative insured losses from hurricanes and convective storms sat below $500 (in 2024 dollars) in 1990. As of 2023 end, these had jumped to $5,984 and $5,761, respectively.\nThese rising costs have also hit the home insurance industry hard. Insurance companies\u2019 profitability is measured through the combined ratio, which is the sum of an insurer\u2019s costs and payouts divided by the premiums collected. Naturally, a value below 100 reflects profitability, and from 2020 to 2023, the net combined ratio which also accounts for reinsurance sat at 107.3%, 103.4%, 104.7%, and 110.9% for each of the years, respectively. The value for 2023 was the worst since 2011, and it came at a time when home insurers increased their premiums by 12% \u2013 for the highest increase in 15 years. Since 2012 and 2021, the average premiums have grown by $1,034 to $1,411.\nWhile these rising home insurance premiums reflect the higher cost of doing business, the real picture is more complicated. Like inflation, where prices always go up and never come down, the same is the case for insurance premiums as well. While insurance premiums rose in the Gulf Area during Katrina, costs\u00a0were\u00a0at least $55 billion, and at least nine insurers went bankrupt, business was booming the year after in 2006. In 2006, home insurers bathed in profits, with data from A.M. Best outlining that the property and casualty industry raked in $68 billion for a 39% annual growth. For some, like the\u00a021st largest insurance company in the US by assets, their profits were a record high (it earned $5 billion). The same firm had an earnings per share of $50 early during the coronavirus pandemic and then it became a loss making entity in 2022. Naturally, regulators allowed it to increase its prices by 30%, 20%, and 14.6% in California, New Jersey, and New York. Now, Wall Street has penciled in an earnings per share of $15 for this insurance company in 2024 and expects it to grow to more than $20 in the next couple of years.\nFast forwarding to the current day, the effects of climate change and inflation can even translate into higher home prices. After fires raged through California last year, several home insurance companies stopped taking new policies. This leads to higher premiums and ends up affecting home buyers hard since they factor in the insurance cost at the end of their buying decision. And while homeowner and home buying costs might rise due to the tighter insurance market, the industry continued to struggle in 2023.\nA.M. Best\u2019s latest data reveals that 2023 was the worst year for the homeowner\u2019s insurance industry for the\u00a0worst loss this century. The sector suffered from a whopping $15.2 billion underwriting loss last year, and the rating agency didn\u2019t mince its words when it simply stated that the reason behind the losses is simply a higher number of Americans moving to the disaster prone areas of the South and the West. A.M. Best\u00a0outlines\u00a0that while the US population grew by 7.4% between 2010 and 2020, the population in the South and the West jumped by 10.2% and 9.2%, respectively. The scale of these losses meant that in 2023, the combined ratio for homeowner insurance was higher than 100 in 17 American states. If you thought that these troubles were temporary, A.M. Best was also careful to mention that \u201ca return to underwriting profitability for the segment over the near term is unlikely.\u201d\nThe next question to ask when analyzing the state of the home insurance industry in the US in 2024 is, which states are experiencing the most trouble? On this front, the New York Times provides some insight. Its research shows that instead of 17, 18 American states had a combined ratio greater than 100 last year. Leading the pack was Hawaii, which is unsurprising given that the claims from historic wildfire losses exceeded a whopping $3.3 billion \u2013 for another instance of climate related disasters disrupting the insurance industry. After Hawaii, one of the worst performing regions was Arkansas. The Bear State is notable not only for its combined ratio being greater than 100 in 2023 but also for having a near similar ratio in 2022. Severe weather events, including tornadoes, are also a key\u00a0reason\u00a0for the struggles that the Arkansas insurance industry is facing.\nCombining the difficulties that home insurance companies are facing with the shifting weather patterns, it\u2019s also relevant to check whether the same states that give insurers trouble are also witnessing an increase in homeowner insurance costs. According to data from Insurify, not only have homeowners insurance premiums jumped by 20% over the past two years to sit at $2,377 annually on average, but they will grow by an added 6% this year. Within this growth, Louisiana is expected to lead the pack and see its premiums jump by an eye watering 23% this year.\nSo, as home insurance faces a changing climate (figuratively and literally) we decided to see which home insurance stocks are finding favor from analysts.\nFor our list of the best home insurance stocks, we ranked property and casualty, diversified, and specialty home insurance companies by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q1 2024. The specialty and diversified firms were chosen to ensure completeness, and each firm was analyzed to ensure that it offered home insurance.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of insurance professionals in a boardroom overlooking a city skyline.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 119 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is the multi billion dollar investment firm owned by Warren Buffett. It earned $24.6 billion in insurance revenue during Q1 2024.\u00a0 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) operates in homeowner insurance primarily through its GEICO business. GEICO is the firm\u2019s biggest insurance business, and Buffett bought it in 1996. It has been in the business for 86 years, and due to its parent Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), GEICO benefits from more than $200 billion of cash and short term investments that can help it during the time of crisis. Since Buffett also invests through Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), his insurance companies benefit from a unique business model that generates a substantial amount of cash and provides financial backing. Its homeowners insurance business depends on part on the larger auto insurance business since GEICO focuses on offering homeowner policies to its existing auto insurance customers. Vitava Fund mentioned Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its\u00a0Q4 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cBerkshire Hathaway continues to be a very unique type of conglomerate whose investments generate huge amounts of cash and which can successfully reinvest that cash again and again over the long term. It is an almost perfect case of a snowball in the markets. Here is one interesting fact: we estimate that the intrinsic value of a single Berkshire share is currently growing at a rate of about $178 per day. When we bought the shares 12 years ago, this was less than $50 a day. The rate of growth is accelerating gradually and with minimal fluctuations. Moreover, Berkshire has additional decades of similar growth still ahead of it.\u201d\nBRK-B is the unsurprising top hedge fund insurance stock pick. But our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

After all, the conglomerate is also home to Buffett's famed investment portfolio.\nBerkshire has long been associated with insurance companies, as Buffett likes to use the float that the industry generates to make his investments. The float is simply money that insurance companies hold that has yet to be paid out in claims.\nBerkshire owns a number of insurance companies, including Geico and General Re. However, it also has a plethora of wholly-owned businesses in a variety of sectors, from railroad operator BNSF to underwear maker Fruit of the Loom.\nBerkshire stock has been a winner this year, up over 25% year to date, and sits near all-time highs. Is it too late to buy?\nOne of the most popular metrics for valuing insurance businesses is the price-to-book (P/B) metric. However, Berkshire is much more than insurance nowadays, so price-to-earnings (P/E) is another option. In either case, the stock is trading higher than it usually has.\nBRK.B Price to Book Value data by YCharts\nFor his part, Buffett previously used the P/B metric to determine if Berkshire should be buying back its shares. He used to repurchase shares only when the stock was trading below 1.1 times book, then when it was trading below 1.2 times. Later he renounced that policy. He has also stated that he does not think P/B and P/E are great metrics for a company's intrinsic value.\nNonetheless, the stock is trading at higher price-to-book multiples compared to the past few years.\nWith Buffett about to celebrate his 94th birthday at the end of August, it's quite likely he won't be running Berkshire in a decade. However, the company has a succession plan firmly in place.\nVice Chairman Ajit Jain will run Berkshire's insurance operations when Buffett is gone, while Greg Abel will be responsible for all investment and capital allocation decisions. Abel currently oversees Berkshire's non-insurance businesses.\nBoth executives took direct responsibility for their roles about five years ago, so the transition with Berkshire's owned businesses should be quite smooth. In fact, Abel is known to be tougher on many of the bosses running Berkshire's individual businesses than Buffett or his former right-hand man Charlie Munger were.\nWhat Abel hasn't been, though, is a stock picker. However, Buffett has said that Abel's understanding of business should translate into investment skill. The company also has Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who have been helping manage Berkshire's investment portfolio for more than a decade.\nWhen Buffett does eventually pass, it wouldn't be surprising to see the stock react negatively. Buffett, for his part, has said he expects the stock to rise in value on the possibility of a breakup of the conglomerate and that its individual businesses are worth more than the whole. That may be wishful thinking, although how much of a Buffett premium is built into Berkshire's stock is unknown given that his death wouldn't exactly come as a surprise.\nGiven Berkshire's current valuation and the advanced age of Buffett, I wouldn't be running out to buy the stock after its more-than-25% gain this year. That said, I think Buffett built the company to outlast him and that it will continue to be well run after he is gone.\nBerkshire has been a winner for a long time, and I expect that to continue as well. I'd just prefer to wait for a pullback to be a buyer.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Since becoming CEO at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965, Warren Buffett has delivered 19.8% compound annual returns to investors, or enough to turn a $100 investment into $4.4 million today. Buffett's extended track record of success is one reason investors eagerly await the release of Berkshire's quarterly report showing the stocks the conglomerate bought and sold during the quarter.\nOver the past three quarters, Berkshire Hathaway has bought shares of Chubb (NYSE: CB) stock hand over fist and kept its buying confidential for two quarters. Berkshire owns 26 million shares of the insurer as of March 31, worth roughly $7.2 billion today. Here's why Chubb is a smart buy for investors today.\nBuffett loves the insurance industry, going back to his days as a student at Columbia Business School. At the time, Buffett learned under Benjamin Graham, who invested in GEICO in 1948. It was one of the best-performing assets during Graham's career.\nWhen Buffett acquired Berkshire Hathaway in 1965, it was a failing textile company that was barely staying afloat. In 1967, Berkshire acquired the insurer National Indemnity, which Buffett credits as a turning point in Berkshire Hathaway's history.\nInsurance companies' cash flows make them appealing investments, which is why Buffett continues to invest heavily in them. A few years ago, Berkshire Hathaway acquired Alleghany for $11.6 billion, adding to its list of insurance companies owned by Berkshire Hathaway, including GEICO, National Indemnity, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group.\nChubb is one of the world's largest property and casualty insurance companies and underwrites various policies, including personal automotive, homeowners, accident and health, agriculture, and reinsurance.\nThe company has an excellent risk management history, which you can observe by its combined ratio. This essential insurance metric is the sum of claims costs (how much an insurance company pays out on a policy) and expenses (like employee compensation or fixed overhead) divided by the premiums the company collects.\nOver the past two decades, Chubb's average combined ratio was 90.8%, well below the industry average of 100%. This matters because it translates into free cash flow, which the company uses to pay dividends, buy back shares, or invest in things like bonds and stocks. Chubb's solid growth is why it has raised its dividend payout for 31 consecutive years.\nAnother benefit of investing in insurance is the timing of cash flows. Insurers collect premiums upfront and pay out claims down the road. In the time between, the company can invest this money, known as \"float,\" usually in short-term Treasury bills. As policies expire, companies keep their profits and can build an extensive investment portfolio over time.\nChubb has a $113 billion investment portfolio primarily invested in fixed-income securities. Last year, it earned $4.9 billion in investment income, up 32% year over year, and its yield on average invested assets improved from 3.4% to 4.2% as it benefited from rising interest rates. Through the first six months of 2024, Chubb's net investment income has increased another 27% from last year.\nThe Federal Reserve is projected to cut interest rates sometime this year and into next, which could negatively impact Chubb's investment portfolio in the short term. However, some longtime market participants think interest rates could stay elevated.\nFor example, Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management has described a \"sea change,\" saying, \"For various reasons, the Fed is not going to go back to the ultra-low interest rates over the last 13 years\" in a 2023 interview on the Motley Fool Money podcast. If that's the case, insurers like Chubb will benefit by earning more interest income than was possible in the decade and a half prior.\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also cautioned that \"there are still multiple inflationary forces in front of us\" due to fiscal deficits, rising interest rates, and stubbornly high inflation. Chubb is already a solid company to own, and if inflationary pressures persist, it has the pricing power to adapt to rising costs, giving it stellar potential for the next decade and beyond.\nBefore you buy stock in Chubb, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chubb wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Just Sold Snowflake Stock. You'll Never Believe Which Beaten-Down Value Stock It Bought Instead",
        "Author": "  Jon Quast, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "On Aug. 14, Warren Buffett's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) released its updated stock holdings for the second quarter of 2024. The biggest headline-grabbing moves were that it sold all of its shares of Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) and started a roughly $260 million position in Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA). But both of these moves make perfect sense for Berkshire.\nTo be clear, Berkshire Hathaway has plenty of money -- it had $277 billion as of its latest report. In short, it can buy virtually anything it wants; it didn't have to sell one stock to buy another. But allow me to explain how Buffett thinks about investing and why it consequently makes perfect sense for him to swap out Snowflake for Ulta Beauty in Berkshire's portfolio now.\nBerkshire Hathaway invested in Snowflake stock during its 2020 initial public offering (IPO), which may be the only time it bought an IPO stock. However, one of Buffett's proteges Todd Combs was a Snowflake customer at Geico and was conversing with Snowflake's former CEO Frank Slootman.\nThis checks two important boxes for Buffett's investing style: A personal relationship with leadership and familiarity with the product. Throughout the years, Buffett sought to buy companies and retain the leadership he trusted. And Buffett is often quoted as saying, \"Never invest in a business you cannot understand.\"\nThis likely wasn't true for Buffett personally with Snowflake stock. But Combs likely did know Slootman, and he was familiar with the business as a customer.\nHowever, things may be changing for Snowflake, and this likely contributed to Berkshire selling in the second quarter. The company reports financial results for its fiscal 2025 Q2 on Aug. 21. But as of Q1, management only expected 24% growth in fiscal 2025, down sharply from 38% growth in 2024. Moreover, its expenses are increasing as it invests more in artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe chart below shows that research and development expenses are rising as a percentage of revenue, reflecting its investment in AI. But this isn't necessarily paying off with better growth.\nAt Berkshire's annual meeting in 2018, Buffett said, \"We still love a business that takes very little capital and earns high returns, and continues to grow, and requires very little incremental capital.\" By contrast, Snowflake is spending to keep up with competition when it comes to AI, which isn't what Buffett prefers.\nNot only that, Snowflake named Sridhar Ramaswamy as its CEO earlier this year. He may be up for the task, but Combs had a personal connection with Slootman. So this may have played into Berkshire's decision to sell Snowflake stock as well.\nUlta Beauty operates about 1,400 brick-and-mortar retail stores selling cosmetic products and offering beauty services. Like Snowflake, growth has slowed -- Ulta Beauty only expects about 3% top-line growth this year. But the difference is it doesn't have to spend heavily to stay out in front of trends because the space doesn't change much. This leaves ample cash for rewarding shareholders.\nConsider that even in this upcoming slow year, Ulta Beauty expects to have a 14% operating margin -- that's really strong for a retail business. It expects to open about 60 new locations this year while remodeling about 40 more, which does have some cost. But it's modest compared to its profits. Moreover, it doesn't have any debt, meaning creditors don't have any claim on its future profits.\nThis situation leaves most of Ulta Beauty's profits for shareholders. Management intends to use $1 billion to repurchase shares in 2024 alone. For perspective, its market cap is only $17 billion as of this writing. And in fact, the company has diligently repurchased shares for years, as the chart below shows.\nWith Ulta Beauty, Buffett likely sees a simple business that's easy to understand, requires little incremental capital to stay competitive, and earns a strong profit while returning capital to shareholders. This simple scenario can make Ulta Beauty stock a winner over the long haul.\nAs the icing on the cake, Ulta Beauty stock has dropped about 35% from its highs and is now trading at one of its cheapest valuations ever at just 14 times its earnings. That's cheap -- and cheaper than most other comparable businesses. This bargain valuation makes it even more likely that the stock will earn positive returns from here, making it an ideal candidate for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in Ulta Beauty, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Ulta Beauty wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Matt DiLallo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett has famously said his favorite holding time is \"forever.\" I've bought into that mentality. I hardly ever sell stocks. \nSo, it should come as no surprise that I have no plans to ever sell my shares in Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). While his presence plays a role, it's not one of the top three reasons I plan to hold shares for the rest of my life. Here's why Berkshire Hathaway is a forever stock for me.\nBerkshire Hathaway is a financial fortress. The company ended the second quarter with a staggering $277 billion of cash on its balance sheet. That was a meaningful increase from its prior record cash balance of $189 billion at the end of the first quarter. Berkshire boosted its cash balance via its strong operating cash flow and the sale of stocks, including nearly half its stake in tech giant Apple. \nBuffett and his management team would love to deploy that money into compelling investment opportunities. However, it's not burning a hole in their pocket. At the company's annual meeting in May, Buffett told investors, \"We won't spend it unless we think [a business is] doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money.\" Right now, \"things aren't attractive.\"\nI love this discipline. It will enable Berkshire to strike when the right opportunity comes along. That should allow it to create more value for investors in the long term than if it made an acquisition just to do something when valuations are less attractive.\nBerkshire Hathaway has a diversified portfolio of wholly owned operating businesses. The company has insurance operations (including GEICO), BNSF Railway, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and an array of other companies, including various manufacturing, service, and retail operations. Berkshire hires strong, independent management teams for each business to grow its operations. \nThe company's operating businesses generate strong and growing earnings. Berkshire's operating earnings were $11.6 billion in the second quarter, up 15% from the prior year. The conglomerate retains 100% of its earnings, which it uses to grow shareholder value by repurchasing its stock, acquiring additional operating businesses, and buying stocks in its investment portfolio. The company has an excellent record of reinvesting the retained earnings of its operating companies to make more money for its shareholders. \nWarren Buffett and his management team use a portion of the company's retained earnings to invest in publicly traded companies. Its stock portfolio currently totals over $315 billion, which is roughly a third of the company's market capitalization. Notable investments include Apple (28.7% of its investment portfolio), American Express (12.2% of its investment portfolio and 21.3% of the credit giant's outstanding shares), and Occidental Petroleum (4.6% of the portfolio and 27.9% of the oil company's outstanding shares). \nBerkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio provides it with dividend income, a source of liquidity (it can sell shares to raise cash), and upside potential from stock price appreciation. Buffett and his team have done an excellent job identifying undervalued stocks with attractive total return potential. I believe Buffett's team can continue identifying great investment opportunities long after he's gone. These investments should enable the company to grow more value for shareholders than if Berkshire returned that money to them via dividends or additional repurchases. \nBerkshire Hathaway is a great company. Warren Buffett and his team have built a strong portfolio of operating businesses that generate growing earnings the company retains to enhance shareholder value. Buffett's team does that by acquiring other operating businesses and investing in publicly traded companies. The company currently has a massive cash pile, giving it lots of money to boost shareholder value when the right opportunities arise. These high-quality features are why I plan to hold shares of Berkshire Hathaway for the rest of my life.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Strengths highlight Berkshire Hathaway's robust financial position and diverse portfolio.\nWeaknesses underscore the challenges in certain sectors and reliance on key individuals.\nOpportunities emphasize the potential for strategic acquisitions and market expansion.\nThreats consider economic fluctuations and competitive pressures.\nOn August 5, 2024, Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.A) filed its 10-Q report, offering a detailed look into its financial performance for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. As a holding company with a vast array of subsidiaries, Berkshire Hathaway's core insurance segment, along with its investments in utilities, energy, manufacturing, service, and retailing, presents a complex financial landscape. The financial tables from the filing reveal a company with significant assets, including cash and Treasury Bills totaling approximately $4.1 billion, and a diverse investment portfolio. The company's consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings indicate a strong financial position, with substantial revenues and net earnings. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as presented in the latest SEC filing, providing a comprehensive view of Berkshire Hathaway's strategic position.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with MTB.\nDiversified Investment Portfolio: Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.A) boasts a diversified investment portfolio, which includes significant holdings in major companies such as Kraft Heinz and Occidental. This diversification allows the company to mitigate risks associated with market volatility and sector-specific downturns. The company's ability to hold investments until market conditions are favorable demonstrates a strategic approach to asset management, which is a testament to its financial acumen and stability.\nStrong Cash Position: The company's financials show a robust cash position, with billions in cash and Treasury Bills. This liquidity not only provides a buffer against economic downturns but also positions Berkshire Hathaway to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise. The company's strong cash position is a clear strength, as it allows for strategic flexibility and the ability to make swift decisions in a dynamic market environment.\nDependence on Key Individuals: Berkshire Hathaway's success is closely tied to the leadership of Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), its Chairman and CEO. The company's reliance on Buffett's investment prowess and decision-making is a potential weakness, as it raises concerns about succession planning and the ability to maintain its strategic edge in the post-Buffett era. This dependence on key individuals could pose a risk to the company's long-term stability and growth prospects.\nSector-Specific Challenges: Despite its diversified portfolio, Berkshire Hathaway faces challenges in certain sectors, such as the apparel industry, which has experienced low sales volumes and rising costs. These sector-specific challenges highlight the need for the company to continuously adapt and optimize its operations to remain competitive and sustain profitability across all its business segments.\nStrategic Acquisitions: Berkshire Hathaway's strong financial position and cash reserves provide the opportunity for strategic acquisitions. The company can leverage its capital to acquire businesses that align with its long-term objectives, potentially driving growth and expanding its market presence. The ability to identify and integrate valuable acquisitions is a significant opportunity for Berkshire Hathaway to enhance its portfolio and shareholder value.\nMarket Expansion: The company has the opportunity to expand into new markets and sectors, leveraging its brand reputation and financial resources. By tapping into emerging markets and industries, Berkshire Hathaway can diversify its revenue streams further and capitalize on global economic growth. Market expansion represents a strategic opportunity to build on the company's existing strengths and explore new avenues for growth.\nEconomic Fluctuations: As a global conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway is susceptible to economic fluctuations and market volatility. Changes in interest rates, inflation, and other macroeconomic factors can impact the company's investment portfolio and operating businesses. The threat of economic downturns requires Berkshire Hathaway to maintain a vigilant and adaptive approach to its investment and business strategies.\nCompetitive Pressures: The company operates in highly competitive industries, where it faces pressure from both established players and emerging challengers. The competitive landscape necessitates continuous innovation and operational efficiency to maintain market share and profitability. Berkshire Hathaway must navigate these competitive pressures to sustain its leadership position in the market.\nIn conclusion, Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK.A) presents a robust financial profile with a strong balance sheet, a diversified investment portfolio, and significant cash reserves. These strengths position the company well for strategic investments and market expansion. However, the company must address weaknesses such as its reliance on key individuals and challenges in specific sectors. Opportunities for growth through strategic acquisitions and market expansion are abundant, but threats from economic fluctuations and competitive pressures loom. Overall, Berkshire Hathaway's strategic positioning is solid, but it must remain vigilant and adaptable to navigate the dynamic market landscape.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "How much does Warren Buffett like dividends? We shouldn't draw any conclusions from the fact that Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay a dividend. The correct answer to the question is that Buffett likes dividends a lot.\nWe can be confident in this answer, by the way. Why? Roughly 72% of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is invested in just five dividend stocks.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has ranked as Berkshire's largest holding for years. Although Buffett has sold a significant portion of his stake in Apple this year, including a notable reduction of nearly half recently, it's still Berkshire's top individual stock holding by far.\nTo be sure, Apple isn't known primarily as a dividend stock. Its forward dividend yield is a paltry 0.45%. However, the iPhone maker has paid and increased its dividend every year since 2012.\nBank of America (NYSE: BAC) remains Buffett's second-biggest position, at least for now. That could soon change, though, with Buffett selling big chunks of his BofA position in recent days.\nWhile the legendary investor appears to have soured on Bank of America to some extent, he's probably still sweet on its dividend. BofA's forward dividend yield stands at nearly 2.6%. The financial services company has increased its dividend for 10 consecutive years.\nAmerican Express (NYSE: AXP) could soon take the No. 2 spot away from Bank of America. However, it's currently Berkshire's third-largest holding.\nBuffett wrote to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year that American Express paid $302 million to Berkshire in 2022. He mentioned Amex again in his latest shareholder letter, saying that the company would increase its dividend payout by around 16% in 2024. He was close: The actual increase was 17%. American Express' dividend yields 1.1%.\nBerkshire has owned shares of The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) longer than any other stock. It's also one of the conglomerate's biggest positions. Buffett thinks that Coke is a \"truly wonderful business\" that Berkshire will \"maintain indefinitely.\"\nThat's good news for Berkshire's dividend income. Coca-Cola's forward dividend yield tops 2.9%. The company is a Dividend King with 62 consecutive years of dividend increases.\nChevron (NYSE: CVX) is Buffett's fifth-largest holding. Although Buffett trimmed his position in the oil giant in the first quarter of 2024, the move followed a large purchase of the stock in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nBuffett doesn't own many high-yield dividend stocks, but Chevron is one of the few. Its forward dividend yield is a little shy of 4.1%. Chevron has increased its dividend for 37 consecutive years.\nBuffett hasn't bought additional shares of any of these top five dividend stocks lately. However, I think two are good picks for investors right now.\nFirst, Apple could be poised for strong growth soon. The company's new generative AI capabilities only work on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and newer models. There's a good chance, in my view, that a multi-year surge of iPhone upgrades could be on the way as customers buy new smartphones to take advantage of the artificial intelligence features.\nSecond, Chevron looks like a great choice for income investors. The company's dividend yield and track record of dividend hikes are impressive. I also like Chevron's potential growth opportunities in carbon capture and storage.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), the cross-industry conglomerate led by investing genius Warren Buffett, has long been a fascinating study in investment success. For those fortunate enough to have bought Berkshire stock early, the returns have been nothing short of remarkable.\nHere's a look at how many shares you would own today if you had bought a single share at the company's IPO and eventually converted it into Class B shares, as Berkshire Class A owners can do any time.\nThe company manages two classes of stock: Class A (BRK-A) and Class B (BRK-B). The BRK-B shares were introduced in 1996 to provide an affordable entry point for smaller investors (but the lower-priced shares also come with fewer votes). Each Class A share is convertible into a larger number of Class B shares -- originally 30, but 1,500 stubs nowadays to account for the Class B security's 50-for-1 stock split in 2010.\nImagine you had bought a single BRK-A share when Buffett took control of the struggling textile company in 1965. You then converted it into BRK-B shares when they were introduced and held through the 50-for-1 split in 2010. You would have:\nInitial purchase: 1 BRK-A share\nConversion in 1996: 1 BRK-A share converted to 30 BRK-B shares\n2010 stock split: 30 BRK-B shares split 50-for-1, resulting in 1,500 BRK-B shares.\nThe end result would have been the same if you had held that first share longer and converted it after the Class B split. Either way, you'd have 1,500 Class B shares today.\nOr you could have held on to that original stub, watching it rise from about $20 in 1965 to $657,600 today. This strategy would greatly increase your voting power, though the money-making returns would be nearly identical.\nEither way, you'd enjoy a 3.3 million percent return on your investment, or a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.3% over 59 years. There's financial magic in robust annual returns across several decades of patient ownership.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Fatima Gulzar ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 9 Best Financial Services Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) stands against the other financial services stocks.\nAlthough there was significant turbulence in the financial markets in August, the state of global financing is still stable. Despite considerable falls in the equities and corporate debt markets, financing conditions have not tightened significantly, suggesting borrowing resilience.\nHowever, following an almost 10% drop, the broad US stock market is still 5% below its peak in July. Similar declines have been seen in European stocks, although there has been some recovery in these markets; the 500 large companies market is up 3% from its August low.\nThe markets for corporate bonds have also been impacted. Higher-rated corporate bonds saw an increase in risk premiums, but not to the point where it materially affected borrowing conditions. The current market volatility, according to Chris Jeffrey of Legal & General Investment Management, hasn't affected corporate or household finance conditions significantly. This perspective is supported by the financial conditions index of a major global financial institution, which indicates that while circumstances have tightened since mid-July, they are still historically loose and more accommodating than they were for a large portion of the prior year.\nAmidst the financial turbulence, the financial services industry has faced challenges, but it also showed resilience. The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive. As we have mentioned in our article, \u201c25 Biggest Financial Firms in the World,\u201d the financial services industry is expected to rise at a CAGR of 7.7% over the next few years, from $31138.82 billion in 2023 to $33539.52 billion in 2024. In 2023, Western Europe accounted for the largest portion of the financial services market, with North America coming in second. Financial services are transforming as a result of generative AI, which presents chances for creativity and efficiency.\nThe McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) claims that banks are racing to implement Gen AI and that its full potential can be realized with the correct operational model in place. According to MGI, the use of Gen AI in the global banking market has the potential to generate value of $200 billion to $340 billion per year, or 2.8 to 4.7 percent of industry revenues, primarily through increased productivity. A new study by MGI examined the usage of Gen AI by 16 of the largest financial institutions in the US and Europe, which together manage assets worth close to $26 trillion. According to the study, more than half of the organizations examined have embraced a more centrally driven structure for next-generation AI, even if their current data and analytics architecture is relatively decentralized. Moreover, artificial intelligence, according to EY, is changing financial markets by improving risk management and enhancing customer experience due to its wide range of uses.\nThe RSM US's Financial Services Industry Outlook 2024, also notes that the financial services market is quickly evolving, with a focus on responsible AI in insurance. Similar actions are being taken by states as well. For instance, insurance companies are required by the California Consumer Privacy Act to explain how AI is used in pricing and coverage decisions; violation carries hefty fines. Secondly, the number of retail-friendly investment products is also increasing. Retail investors are the focus of growing interest from asset managers, exchanges, and broker-dealers. Finally, the real exposure of financial institutions to CRE maturities is another trend in the financial services industry. Hence, financial institutions analyzing CRE-related risk should conduct a thorough credit risk evaluation.\nWe sifted through holdings of financial services ETFs and financial media to form an initial list of 20 financial services stocks. Then we selected the 9 stocks that had the highest upside potential. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the upside potential.\nSome big shots in the financial services industry have been left out owing to our methodology since they had negative consensus upside.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\nA team of insurance professionals in a boardroom overlooking a city skyline.\nAnalysts\u2019 Upside Potential: 6.84%\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.B) operates globally in the insurance, freight rail transportation, and utility areas through its subsidiaries. In addition to operating railroad systems throughout North America, the company offers property, casualty, life, accident, and health insurance as well as reinsurance.\nInsurance is the firm's primary business segment, which is managed by Geico, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group, respectively.\nBerkshire Hathaway's record $276.9 billion cash pile and robust 15.5% growth YoY in operational earnings in the second quarter of 2024 highlight the company's flexibility and sound financial standing. The company's various operations demonstrate resilience, including GEICO's strong insurance performance.\nThe pre-tax underwriting earnings of Berkshire and its auto insurance, GEICO, grew dramatically year over year. In the second quarter of 2024, the conglomerate announced an 82% year-over-year growth in net underwriting earnings across its insurance and reinsurance companies, totaling $2.3 billion, exhibiting decreased frequency of claims, increased average premiums per auto policy, and improved operational efficiency.\nHowever, GEICO's policies in force are declining, and the company is repurchasing shares at a slower rate, which may indicate strategic uncertainty or other possible flaws that might impact its business in the future.\nIn Q2 2024, Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.B) 13F stock portfolio value dropped to around $280 billion from approximately $332 billion in Q1 2024. The top five holdings, which make up around 73% of Berkshire\u2019s portfolio, are Chevron, American Express, Apple Inc., Bank of America, and Coca-Cola.\nAnalyst Edward Jones' James Shanahan said in a research note:\n\"BRK shares have significantly outperformed financial services peers during 2023, supported by a relatively strong earnings outlook. We continue to expect solid earnings from BRK's diverse group of operating companies. In our view, however, the current share price reflects these positives,\"\nThe large cash reserves that come particularly from the aforementioned segments give plenty of room for future investments or calculated risks, and it is currently yielding competitive returns due to rising rates. Moreover, Berkshire's consistently high-profit performance and systematic share repurchase policy point to continued solid foundations.\nHence, it is one of the Best Financial Services Stocks to Buy Now. Analysts are bullish on the stock. The average target price set by analysts is $134.58, which is a 6.84% \u00a0increase from the current stock price of $440.84.\nOverall BRK ranks 9th on our list of the best financial services stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of BRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n Disclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett is one of the smartest investors around and has been for decades. As CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), Buffett offers tons of investment advice and commentary in his annual letters to shareholders and at the conglomerate's annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.\nBuffett's advice tends to be straightforward, but one topic that he can sound contradictory on is diversification. He's a staunch advocate of most investors sticking with S&P 500 index funds. He has even directed the executor of his estate to invest 90% of the money he leaves to his wife in an S&P 500 index fund after he passes. Such funds offer a diverse portfolio of stocks representing numerous industries.\nAnd yet, Berkshire Hathaway's $312 billion investment portfolio is heavily concentrated in just a few stocks. Its top three holdings account for nearly 53% of the portfolio's value. On that point, Buffett makes a great analogy: \"If you have LeBron James on your team, don't take him out of the game just to make room for someone else. ... It's crazy to put money into your 20th choice rather than your first choice.\"\nHere are Buffett's top three choices right now, which combined account for the majority of Berkshire's investment portfolio.\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has long been one of Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity holdings. Not only did Buffett spend an estimated $37 billion acquiring a stake in Apple from 2016 through 2018, but the stock has appreciated greatly since then.\nAt one point, it accounted for more than 50% of Berkshire's equity portfolio. Buffett called Apple \"a better business than any we own,\" referencing Berkshire's portfolio of wholly owned companies like Geico and See's Candies. Recently, Buffett trimmed the position over the last three quarters, including a massive sale of nearly half of Berkshire's remaining stake in the second quarter. Still, Apple remains Berkshire's largest equity holding by far, and Buffett expects it to remain the largest position in its portfolio for the foreseeable future.\nThere's a lot to like about Apple. The company's ecosystem of hardware and services provides stable revenue as customers generally remain extremely loyal to the brand. Its services business provides a nice area of high-margin revenue growth for the business while the stalwart iPhone ensures that cash flow remains high. Significant share buybacks give an additional boost to its earnings per share every year. And when a new growth catalyst comes along, like the potential for a surge in iPhone upgrade rates due to the pending debut of new AI features, it provides a significant bump in earnings.\nAt its current price, the stock trades for around 30 times forward earnings. That's a premium to the S&P 500, but the stock is arguably worth it as significant cash on its balance sheet and robust share buybacks support strong returns for shareholders.\nBuffett, through Berkshire, acquired a substantial stake in American Express (NYSE: AXP) in the mid-1990s, and he hasn't done much with the position since. It's a true buy-and-hold story.\nBuffett pointed to the value of his investment in Amex during his 2022 letter to shareholders. The annual dividends paid on Berkshire's original $1.3 billion total investment in the stock climbed from $41 million in 1995 to $302 million that year. More importantly, the stock has grown in step with Berkshire Hathaway, and even faster over the past year and a half. In his 2023 letter to shareholders, he said Berkshire's share of Amex's earnings from the prior year exceeded the $1.3 billion originally invested two decades ago.\nOn the subject of American Express, he said, the lesson is clear: \"When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays.\" Indeed, Berkshire's Amex position is now worth about $37.5 billion.\nWhat separates American Express from other credit card networks is that it issues the cards as well as manages the payment network. That allows it to retain greater control and capture a greater share of the economics of card transactions. That business has treated it extremely well as more and more transactions move from cash to digital payment tools like credit cards. Amex is quickly expanding its network, particularly internationally, where it lags behind its largest rivals, enhancing the network effect of the business.\nMore recently, Amex has turned to lending as a growth opportunity. Historically, it required charge card balances to be paid in full every month, but now, some of its cards permit users to carry a balance. Its net interest income grew 20% year over year in the second quarter, accounting for 23% of net revenue.\nIt has also driven revenue growth by increasing its card fees, while still maintaining its popularity with high-value, high-income consumers. That provides additional protection for Amex against economic slowdowns relative to other card issuers and payment networks.\nShares currently trade near an all-time high, but with a forward P/E ratio of 19, the stock still presents good value.\nAnother financial stock sitting near the top of Buffett's roster of all-stars, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) was a more recent addition to the portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway first acquired preferred shares in the bank in 2011, plowing $5 billion into it -- a highly public vote of confidence in the bank at a time when investor sentiment toward it had soured in the wake of the mortgage crisis. Along with the 5% dividend paid by the preferred shares, Buffett received warrants to buy 700 million shares of BofA's common stock anytime over the next decade for $7.14 each.\nIn 2017, Buffett exercised those warrants because Bank of America raised its quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share, meaning that Berkshire could get more in dividends from the common stock than the preferred shares. So he sold the preferred stock to cover his common stock purchase. Buffett went on to add to the position over the next few years.\nRecently though, Berkshire trimmed about 12% of its stake in BofA. The reason was likely the same as the one behind the Apple stock sale. Berkshire currently benefits from favorable corporate tax policies that are set to expire at the end of 2025. It's sitting on massive gains from its common stock shares of BofA, which currently trade around $38.50.\nBank of America struggled during 2022 and 2023 as the Federal Reserve hiked benchmark U.S. interest rates to curb surging inflation. It held a relatively high amount of long-duration bonds on its balance sheet that lost value on paper as those interest rates climbed. That led to a decline in BofA's net interest income as it had to pay higher interest rates on customers' deposits while collecting lower interest rates from pre-2022 bonds. But the worst appears to be behind BofA as interest rate cuts appear to be on the horizon. Management believes that its net interest income reached the bottom of its trough in the second quarter.\nShares currently trade for 1.5 times tangible book value, which is a fair price to pay even as earnings remain under pressure from interest rates. While Buffett sold some Bank of America shares recently, a 12% cut in Berkshire's stake shouldn't be viewed as signaling that anything is wrong with the business.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Edwin Roman    \u00b7 Producer, Writer",
        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A) is placing a bet on Ulta Beauty (ULTA).\nOn Wednesday, the Warren Buffett-led conglomerate revealed in a regulatory filing that it bought 690,106 shares in the beauty retailer in the second quarter, worth roughly $266 million as of the end of June. Ulta stock jumped over 11% on Thursday and continued to rally on Friday, up 14.6% since Berkshire disclosed its holdings.\nThe move is \"a big stamp of approval,\" BMO Capital Markets managing director and senior analyst Simeon Siegel told Yahoo Finance. \"The beauty category has always been an attractive category.\"\nIn addition to taking a stake in Ulta, Berkshire Hathaway added aerospace manufacturing company Heico (HEI) to its holdings and exited its positions in Snowflake (SNOW) and Paramount (PARA). Berkshire also trimmed shares of Apple (AAPL), among other names.\nHowever, Berkshire's stake in Ulta came as a surprise. The stock has had a tough year so far, though, which may have made it more attractive, in line with Buffett's value-oriented investment philosophy. Shares of the retailer are down 23% since the beginning of the year.\n\u201cWarren Buffett is almost like the original value investor, and I think that that\u2019s the way they looked at it,\u201d said Loop Capital Markets managing director Anthony Chukumba, who has a Buy rating on Ulta stock. \"We do like the fact that Berkshire got involved with the stock. It definitely lends credibility to the story.\"\nUlta is one of the largest beauty retailers in the US and is set to expand into Mexico in 2025. In its most recent quarter, the company increased sales by 3.5% year over year to $2.7 billion, continuing a trend of strong growth and overall resilience in the beauty industry.\nHowever, on April 2, Ulta Beauty CEO Dave Kimbell warned investors of \"a slowdown in the total category across price points and segments.\"\nThat spurred a sell-off in the stock, reflecting investors' fears about a downturn in sales and increased competition from Sephora and Amazon (AMZN), particularly in the higher-end beauty segment.\nAccording to Chukumba, those concerns seem \"overblown.\"\n\"Ulta has a great model,\" he continued. \"They have a completely debt-free balance sheet.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs' Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks: Top 20 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against Goldman Sachs' other hedge fund stock picks.\nThe close of August has marked a highly awaited paradigm shift on Wall Street that investors have been wishing for months. This shift comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally admitted that the time for interest rate cuts had come. Investors rejoiced and the flagship S&P index gained 1.15% while the Dow's blue chip stock index added 1.14% to its value.\nBefore the Fed chair's remarks, investment bank Goldman Sachs had already taken a detailed look at the implications of interest rate cuts on the stock market. In a podcast, the bank's trading strategy head Josh Schiffrin started by explaining that the prospect of the Fed reducing rates was linked \"very closely to the performance of short-term bonds.\" He however added that it's \"really been bonds that have been responsive, where the story has been quite clear,\" pointing out that \"the stock market has been range bound and choppy with a fair amount of rotation between different sectors\" which leads to index level moves being \"muted.\" This makes sense when we consider the Dow and S&P's movements following Powell's latest comments, as the one percentage point gain for each indicated that investors were well prepared for rate cuts even before the Fed Chair took the stand.\nSpeaking of the flagship S&P index, GS' head of American Equity Sales Trading John Flood shared some insights at the June close. Starting off by highlighting the drives of the index's performance during the first half of the year, Flood outlined that when it came to hedge funds, artificial intelligence and GLP-1 were the two key trends that had driven index returns. He described it as \"a long momentum trade\" with \"both cohorts\" of the hedge fund side, namely the \"systemic and fundamental long-short\" fully involved in trading.\nThe Goldman equity head also added that retail investors were finally back as well, and they were focused on \"focused on the ten biggest stocks in the world.\" You can see which companies these might be by reading 20 Largest Companies in the World by Market Cap in 2024. One key concern among investors and analysts alike this year has been a bifurcation in market returns that has seen only the best performers yield most of the rewards. This was also on the mind of analysts from another well known Wall Street bank, who added that it created an opportunity for further profits. Flood shared that while five stocks accounted for \"60% of S&P 500's return year to date,\" this sharp divide did not make him uncomfortable.\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\nThe investor flood of optimism surrounding AI, which has pushed the shares of the top AI GPU designer in the world to post an unbelievable 321,150% in all time returns, has also led to worries that the market might be witnessing another period akin to the ill fated dotcom era of the 1990s. When asked whether this period reminded him of that time, Flood replied that his firm felt \"a little bit more like 1995 than 1999. And 1995 clearly was a very positive year for the stock market and a positive run,\" particularly since \"valuations and earnings from market leaders are way friendlier today than they were in 1999.\" Concluding by sharing that he felt \"very bullish\" the analyst also forecast his estimate for the flagship S&P. His estimate? Well, Flood believes that \"you could see S&P 500 trade well north of 6,000 this year as the biggest get bigger and we continue to just see a little bit of a news vacuum into the elections right now.\"\nThe bit about market bifurcation between big and small companies was also on the mind of GS' senior US portfolio strategist Ben Snider. He commented on the jump in small cap stocks in July when they gained as much as 2% while other indexes lost up to 1.98% due to investors positioning themselves for potential interest rate cuts. Snider explained that small cap stocks tend to take on more debt, and lower rates coupled with their lower market values lead to big gains. According to him \"if just 1% of assets comes out of the S&P 500 and flows into, for example, the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index, that 1% of S&P 500 market cap would represent more than 15% of Russell 2000 market cap.\" Coming back to AI, the Goldman strategist has a tip for those who might be worried that the hype surrounding AI might be more than the technology's ability to generate money for the firms that plan to plow a trillion dollars into it. He shared that as opposed to the market cap weighted benchmark S&P, it might be prudent to invest in the equal weight variant \"if you are concerned about the degree of concentration or AI investment.\"\nSpeaking of AI, GS was also out with a detailed report in July which analyzed the year to date returns of different AI sectors. The AI stack, broadly speaking, is made up of four categories of firms. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid and moving upwards, these are chip manufacturers and designers, those that provide AI capacity like server farms, firms that sell AI products, and finally, companies that will see the largest gains from the ubiquitous or near ubiquitous adaptation of AI. As per GS, the year to date returns of these four sectors as of late July were 139% (represented only by the top AI GPU stock), 22%, -2%, and 2% respectively. One of the strongest performers within the AI infrastructure segment is utilities, and there's further room ahead as analyst Ryan Hammond believes that \"after adjusting valuations for the improvement in long- term EPS growth expectations that the sector has experienced, Utilities\u2019 PEG (P/E to long term growth (LTG)) ratio is 2x, well below the historical average of 3x.\"\nSo, with GS taking a broad view of the market, we decided to see which hedge fund stocks the bank is a fan of.\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs' top hedge fund stocks, we ranked the bank's list of stocks with the number of hedge funds that, according to its data, had the stock as a top ten holding.\nWe also mentioned the total number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks as per Insider Monkey's data. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of insurance professionals in a boardroom overlooking a city skyline.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 120\nGS' Number Of Funds: 17\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is the world's biggest investment holding company. Run by Warren Buffett, while the firm is known for its sharp stock picking ability, the largest chunk of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)'s revenue comes from insurance. As of the second quarter, $26 billion of the firm's $93 billion in revenue was from insurance. However, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is a well diversified business that has a significant presence in renewable energy, railroads, fuel marketing, energy, industrial and construction products manufacturing, and aviation services. This offers the firm a wide moat as it is able to capitalize on a host of different sectors that are dependent on economic performance. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) also has one of the biggest balance sheets in the world, which is evident through its $36 billion in cash and $234 billion in short term investments. This not only creates additional avenues of growth for the firm but also protects it against any untoward event that might affect its business.\nThe London Company mentioned Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\"Insurance was once again a bright spot in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B)'s 4Q earnings; GEICO showed meaningful margin improvement. The company once again sold some securities in the quarter, resulting in near all-time highs in the balance of cash & short-term investments. Overall, we continue to appreciate BRK.B for their financial strength, investment acumen, and disciplined management.\"\nOverall BRK-B ranks 13th on our list of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of BRK-B as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Reuben Gregg Brewer, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) is one of the most storied stocks on Wall Street. It has minted a large number of millionaires over time. However, buying today may not be the best option if you hope that it will make you a millionaire, too. But don't write the stock off -- CEO Warren Buffett looks like he is getting ready to make some big moves when the time is right.\nBerkshire Hathaway would not exist today if it weren't for the very unique investment approach taken by longtime CEO Warren Buffett. To summarize his methods as simply as possible, he prefers to buy well-run companies while they are out of favor for some reason. This requires patience and access to investment capital. (Keep those two things in mind as you continue reading.) Over time, he has built a complex and shockingly diversified conglomerate.\nToday, the S&P 500 index is trading near its highest levels in history. That means that companies are, generally speaking, priced very highly in the current environment. It is hard to find good companies \"on the cheap\" to buy right now. That's why Buffett warned in the company's 2023 annual report:\nThere remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can value; some we can't. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced. Outside the U.S., there are essentially no candidates that are meaningful options for capital deployment at Berkshire. All in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance.\nRe-read the last sentence: \"All in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance.\" Buffett is basically warning investors that this is not a millionaire-maker stock right now. However, given Buffett's investment approach, that's not exactly surprising, either.\nInvestors shouldn't assume, however, that Berkshire Hathaway will never be a millionaire-maker again. The company's vast size is an impediment, since it needs to make big deals to move the needle. However, at the end of 2023, Berkshire had over $163 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. By the end of the first quarter of 2024, that figure had grown to over $182 billion. And at the end of the second quarter, it was over $271 billion.\nNotably, the headlines have been filled with news about Buffett selling appreciated stocks, such as Apple\u00a0and, to a lesser extend, Bank of America. With regard to Apple, Buffett reduced his stake by around 50%, so it was a huge move. Bank of America was \"just\" a change of a couple of billion dollars. Still, a lot of the cash raised from these sales is likely to find its way onto the balance sheet.\nThis is where things get interesting, because Buffett has a habit of sitting on cash until he finds something he believes is worth buying. And he often acts while other investors are fearful, like during big market sell-offs (he invested in Bank of America during the Great Recession, for example). The fact that he's building up a cash hoard while the stock market is near all-time highs is likely setting him up to make a sizable move when the next bear market rolls around.\nIf you want to own Berkshire Hathaway, hoping it can help make you a millionaire like it has so many others, you'll want to sit tight on the sidelines right now. Buffett himself is telling investors as much. However, he also appears to be gearing up for a time when there are more opportunities to invest. That will probably be a hard time to invest, because Wall Street will be in disarray and babies will be getting tossed out with the bathwater.\nBut if you can think like a contrarian, that's when Berkshire Hathaway will likely have the greatest opportunity to get you to seven figures. First, the stock will likely be cheaper and, second, that's when Berkshire Hathaway will have the best opportunity to put its cash hoard to work.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Warren Buffett\u2019s portfolio: Here are the stocks Berkshire Hathaway is buying or selling",
        "Author": "  Brian Baker, CFA ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett is arguably the world\u2019s most famous investor, and his investment moves are closely followed. Each quarter, the company he runs, Berkshire Hathaway, discloses its current holdings to shareholders.\nHere are some of the changes Buffett and his two investment officers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, made during the second quarter, according to the latest 13F regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The holdings are reported as of June 30, 2024.\nUlta Beauty caught Berkshire\u2019s eye in the most recent quarter, and the conglomerate opened a position in the purveyor of beauty products, albeit a relatively small 690,000 shares. The value of that position came to about $266 million as of June 30.\nHEICO is another new position for Berkshire this quarter, with just over a million shares added to Berkshire\u2019s stable. This maker of industrial parts has been a long-term winner, and Berkshire\u2019s new stake comes to more than $185 million as of June 30.\nIn the second quarter, Berkshire added a further 4.3 percent to its recently disclosed stake in insurance giant Chubb. Berkshire revealed a new $6.7 billion stake in the first quarter, but actually first established the position in the third quarter of 2023.\u00a0 Berkshire had received confidential treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission for the position so it didn\u2019t have to disclose it when it was still accumulating the stake.\nBerkshire continued to add to its position in Liberty Sirius XM Series A and C shares during the second quarter. It boosted its position in the A shares by more than 7 percent and the C shares by nearly 7 percent. The combined stake was worth about $2.3 billion at the end of June.\nBerkshire also added slightly to its stake in Occidental Petroleum during the second quarter. Berkshire boosted its position by nearly 3 percent and held more than 255 million shares worth $16.1 billion at the end of June.\nBerkshire sharply increased its relatively small position in satellite radio leader Sirius XM, boosting that stake about 262 percent, to a total of nearly 133 million shares. The shares were worth about $376 million at the end of the second quarter. Just last quarter, Sirius had cut its stake in the company by 9 percent.\nBuffett and company sharply pared their stake in Apple, Berkshire\u2019s largest holding, reducing it more than 49 percent during the second quarter. Berkshire sold about 389 million shares and now holds exactly 400 million shares worth more than $84 billion at the end of June. Buffett told shareholders at the Berkshire annual meeting that he expected Apple to be a top holding for years, but he was not afraid to trim as the market for tech ran hot through the first half of the year.\nBerkshire also reduced its position in Capital One Financial, cutting that some 21 percent, to about 9.8 million shares. The stake was valued at more than $1.3 billion as of June 30.\nTelecom player T-Mobile US was also trimmed in the second quarter, with Berkshire reducing that stake by nearly 11 percent. The conglomerate still owns nearly 4.7 million shares worth more than $823 million as of the second quarter.\nBerkshire closed out its stake in Paramount Global during the second quarter, after slashing it by more than 88 percent in the first quarter. The position was established during the first quarter of 2022 and Buffett took responsibility for the mistake, saying Berkshire had lost a lot of money on it.\nBerkshire completely cleared out its stake in Snowflake, a cloud company and artificial intelligence (AI) play, in the second quarter. It sold off more than 6.1 million shares.\nBuffett and company also reduced Berkshire\u2019s existing position in energy giant Chevron, one of Berkshire\u2019s largest holdings, by about 3.6 percent. Berkshire now holds about 119 million shares worth $18.6 billion at the end of the second quarter.\nBerkshire reduced its stake in Louisiana-Pacific Corp. by about 10 percent during the second quarter, following a reduction of around 6 percent in the first quarter. It held nearly 6 million shares worth about $491.1 million at the end of June. The position was first established in the third quarter of 2022.\nFloor & Decor also found itself on the Berkshire chopping block, with Buffett et al. cutting the position by nearly 17 percent, to just below 4 million shares. The position in the specialty retailer is worth $395 million as of June 30.\nBerkshire also trimmed its holdings in Liberty Live, both the A and C series of the media company. The C series was reduced by 1.9 percent, while the A series was cut by 1.3 percent. The combined position was worth about $605 million as of the end of June.\nBerkshire takes a concentrated approach with its investments, typically holding the majority of its portfolio in just a few companies. Its largest holdings at the end of the second quarter accounted for about 73 percent of the portfolio\u2019s value, and included these top five positions (valuations as of June 30, 2024):\nApple (AAPL) \u2013 $84.2 billion\nBank of America (BAC) \u2013 $41.1 billion\nAmerican Express (AXP) \u2013 $35.1 billion\nCoca-Cola (KO) \u2013 $25.5 billion\nChevron (CVX) \u2013 $18.6 billion\nBuffett spent about $345 million repurchasing Berkshire stock in the second quarter of 2024, following up an earlier repurchase of about $2.6 billion in the first quarter. This is an indication that he believes the shares are undervalued and continuing shareholders will benefit from the buybacks.\nBuffett and Berkshire have an excellent track record in selecting investments, but be sure to research any investments thoroughly before investing yourself. Even stocks owned by legendary investors decline and you\u2019ll need to understand the businesses you\u2019re invested in well enough to make a buy, hold or sell decision on your own.\nRelated: 8 of the best Warren Buffett quotes of all time\u00a0\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision.

        "Title": "Will Berkshire Hathaway Reach a Trillion-Dollar Market Cap in 2025?",
        "Author": "  Matt Frankel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "As of this writing, there are five U.S.-listed stocks in the trillion-dollar club, and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) isn't one of them -- not yet anyway. The Warren Buffett-led conglomerate has a market cap of $926 billion as of Aug. 8, making it the sixth-largest publicly traded company.\nAt its all-time high reached in June, Berkshire was in the elusive trillion-dollar club, with a market cap of about $1.06 trillion. But the share price has since pulled back a bit, mainly on macroeconomic worries.\nWith that in mind, can Berkshire surpass a trillion-dollar market cap again within the next year or so? Here are some potential catalysts -- both positive and negative -- that could determine its future trajectory.\nBerkshire Hathaway's operation has three main parts: its operating businesses, stock portfolio, and cash. So, let's take these one at a time.\nBerkshire's stock portfolio is the most straightforward potential catalyst. It currently has a market value of $304 billion (33% of Berkshire's total market cap), and strong stock performance could potentially add tens of billions of dollars to Berkshire's valuation.\nBerkshire's $277 billion in cash and short-term investments is more of a wildcard. It currently generates about $14 billion in annual interest income for the company, but if Buffett and his team find a smart way to put a lot of it to work (an attractive acquisition opportunity, for example), it could help drive the stock higher.\nThe operating businesses have been performing well, with operating earnings climbing 15% year over year in the second quarter. If the company can produce similar growth as we head into 2025, it could be a big catalyst for the stock.\nOn the other hand, there are several potential catalysts that could cause the stock to stay under the trillion-dollar threshold or even move lower.\nThe obvious example is if a recession hits. While most of Berkshire's operating businesses are fairly recession-proof (people still pay their electric bills and auto insurance in bad economies), not all of them are. A recession could adversely affect many of the holdings in Berkshire's stock portfolio.\nFalling interest rates are also worth mentioning, as they can be a mixed bag. While lower rates would likely be a positive catalyst for many of Berkshire's investments, it's also worth noting that Berkshire has more than $230 billion in short-term Treasury securities, which are paying Berkshire an annualized yield of about 5%. If rates fall by two percentage points by the end of 2025, which is the consensus estimate right now, it could cost Berkshire several billion dollars in annual interest income.\nThere are plenty of others. But the point is that there is plenty that could go wrong.\nNobody has a crystal ball that can tell us what Berkshire will do, but mathematically, it is quite likely that the stock will achieve a trillion-dollar market cap within the next year or so. For one thing, doing so would require a roughly 8% gain in Berkshire's share price, which is well below the company's long-term average and even below the long-term average return of the S&P 500. In this sense, it would be somewhat disappointing if Berkshire only reached a $1 trillion market cap by the end of 2025.\nOn the other hand, as we've seen, plenty of factors outside Berkshire's control, such as the possibility of a recession, could stand in its way. But with that in mind, I'd say that there's a greater than 50/50 probability that Berkshire will rejoin the trillion-dollar club before the end of 2025.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\nAnother factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Berkshire Hathaway B (BRK.B) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to BRK.B for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Berkshire Hathaway B's main business drivers.\nFounded in 1889, Berkshire Hathaway is an Omaha, NE-based holding company, which owns more than 90 subsidiaries in insurance, rail roads, utilities, manufacturing services, retail and home building.The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both a primary basis and insurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation and distribution businesses.\nIt has four major operating sectors - The Insurance group includes (26% of 2023 revenue) : GEICO, Government Employees Insurance Company writes private passenger automobile insurance; General Re conducts reinsurance business, offering property and casualty, life and health coverage to clients worldwide; Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group underwrites excess-of-loss reinsurance and quota-share coverage for insurers and reinsurers globally; Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group comprises a wide variety of independently-managed insurance businesses that principally write liability coverage for commercial accounts.\nThe Railroad business includes MidAmerican and BNSF operations (6.3%), which provides railway services through Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp.\nThe Utilities and Energy businesses (22%) that includes Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Pilot Travel Centers.\nThe Manufacturing, Service & Retailing Operations includes (45.7%): Manufacturing \u2013 Acme Building Brands, Benjamin Moore, H.H. Brown Shoe Group, CTB, Fechheimer Brothers, Forest River, Fruit of the Loom, Garan, ISCAR, Johns Manville, Justin Brands, Larson-Juhl, MiTek, Russell, Scott Fetzer, Vanity Fair, Richline Group and Albecca. The Service sub-segment includes \u2013 Buffalo News, Business Wire, FlightSafety, International Dairy Queen, Pampered Chef, and NetJets.\nRetailing sub-segment includes \u2013 Ben Fridge Jeweler, Borsheim\u2019s, Helzberg Diamond Shops, Jordan\u2019s Furniture, Nebraska Furniture Mart, See\u2019s Candies, Star Furniture, R.C. Willey and TTI Inc. Others include \u2013 Marmon Group, McLane Company and Shaw Industries.\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Berkshire Hathaway B a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nA $1000 investment made in August 2014 would be worth $3,413.34, or a gain of 241.33%, as of August 29, 2024, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\nCompare this to the S&P 500's rally of 180.07% and gold's return of 86.90% over the same time frame.\nAnalysts are forecasting more upside for BRK.B too.\nBerkshire is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility. Continued insurance business growth fuels an increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The addition of Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) has strengthened its energy business. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus. Shares of Berkshire have outperformed the industry year to date. However, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility and also affects underwriting results. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind. With the demise of Charles Munger, uncertainty looms over the company's performance.\nThe stock is up 5.95% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 2 higher, for fiscal 2024. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "Author": "  Jonathan Stempel ",
        "Text": "By Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) -Berkshire Hathaway's market value closed above $1 trillion for the first time on Wednesday, reflecting investor confidence in the conglomerate that Warren Buffett built over nearly six decades into what many consider a proxy for the American economy.\nBuffett's company joined six other U.S. companies, all in or tied to the technology sector, valued at more than $1 trillion: Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon.com and Facebook parent Meta Platforms.\nBerkshire's Class A shares closed up 0.7% at $696,502.02. The more widely held Class B shares rose 0.9% to $464.59.\nBuffett, who turns 94 on Friday, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire since 1965.\nHe transformed it from a failing textile company into a colossus with dozens of old-economy businesses such as Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Brooks running shoes, Dairy Queen ice cream, Ginsu knives and the World Book encyclopedia.\nThe operating businesses generated $22.8 billion of profit in the year's first half, up 26% from 2023.\nBerkshire also has a huge stock portfolio even after selling tens of billions of dollars of Apple and Bank of America, its largest and until recently its second-largest stock holdings, in 2024.\nThe sales are a major reason Berkshire's cash hoard, mainly in U.S. Treasury bills, soared to $276.9 billion as of June 30. Berkshire has also slowed repurchases of its own stock.\n\"Buffett built Berkshire in a systematic, relatively low risk manner,\" said Steve Check, president of Check Capital Management in Costa Mesa, California, which invests one-third of its $2 billion of assets in Berkshire stock and options. \"As a huge conglomerate it will always have parts doing well.\"\nThe $1 trillion valuation is based on Berkshire's 553,234 Class A and 1,325,192,508 Class B shares outstanding as of July 23.\nSince the year Buffett took charge, Berkshire shares have gained more than 5,600,000%.\nThat's about 20% annually, nearly double the annualized gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 including dividends.\nNo single catalyst appeared to fuel Wednesday's gain. Berkshire's Class A shares are up 28% this year, while the S&P 500 excluding dividends is up 17%.\nBuffett still owns more than 14% of Berkshire despite having donated more than half his shares to charity since 2006.\nHis $146 billion fortune makes him the world's sixth-richest person, Forbes magazine said on Wednesday.\nCheck said he became a grandfather on Aug. 16, and bought 100 Berkshire Class B shares for his grandson Zealand that day.\n\"Investors should certainly not jump in because the market cap hit $1 trillion, and the stock is perhaps as fully priced as it has been since before the 2008 financial crisis,\" he said. \"It is a good investment for someone with a 10-year horizon.\"\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York, Editing by Franklin Paul, Nick Zieminski and Cynthia Osterman)\n"

        "Title": "Berkshire Hathaway Stock (NYSE:BRK.B): Don\u2019t Panic Following Halving of Apple Stake",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett\u2019s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK.B) may have shocked some over the weekend when it was disclosed that it had cut its massive Apple (AAPL) stake in half as it released its latest round of quarterly earnings results. With a massive cash mountain that\u2019s since grown to be even more towering, there are many unanswered questions when it comes to Berkshire, Apple, and the road ahead. Despite the giant question marks, I remain bullish on Berkshire Hathaway stock.\nAs you\u2019d expect, the news sent shares of Berkshire and Apple nosediving on Monday (down 3.4% and 4.8%, respectively), a move exacerbated by Monday\u2019s blow-up in the Japanese stock market. Despite the volatility spike, investors likely have nothing to panic over as Berkshire raises more cash that it\u2019ll likely deploy once it finally sees better opportunities.\nBerkshire\u2019s swelling cash pile (currently at a record $277 billion) and continued prudence make shares an even better defensive bet, in my humble opinion. To some, Berkshire\u2019s record pile of cash is a \u201cproblem.\u201d Sure, not being able to find opportunities to score a solid return relative to the risk is a problem.\nHowever, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d agree that it\u2019s far less of a problem than being caught fully invested in the face of a painful stock market correction or crash without enough dry powder to take advantage of the bargains to be had on the way down.\nIn any case, Berkshire already had ample financial firepower before it sold off its latest chunk of AAPL shares. Further, some investors may be inclined to wonder if the magnitude of the recent Apple share sale is a red flag that the broader stock market is looking at a serious drawdown going into year\u2019s end. Though it\u2019s impossible to tell what Buffett is thinking in real-time, I think many investors are overreacting (maybe even panicking) in the heat of the moment.\nThe latest slate of tech earnings has been worrisome, as has negative momentum in the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) and the latest wave of fear rippling from Japan. And while the latest round of AAPL stock selling may be far more sizeable than many may have expected, the Oracle of Omaha already had a chance to address the Apple questions during Berkshire\u2019s 2024 shareholder meeting.\nWarren Buffett (and the late Charlie Munger) have had nothing but good things to say about the iPhone maker. Heck, at the latest Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting, Buffett went as far as to say that Apple \u201cis an even better business\u201d than some of the other \u201cwonderful\u201d holdings in the Berkshire stock portfolio, as Apple CEO Tim Cook watched the meeting from special seats close to the front.\nThough the latest round of selling is a heck of a lot larger than the first sale made earlier this year (back then, Berkshire trimmed just 13% of its Apple stake), investors probably shouldn\u2019t treat the paring as a sign that Apple is no longer a wonderful business. They shouldn\u2019t assume that its Apple Intelligence product will fail to hit the mark or that the market is dancing on a knife\u2019s edge. In fact, Buffett mentioned tax considerations as a reason for taking profits on a portion of Berkshire\u2019s Apple stake.\nSome may be inclined to think it\u2019s more than just taxes, given how massive the latest round of selling has been. However, I\u2019d argue that the taxation reasoning still makes sense.\nWith recent chatter from the Biden administration pointing to the potential for capital gains taxes to go up in the U.S. (to a proposed 44.6% rate, which is even higher than Canada\u2019s recent hike to 33%) for the wealthy, taking profits well ahead of time seems smart. Should Kamala Harris win the U.S. presidential election, the window to book gains at the old rate may close, perhaps sooner than expected.\nIn any case, there\u2019s nothing stopping Berkshire from having their cake and eating it, too, by selling Apple here and buying back at a later date. By selling before any capital gains tax hike has a remote chance of happening, Buffett won\u2019t have to risk taking as large a hit to the chin by selling later.\nFurther, nothing is stopping Berkshire from buying back into Apple at a later date, perhaps after the stock trades at more reasonable valuations. After the Apple Intelligence-driven rally, AAPL stock traded at close to 34 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), the highest the multiple had been in recent memory. Indeed, Apple had become historically expensive, as the AI hype drove shares above $230 per share.\nEven with the latest round of selling, Apple remains the largest holding in the Berkshire stock portfolio, comprising around 28.4% of it at the time of writing. That\u2019s still a massive stake that allows Berkshire to continue riding the firm higher as it moves into the age of generative AI.\nArguably, having one stock comprise nearly 30% of the portfolio is still excessive, given that Berkshire shareholders have expressed their concerns to Buffett at previous shareholder meetings over the company\u2019s heavy concentration in Apple.\nOn TipRanks, BRK.B stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of three analyst ratings, there are two Buys and one Hold recommendation. The average BRK.B stock price target\u00a0is $462.33, implying upside potential of 11.8%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $450.00 per share to a high of $472.00 per share.\nSee more BRK.B analyst ratings\nBerkshire Hathaway may have alarmed some with the magnitude of its latest Apple stake paring. Despite the size of the sales, I view Buffett\u2019s previous taxation explanation as still sound.\nAdditionally, with AAPL stock still trading at the high end of its range, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s only prudent to play with the house\u2019s money at this juncture. Finally, such a big sale also reduces Berkshire\u2019s single-stock risk, something that had been brought up by Berkshire shareholders in the past.\nSo, if you\u2019re not overinvested in Apple, have no shareholders to appease, and won\u2019t be affected by changes to tax policy, I\u2019d argue it makes very little sense to follow Buffett and Berkshire by dumping AAPL stock, especially now that a chunk of the Warren Buffett premium was wiped off AAPL stock during Monday\u2019s session. If you really want to follow Buffett\u2019s style, buying Berkshire stock on the dip seems like a far better idea.\nDisclosure\n"

I love that. The harder to evaluate the better.\nI\u2019ve always viewed Berkshire Hathaway as a sports team in that it\u2019s got lots of different pieces delivering an above-average overall performance. Sometimes one or two of these pieces help keep it moving in the right direction. Like sports teams, no business is moving 100% forward. There are always weaknesses. Diversification helps avoid too many potholes.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nWith that in mind, I\u2019m looking for holding company stocks of all sizes \u2014 I\u2019m not talking about bank holding companies \u2014 that use diversification to their advantage.\nHere are my three choices with one large, medium and small holding company stock.\nSource: Hadrian / Shutterstock\nExor (OTCMKTS:EXXRF) is the largest of the three holding companies with a market cap of 20.86 billion euros ($22.55 billion). It is the holding company of the Agnelli family, the co-founders of Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino, better known as Fiat.\nAlthough the Agnelli\u2019s were growing Fiat and acquiring other company\u2019s long before Exor, it took the creation of IFI International (IFINT) in 1964 to hold its non-Italian businesses for the family\u2019s ambitions outside Italy to take hold.\nIn 1991, IFINT acquired Exor SA, a French holding company, and merged it with IFINT in 1993, to form Exor Group. In the 21st century, the family took its five holding companies and merged them into one \u2014 Exor. The Agnelli family owns 52.6% of its shares.\nExor owns significant ownership positions in many public companies including Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), where it owns 22.9% of the shares and 36.5% of the voting rights, and Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), where it has 14.2% of the shares and 23.2% of the voting rights. Exor also owns several private businesses such as The Economist (34.7% of the shares and 20.0% of the voting rights) and Christian Louboutin (24.0% of the shares and voting rights).\nMost importantly, its net asset value per share has a compound annual growth rate between 2009 and 2023 of 18.6%, 730 basis points higher than the MSCI World Index.\nSource: Hayk_Shalunts / Shutterstock.com\nLoews (NYSE:L) is the second-largest holding company with a market cap of $17.58 billion. The company has come back from a long losing streak in the past year with its shares gaining over 27%.\nNot to be confused with Lowe\u2019s (NYSE:LOW), the home improvement retailer, Loews\u2019 history unofficially dates back to 1946 when Laurence Tisch convinced his parents to buy a New Jersey hotel for $125,000. Ten years later, the Tisch\u2019s built their first Florida hotel. It remains in the hotel business to this day.\nThe current version of Loews has four operating segments: 92% of CNA Financial (NYSE:CNA), wholly-owned subsidiaries Boardwalk Pipeline and Loews Hotels, and 53% of privately held Altium Packaging. In addition, it has $3.1 billion in cash and investments on its balance sheet along with $1.8 billion in debt.\nIts capital allocation is simple. It does three things: Repurchases its shares, invests in the businesses mentioned above and looks for new platform investments to grow beyond the four current businesses.\nIts largest equity investment in the company\u2019s Q2 2024 13F, excluding CNA, is Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI). Loews owns 29.2 million shares, or 8.3% of the total.\nSource: Shutterstock\nBoston Omaha (NYSE:BOC) is the smallest of three holding companies with a $466.2 million market cap.\nI chose BOC because it\u2019s based in Omaha like Berkshire Hathaway. It is named after the two founders\u2019 two hometowns. And one of the founders, Alex B. Rozek, is the grandson of Warren Buffett\u2019s sister, Doris.\nIt has four operating segments: insurance, billboards, broadbank, and asset management. Together they generated revenue of $25.6 million in Q1 2024, up 12.3% from a year earlier.\nIts EBITDA in the trailing 12 months ended March 31 was $19 million on $99 million in revenue. That was good for a 19.2% EBITDA margin.\nRozek left Boston Omaha to pursue other opportunities in May with co-CEO Adam Peterson fully assuming the position\u2019s responsibilities. While their partnership was a good one, sharing the CEO job results in additional expenses and potential conflicts. This can hurt shareholder value.\nAs Peterson states in the 2023 shareholder letter, BOC shares had a CAGR of 14% from early in 2015 to the end of 2022. At the end of 2023, it was down to 5.5%. Also down year-to-date, the stock is lower than at the end of 2023.\nIts combination of operating businesses and minority investments make it an interesting speculative bet for aggressive investors.\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "Text": "Many investors follow Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio of nearly 50 stocks and exchange-traded funds for fresh investment ideas. It's a great starting point because those investments were hand-picked by Warren Buffett, one of the world's most acclaimed investors, and his experienced management team.\nThat's why it was alarming when Berkshire started selling a lot of stocks -- including half of its stake in Apple and all of its shares of HP and Snowflake -- during the past year. Its cash and equivalents also swelled to a record $277 billion at the end of the second quarter, which suggests Buffett is hoarding some dry powder in anticipation of a stock market slump.\nBut Berkshire didn't sell any shares of the card processing giant Visa (NYSE: V) during the past year. It also significantly increased its position in the American-Swiss insurance company Chubb Limited (NYSE: CB). Let's see which one of these resilient financial stocks will generate bigger gains during the next 12 months.\nBerkshire started to buy Visa's stock in the third quarter of 2011. It now holds 8.3 million shares of Visa, and that $2.21 billion stake accounts for 0.7% of its entire portfolio.\nVisa operates one of the world's largest card payment processing networks, but it doesn't issue any credit or debit cards itself. Instead, it relies on banks and financial institutions to partner with the company to issue co-branded cards. Those partners actually hold all the debt and are responsible for collecting payments.\nVisa only makes money by charging merchants swipe fees (usually 1.5% to 3.5%) for each card transaction. It splits those fees with the issuing banks and keeps the rest as revenue. Its rival Mastercard uses the same business model.\nVisa's scale, brand recognition, and customer retention make it an evergreen investment. From fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2023 (ended in September), its revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% as its earnings per share (EPS) grew at a CAGR of 16%. It repurchased more than a fifth of its shares during the past decade.\nYet Visa isn't immune to economic downturns. Inflation throttled consumer spending during the past two years, and a recession could easily curb its growth. It also faces a lot of pressure from antitrust regulators to lower or cap its swipe fees.\nNevertheless, analysts still expect Visa's revenue and earnings to rise 10% and 17%, respectively, in fiscal 2024. Its stock looks reasonably valued at 24 times next year's earnings, but the macro and regulatory issues could hurt its valuations.\nBerkshire started to buy shares of Chubb in the third quarter of 2023. It added more shares during the following three quarters, and it currently holds more than 23 million shares. That $7.37 billion stake accounts for 2.4% of its portfolio.\nIt isn't surprising for Berkshire to invest in one more insurance company. It already owns major insurers like GEICO and Gen Re, and it generated 40% of its operating earnings from its insurance underwriting and investment businesses last year.\nChubb is the world's largest publicly traded provider of property, supplemental health, and casualty insurance. It's based in Switzerland, but it does business in 54 countries and territories while employing about 40,000 people worldwide.\nThe current version of the company was created in 2016 after ACE Limited acquired the original Chubb Corporation and inherited its brand. From 2016 to 2023, Chubb's revenue grew at a CAGR of 7% as its EPS rose at a CAGR of 14%. Its consolidated net premiums increased by double-digit percentages during the past three years, while its core operating income climbed by the double digits during the past two years. It also repurchased 13% of its shares during the past seven years.\nIn the first half of 2024, Chubb's consolidated net premiums and core operating income increased 13% and 16%, respectively. That growth was driven by its rising property and casualty (P&C) underwriting, life insurance, and investment income.\nAnalysts expect Chubb's revenue and adjusted earnings to both grow about 9% for the full year. Those are solid growth rates for a stock that trades at less than 13 times forward earnings, and it faces fewer macro and regulatory headwinds than Visa.\nVisa and Chubb are both reliable long-term investments, but it's easy to see why Berkshire didn't buy more shares of the former and added more shares of the latter. Visa's stock isn't a screaming bargain, and it's more vulnerable to an economic slowdown than Chubb. Chubb's business model is more resistant to economic headwinds, and its stock looks cheaper relative to its growth potential. That's why I believe Chubb has a clear shot at outperforming Visa over the next few quarters.\nBefore you buy stock in Chubb, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chubb wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Brooke DiPalma    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Ulta Beauty's (ULTA) glow-up may be coming to an end.\nOn Thursday after market close, the beauty retailer reported second quarter results that missed estimates across the board. Revenue came in at $2.55 billion, compared to $2.62 billion expected. Earnings per share of $5.30 also fell short of the $5.50 expected.\nCEO Dave Kimbell acknowledged the disappointing results in an earnings call.\n\"We do not believe these results reflect the strong engagement with our brand, the strength of our operating model, or the performance I know we can deliver over the longer term,\" he said.\nHe outlined a few factors weighing on Ulta, including normalizing demand post-pandemic, more value-conscious consumers, and a shift in the marketplace.\n\"There are significantly more places to buy beauty, especially prestige beauty, with more than 1,000 new points of distribution opened in the last three years. As a result, our market share continues to be challenged, particularly within prestige beauty,\" Kimbell said.\nSame-store sales declined 1.2% year over year, a stark contrast to the 8% and 14.4% increases seen in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Ulta now projects same-store sales to fall 2% to 0% for fiscal year 2024, compared to the previous guidance of a 2%-3% jump. It expects revenue to come in between $11.0 billion and $11.2 billion, less than the previous range of $11.5 billion to $11.6 billion.\nKimbell said the team is \"aggressively taking actions\" in five areas: strengthening assortment, expanding social relevance using influencers and creators, enhancing the digital experience, leveraging its loyalty program, and building up its promotional activities.\nShares fell 7% in after-hours trading. The stock has shed roughly 25% since the start of the year and more than 30% in the last six months.\nAnalysts feared these results as consumers are becoming extra mindful about spending while competition is increasing and retail theft remains an issue.\n\"We think beauty demand may come under pressure in 2024 as consumer budgets remain stressed after two years of elevated rates. We think consumers will lean into shopping closer to refill, shopping for innovation-led solutions, and leveraging consumer rewards,\" CFRA analyst Ana Garcia wrote in a note to clients.\nPrior to the results, UBS analyst Michael Lasser predicted that Ulta Beauty would once again lower its 2024 guidance. However, \"ULTA shares are still pricing in too much negativity on the long-term growth and margin prospects for this business,\" he said.\n\"We don't view ULTA's model as broken or structurally disadvantaged.\" Rather, it is \"digesting several years of outsized category growth\" and increased competition, including online players like Amazon and TikTok shops, he added.\nAccording to a report from foot traffic analytics platform Placer.ai, Ulta Beauty is still seeing outsized foot traffic growth compared to the rest of the beauty and wellness industry.\nOn Aug. 14, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) revealed in a regulatory filing that it bought 690,106 Ulta shares in Q2, worth roughly $266 million as of the end of June, Yahoo Finance's Edwin Roman reported.\nAt the time, BMO Capital Markets managing director Simeon Siegel told Yahoo Finance that the move provided \"a big stamp of approval for Ulta Beauty.\"\nUlta's stock is up more than 50% in the past five years, benefiting from a boom in beauty and wellness post-COVID. However, it has underperformed the broader market; the S&P 500 is up more than 90% during the same period.\nHere's what Ulta Beauty reported in Q2, compared to Wall Street expected, per Bloomberg consensus.\nRevenue: $2.55 billion compared to $2.62 billion\nAdjusted earnings per share: $5.30 compared to $5.49\nSame-store sales growth: -1.2% compared to +1.32%\n\u2014\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett doesn't need anyone to advise him on what to do. But with Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) cash stockpile now at nearly $277 billion, it's hard not to speculate about what the legendary investor might do with so much money.\nIf I managed Berkshire's investment portfolio, I know what I'd do with part of that massive treasure chest. Here are two perfect companies for Buffett to buy next.\nIt wouldn't surprise me in the least if Buffett is already seriously considering increasing Berkshire's stake in Chubb (NYSE: CB). A full acquisition of the insurance company would make sense, in my view.\nBuffett began scooping up shares of Chubb last year. However, at the time, outsiders only knew that Berkshire was investing in a mystery stock. After months of buying, Berkshiren now owns a 6.4% stake in Chubb worth nearly $7 billion.\nChubb is such a great match for Berkshire that it's a wonder Buffett hasn't bought it in the past. The company sells property and casualty, personal accident, supplemental health, and life insurance in 54 countries and territories. It also offers reinsurance.\nBerkshire's insurance businesses already include GEICO (which primarily markets auto, home, and life insurance), Guard (which primarily offers commercial and excess and surplus insurance), and General Re (a top reinsurer). Chubb's products largely complement Berkshire's insurance offerings.\nChubb is strong financially. It's consistently profitable. And its shares are valued attractively with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 12.5.\nI think Chubb just might be Buffett's next \"whale.\" However, I believe another company could be a great \"guppy\" for him to add to Berkshire's long list of subsidiaries.\nKinsale Capital Group (NYSE: KNSL) focuses on a niche market -- excess and surplus (E&S) insurance for small businesses. Sure, Berkshire is already in the E&S market. However, acquiring Kinsale would give it the cream of the crop, in my view.\nThe average combined ratio between 2021 and 2023 among the top specialty insurers was 92.8%. Kinsale's combined ratio during this period was 77.2%. Why is Kinsale so much more profitable than its peers? Two factors especially stand out.\nFirst, the company's underwriting process is top-notch. Unlike many of its rivals, Kinsale doesn't delegate underwriting to agents, brokers, or other third parties. Second, the company's technology platform increases its operational efficiency.\nGranted, Buffett might be somewhat leery of Kinsale's valuation with shares trading above 31 times forward earnings. However, Berkshire's portfolio includes even more expensive stocks (I'm especially looking at you, Nu and Snowflake.)\nI think Kinsale deserves a premium valuation. The stock's compounded annual growth rate of 51% between 2016 and 2023 is nearly four times greater than the gains for the S&P 500 during the period. So far in 2024, Kinsale has more than tripled the S&P's returns.\nBerkshire Hathaway could easily afford to buy Chubb and Kinsale. Chubb's market cap hovers around $108 billion, while Kinsale's market cap stands below $11 billion. Buffett could acquire both insurers and still have over $150 billion in cash even if he paid a good bit more than what they're currently worth.\nWill Buffett use some of Berkshire's massive cash stockpile to buy a portion or all of these companies? I don't know. Even if he doesn't, both Chubb and Kinsale are great picks for long-term investors who don't have quite as much cash as Buffett does.\nBefore you buy stock in Chubb, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chubb wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) stock has rallied more than 20% over the past 12 months, and only trades about 3% below its all-time high. Warren Buffett's diversified conglomerate generated those steady returns even as inflation, elevated interest rates, and geopolitical conflicts rattled the broader markets.\nInvestors might be wary of chasing that rally, but Berkshire's Class B shares are still trading below Wall Street's target-price range of $465 to $506. Should investors load up on this evergreen stock before it reaches that lowest price target?\nA young Warren Buffett bought his first shares of Berkshire Hathaway, which was a struggling textile maker at the time, for his fund in 1962. Buffett eventually acquired the entire company in 1965, liquidated its textile division, and transformed it into a diversified conglomerate with acquisitions and investments across a broad range of industries.\nBerkshire Hathaway initially focused on acquiring cash-rich insurance companies, and it now owns major insurers like GEICO, Gen Re, and Alleghany. Its wholly owned insurance underwriting and insurance-investment subsidiaries generated 40% of its total operating earnings in 2023. The remaining 60% came from its other subsidiaries, which mainly include companies across the railroad, utility, energy, and consumer staples sectors. Here's how its core businesses fared over the past two years.\nOperating Earnings by Segment\n2022\n2023\nGrowth\nInsurance Underwriting\n($30 million)\n$5.43 billion\nN/A\nInsurance Investment Income\n$6.48 billion\n$9.57 billion\n48%\nRailroads\n$5.95 billion\n$5.09 billion\n(14%)\nUtilities and Energy\n$3.90 billion\n$2.33 billion\n(40%)\nOther Businesses & Misc.\n$14.55 billion\n$14.94 billion\n3%\nTotal\n$30.85 billion\n$37.35 billion\n21%\nData source: Berkshire Hathaway.\nLast year, the robust growth of its insurance underwriting and investment units offset the macro-induced headwinds for its other non-insurance subsidiaries. Those trends boosted its operating earnings 26% year over year in the first half of 2024.\nBerkshire Hathaway's operating earnings notably exclude any gains or losses from its closely watched investment portfolio, which includes nearly 50 stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Those investments can cause its net earnings to fluctuate wildly from year to year, so Buffett usually tells his investors to prioritize its operating earnings over its reported earnings per share (EPS).\nBerkshire Hathaway's business might seem sprawling and complicated, but its core strategies are easy to understand. It generates a lot of cash through its wholly owned subsidiaries, and it invests a lot of that capital back into its investment portfolio and short-term treasuries. It also regularly prunes its investment portfolio to raise extra cash. That's why it ended the second quarter with a whopping $277 billion in cash and equivalents.\nBerkshire Hathaway isn't an exciting growth stock, but its broad diversification and strong cash-flow growth make it an appealing alternative to an S&P 500 index fund. It's also an ideal stock for investors to buy, hold, and simply forget about.\nWith an enterprise value of $1.01 trillion, Berkshire Hathaway only trades at 3.6 times its cash holdings. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which Berkshire Hathaway holds a major stake in, trades at 21.6 times the $153 billion in cash and equivalents it held in its latest quarter.\nBerkshire Hathaway trades at 19 times forward earnings, but that multiple is pegged to its fluctuating investment portfolio. But if we assume it grows its operating earnings by just 20% this year, then it trades at less than 23 times that estimate.\nLooking ahead, let's assume Berkshire Hathaway continues to grow its annual operating earnings at a modest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% from 2023 to 2030. If it maintains that momentum, its operating earnings could reach $100 billion by the final year. If it trades at 20 times that figure, its enterprise value would roughly double to $2 trillion by the end of the decade.\nA lot of things could happen over the next few years. The market could crash, geopolitical conflicts could worsen, and Buffett's successor Greg Abel might make a few mistakes after he takes the helm. But if you believe Berkshire Hathaway can leverage its scale to overcome those challenges, then it's a good idea to buy its evergreen stock before it hits Wall Street's lowest price target.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s 10 Go-To Stocks for Success.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against Jim Cramer's other go-to stocks for success.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer offers a perspective on Nvidia and its recent market behavior on Wednesday's episode of Mad Money, presenting a straightforward analysis of the company's stock performance and the broader implications for investors. Cramer notes that owning the company's stock was easier when the company was less well-known. As the company has become a major market focus, it's attracted significant attention and criticism, which is evident after its recent financial report.\n\"Once you get this big, to the point where you become the focal point of the entire stock market, you're going to have a target on your back. And that's exactly what I think happened tonight to the stock after the firm reported a fine and dandy set of numbers. But fine and dandy is no longer enough for this incredible company.\"\nDespite reporting impressive numbers\u2014122% revenue growth, a 152% increase in adjusted earnings per share, and a $50 billion buyback\u2014 the firm's stock fell after hours. This reaction reflects high expectations that may have become unrealistic. The stock market as a whole suffered due to pre-quarter jitters surrounding the company, with declines in major indices like the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite. The drop in the firm's stock price after the earnings report, coupled with concerns about its influence on the broader market, has led some to call this period the GPU maker's \"buzzkill quarter.\"\n\"The Dow declining 59 points was bad, the S&P losing 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite 1.12%. And now, with the stock sinking after hours, we could be in for a hangover from what they're already calling the company's buzzkill quarter. But the people saying this might as well be having a watch party\u2014yes, there was one\u2014but there's nothing to celebrate here. Move on.\"\nCramer emphasizes that the company's role in artificial intelligence is significant, but its overemphasis has become a burden on the market. The company's market capitalization has skyrocketed from around $500 billion to over $3 trillion in just 18 months. Cramer suggests that the company's immense importance might be overblown and that a recalibration might benefit the market.\n\"We know that artificial intelligence is the way of the future, and it's the best bet on AI. But the company has become an albatross around the market's neck because no one stock should be a proxy for the future of the S&P 500. Yet, that's exactly what's happened as the company has grown from around $500 billion in market cap just 18 months ago to more than $3 trillion now. Maybe after tonight, it will shed that millstone\u2014like Apple did. You know what? That would be a godsend for all of us.\"\nCramer expresses frustration with how quickly concerns about the company have spread to the broader tech sector, although he acknowledges that companies like Salesforce reported positive numbers. Cramer concludes by advising investors to diversify their portfolios beyond just tech stocks. He suggests that while diversification might seem less exciting, it is a crucial strategy to mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on a single sector or stock.\n\"It felt like insult added to injury when there was no injury to the company. It will muddle through and recharge at its next iteration. Blackwell goes boring, and we see renewed expectations. I hope they don't get excessive like they were tonight.\"\nOur Methodology\nThis article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed ten stocks he believes have significant growth potential. It also looks at how hedge funds view these stocks and ranks them based on their level of hedge fund ownership, starting with the least owned and moving to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "Text": "Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), often referred to as \"The Oracle of Omaha,\" is a towering figure in the world of investing. As the Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has transformed a modest textile company into a powerhouse conglomerate through disciplined, value-focused investment strategies. His approach, deeply rooted in the principles taught by Benjamin Graham, seeks to invest in understandable, well-managed companies at attractive prices. The latest 13F filing for the second quarter of 2024 offers a window into Buffett's strategic maneuvers during a dynamic market period.\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) has strategically increased his stakes in several companies. Noteworthy among these is Chubb Ltd (NYSE:CB), where Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway added approximately 5,823,840 shares, bringing the total to 25,923,840 shares. This adjustment marks a substantial 28.97% increase in share count, reflecting a 0.46% impact on the current portfolio, with a total value of $6,717,644,660. Another significant increase was in Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMK), with an additional 22,277,997 shares, resulting in a 51.56% increase in share count and a portfolio value of $1,945,597,620.\nIn a notable strategic shift, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) completely liquidated Berkshire Hathaway's position in HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ), selling all 22,852,715 shares. This move resulted in a -0.2% impact on the portfolio, signaling a significant reallocation of resources.\nBuffett's recent portfolio adjustments include significant reductions. The most impactful was the reduction in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), where Berkshire Hathaway cut its holdings by 116,191,550 shares, resulting in a -12.83% decrease in shares and a -6.36% impact on the portfolio. During the quarter, Apple's stock traded at an average price of $181.83, with an 18.56% return over the past three months and a 17.14% year-to-date increase.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett Disciple Guy Spier\u2019s 10 High Conviction Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A) stands against Guy Spier\u2019s other high conviction stock picks.\nGuy Spier\u2019s\u00a0Aquamarine Capital Management\u00a0is\u00a0a Zurich, Switzerland-based investment manager that employs the same long-term oriented, value investment approach as Warren Buffett, who Mr. Spier proudly considers himself a disciple of.\nSpier earned a degree in philosophy, politics, and economics from Oxford University in 1988 and followed that up with an MBA from Harvard Business School. Foollowing that, he spent several years working as a researcher and investor on Wall Street, including stints at Braxton Associates and Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, the latter of which inspired him to launch his own value investing fund in 1997.\nSpier is noteworthy in the investment world for his $650,100 lunch (alongside\u00a0Mohnish Pabrai) with Warren Buffett in 2007, which was purchased through a charity auction. Spier took several important lessons from that meeting, including the necessity of saying no, and ultimately wrote a book about his takeaways from that lunch and his broader investment journey entitled \u2018The Education of a Value Investor: My Transformative Quest for Wealth, Wisdom, and Enlightenment\u2019.\nMr. Spier makes all of his firm\u2019s investment decisions himself and is an even more ardent value investor than Buffett, holding on to many of his positions for several years without touching them. In the second quarter the fund added two small new positions to its 13F portfolio while otherwise leaving the rest of it untouched. Its 13F portfolio held $263 million worth of assets on June 30, 74% of which were invested in finance stocks.\nAquamarine\u2019s total return stands at 874% since inception through the end of 2023, or 9% annually, outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 717% returns during that period. Spier\u2019s fund hasn\u2019t been as successful in recent years however. It returned 18.7% last year, which underperformed the market, the sixth-straight year it\u2019s failed to top the market. 2000, 2002, and 2006 were three of the fund\u2019s strongest years, as it beat the market by more than 20%.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\u00a0That\u2019s why you should pay close attention to this important indicator.\nA team of insurance professionals in a boardroom overlooking a city skyline.\nValue of Aquamarine Capital Management\u2019s 13F Position (6/30/2024): $57.2 million (BRK.B), $18.4 million (BRK.A)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders (3/31/2024):\u00a0155\nTopping the list of Guy Spier\u2019s stock picks is his large investment in Warren Buffett\u2019s holding company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A). Aquamarine Capital has owned 140,600 shares of BRK.B dating back to late 2015 and the stock has ranked as its top pick throughout much of the intervening 8+ years. Berkshire Hathaway has consistently ranked as one of hedge funds\u2019 favorite stocks, as fellow investors try to capture just a little bit of Warren Buffett\u2019s magic.\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A)\u00a0ranks as the\u00a0The Most Profitable Insurance Company in the World, generating $3.6 billion in underwriting earnings during its 2023 fiscal year. Geico is one of several insurance companies owned by Berkshire, which also owns a range of other businesses such as Duracell, Dairy Queen, BNSF, and Fruit of the Loom. The company\u2019s fiscal Q1 earnings jumped by 41% to $5.19 per share, while operating profit soared 39% to $11.2 billion.\nIn addition to owning several high-profile companies, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A)\u00a0also holds Buffett\u2019s gargantuan investment portfolio, which was valued at $332 billion on March 31. The company is also sitting on a record pile of cash totaling $189 billion as of March 31, giving it ample ammunition to make a major acquisition if its finds the right deal. In the meantime the company has been buying back more of its stock to put some of its cash to use, taking $2.6 billion worth of its shares out of circulation in Q1.\nOverall, BRK.A ranks 1st on our list of Guy Spier\u2019s high conviction stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of BRK.A, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) updated investors on its second-quarter financial results Saturday, revealing its cash pile rose to a record high as it made more cuts to its stake in Apple (AAPL), while its operating profit surged as its insurance underwriting business made gains, and more.\nBerkshire's cash and U.S. Treasury holdings rose to another record high in the second quarter at $276.9 billion, with $234.6 billion of that in Treasury bills. In the first quarter, the company\u2019s cash pile totaled $189 billion.\nBuffett has been a longtime fan of Treasurys, calling them \u201cthe safest investment there is\u201d at Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting in May, though the massive size of Berkshire\u2019s growing reserve has raised speculation about how the company might eventually deploy it\u2014or keep adding to it, with Treasury bill yields over 5%.\nWhile the firm could move to expand its portfolio, Buffett suggested earlier this year that few candidates in the U.S. satisfy Berkshire\u2019s criteria, with \"essentially no candidates\u201d elsewhere, saying \u201cthings aren\u2019t attractive.\u201d\nThe rise in Berkshire's cash pile came as it said it sold $75.5 billion worth of stock in the quarter. The company used $345 million to buy back Berkshire stock.\nAfter trimming its stake in Apple by about 13% in the first quarter, Berkshire cut its stake further, reporting that its Apple holdings were valued at $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, suggesting it sold about 390 million shares or nearly half its stake.\nBerkshire also lowered its stake in Bank of America (BAC). While not reflected in Saturday's report, Berkshire continued trimming its stake in Bank of America in July, recent filings showed.\nBerkshire retains significant stakes in Apple and Bank of America despite the cuts, with the two stocks still representing its top holdings, though Berkshire\u2019s selling spree over the last few quarters has raised speculation Buffett may be concerned about the market becoming overheated or raising cash for successors.\nBack in May, Buffett had suggested earlier sales of Apple stock came as Berkshire was building its cash position, and said it\u2019s \"extremely likely\" Apple would still be Berkshire's largest holding at the end of 2024.\nBerkshire\u2019s operating income, which Buffett has said provides a better picture of the health of the company's businesses than net income, came in at $11.6 billion, up from $11.2 billion in the first quarter, and $10 billion a year earlier.\nNearly half of the gains in Berkshire\u2019s operating income came from underwriting and investments in Berkshire's insurance businesses as claims costs and catastrophe claims eased. Berkshire\u2019s BNSF Railway and Berkshire Hathaway Energy utility businesses weighed on results.\nBerkshire Hathaway's Class B shares have outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year, up about 20% since the start of the year, at $428.36 as of Friday's close.\nRead the original article on Investopedia.\n"

        "Title": "Berkshire Hathaway Likes Ulta Beauty. Should You?",
        "Author": "  Jinjoo Lee ",
        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Warren Buffett has famously advised investors to be greedy when others are fearful. This past week, the company scooped up shares of Ulta Beauty, which landed in the discount bin after spooking the market. The stock still looks cheap.\nUlta Beauty is an off-mall, large-format retail chain (a typical store is about 10,000 square feet) that sells everything from mass-market beauty products to luxury cosmetics and fragrances one might expect to see at department stores. Its shares have jumped 15% since Berkshire Hathaway disclosed in a filing post-market close on Wednesday that it held about $266 million worth of the retailer\u2019s shares at the end of June.\nThe CEO Who Made a Fortune While His Hospital Chain Collapsed\nSam Altman\u2019s Worldcoin Is Battling With Governments Over Your Eyes\nBattling for Budget Bookings, Discount Airlines Offer \u2018Poor Man\u2019s First Class\u2019\nClean Fuel Startups Were Supposed to Be the Next Big Thing. Now They Are Collapsing.\nBerkshire Hathaway Likes Ulta Beauty. Should You?\nUlta Beauty, which was founded in 1990, and LVMH-owned Sephora, which opened its first U.S. store in 1998, changed the way customers shopped for makeup. Before their entry, shopping for beauty products typically happened at department stores, where a lot of items were locked up behind the counters and trying anything on involved an interaction with a store employee, says Simeon Siegel, equity analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Ulta Beauty and Sephora freed up that experience, opening up samples so that customers could try everything on without needing to ask for help, though they do have employees who can provide assistance if shoppers need it.\nThe retailer certainly has the business fundamentals that value investors would like. Despite being a relatively mature business, it has increased its top line at a compound average growth rate of 11% over the past five years. It also has an attractive margin profile, largely thanks to lower rents and operating costs that come with its off-mall presence, according to Siegel. Its operating margins are close to 15%\u2014roughly double that of a composite of retailers that are part of the S&P 500 and comparable to off-price retailers such as TJX Cos.\nUlta has a healthy balance sheet and has been an effective capital allocator: Its return on invested capital has averaged over 26% over the last five years, above Costco\u2019s 18% average. It has a fairly diversified product range, both in terms of price range and category, which means it isn\u2019t as vulnerable to one-off beauty trends or a change in economic conditions.\nWhile the company\u2019s shares soared in the self-care obsession-fueled postpandemic years, they took a big hit in March after the company gave full-year earnings guidance that fell just a touch below Wall Street expectations. They gradually edged even lower after Ulta Beauty lowered guidance again in late May. But the market reaction did seem outsize compared with the actual numbers: Before Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s disclosure, Ulta\u2019s shares had dropped 42% since its March earnings call. Yet earnings-per-share expectations for the current fiscal year have only declined about 5% and revenue expectations are just 1.4% lower, according to analysts polled by FactSet.\nThe tricky part, of course, is figuring out how much fear is actually warranted. Ulta Beauty does have some real threats on the horizon: The retailer said in its late-May earnings call that it lost market share in prestige brands, noting that \u201cmore than 1,000 new points of distribution\u201d have opened in the past two years. Much of this is probably referring to Sephora, which has opened up inside more than 900 Kohl\u2019s department stores since 2021 and will end the year in more than 1,000 Kohl\u2019s stores. Another emerging threat is Amazon.com, where luxury cosmetic brands have been broadening distribution.\nUlta\u2019s heady growth days are probably behind it: In the 2010s, the retailer added about 100 stores every year, but that has slowed to 30-50 in recent years. The company sees a runway for 1,500 to 1,700 more stores in the U.S.\nNevertheless, the format itself seems to have a built-in moat against online and direct-to-consumer selling: Makeup and fragrance is a category that shoppers want to try out, and preferably with variety across different brands. Ulta\u2019s supply-chain scale, relationships with vendors and a good pipeline of exclusive partnerships (its latest includes a Kylie Jenner fragrance) are difficult to replicate, according to a recent report from Oliver Chen, equity analyst at Cowen. Importantly, it has a very loyal base of customers. The sales headwind from the aggressive Sephora additions should subside somewhat by 2025, when Kohl\u2019s is expected to have opened a Sephora in all of its 1,100-plus locations.\nEven after the recent bump, the company\u2019s shares trade at about 14 times forward-12-month earnings, 44% below its 10-year average. It is among the cheapest retailers in the S&P 500 on that measure, only slightly more expensive than beleaguered electronics retailer Best Buy.\nThat is a very attractive price for a still-growing retailer with a lot of inner strength and a few surface-level blemishes.\nWrite to Jinjoo Lee at jinjoo.lee@wsj.com\nHow Safe Am I Online?\u2014and Other Questions Readers Asked About Cybersecurity\nHow China Is Becoming a Money Pit for Foreign Automakers, in Charts\nWeek Ahead for FX, Bonds: Central Bank Action in Focus as Jackson Hole Begins\nSpecter of Trump Tariffs Hangs Over Markets\nHow Inflation and Overspending Are Keeping Gen Z Stuck in a Debt Trap\n"

        "Title": "Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B): Leading the Pack in Auto Insurance Amidst Soaring Costs and Claims",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Car Insurance Rates Skyrocketing: 10 Best Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against the other car insurance stocks.\nEver since the coronavirus pandemic, a wide variety of industries, ranging from technology to energy and finance have been dealing with a changed economic environment. When it comes to auto insurance, the immediate aftermath of the pandemic\u2019s outbreak was a boon for auto insurance companies. It saw them bathe in money as the number of drivers on the roads significantly dropped and they had fewer claims to process. Data from the Consumer Federation of America\u00a0shows\u00a0that in 2020, auto insurers earned a whopping $29 billion in profit at a time when their premium claims percentage dropped to 56.1% from the average of 67.4% between 2016 and 2019.\nYet, just like their peers in the homeowner insurance industry would find out, the rising inflation after the pandemic made the next year one of the hardest for the auto insurance industry. Along with economic inflation, \u2018social inflation\u2019 which is a term that the industry uses to describe a harsh view of companies among jurors, would disrupt the auto insurance industry. After the pandemic, used car prices jumped by as much as 40%, and since insurance premium increases require regulator approval, the companies could not increase their prices to keep pace.\nIn fact, in 2021, all of the top auto insurers in the US saw their loss ratios rise. A loss ratio measures the ratio of payouts to premiums earned and a lower ratio is naturally preferred. According to the S&P, some insurers whose ratios were as low as 49.8% and 51.7% in 2020 saw these jump by tens of percentage points to 60.7% and 67.3%. For some insurers, these were the worst ratios since at least 2017. As they struggled to raise premiums, with some regions such as California having two year moratoriums on rate increases, 2022 ended up being the worst year on record for the auto insurance industry since 2000. Another key metric to evaluate insurance companies is the combined ratio, which adds payouts to expenses and divides them by premiums. A value lower than 100 indicates profitability and vice versa.\nAs per the S&P\u2019s\u00a0data, the net combined ratio for US private auto insurers was 111.8% in 2022 as it crossed the 2000 high of 110.4% by more than a percentage point. Their loss ratio also further deteriorated. From its 2021 value of 67.6%, the loss ratio jumped by 12 percentage points to sit at 79.8% the next year. Auto insurers responded to this challenge by cutting their costs, as their expense ratio dropped to 21.7% in 2022.\nJust as the auto insurance industry\u2019s fate rapidly changed between 2020 and 2021/2022, the same happened in 2023. According to the Labor Department\u2019s data for May 2023, auto insurance premiums shot up by 17.1% over the past 12 months, with rising medical bills, claims, and repair costs coupled with a dropping auto inventory contributing to the jump. This wasn\u2019t the end for soaring auto insurance costs, with the March 2024 Consumer Price Index showing that car insurance premiums were 22.2% more expensive in America. This was more than 6x the inflation rate of 3.5%, and the pricier auto insurance costs were due to the usual culprits of repair and repair and maintenance costs. These surged by 11.6% and 8.2%, respectively, during the same time period.\nAt the same time, since the world opened itself up again after the coronavirus pandemic, car accidents have also grown. These are also to blame for high car insurance costs since more accidents mean greater payout frequency, and as the insurers would argue, social inflation contributes to higher payout severity as well. These trends were already in play last year, with crashes and claim severity jumping by 14% and 36% in July 2023 according to the American Property Casualty Insurance Association (APCIA).\nIn addition to inflation, accidents, and severity, other causes are also responsible for soaring auto insurance costs in America. In a report that covered 34 cities, the Council on Criminal Justice revealed that car thefts had grown by 29%. These figures are corroborated by the National Crime Insurance Bureau, which believes that 2023 was the second consecutive year for more than one million car thefts in the US. Finally, auto insurers, like homeowner insurers, are also suffering from more climate catastrophes. Hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes all lead to property damage, and if they increase in frequency, then auto insurers will naturally increase their premiums to create room for the rising payouts.\nOur Methodology\nFor our list of the best auto insurance stocks, we ranked property and casualty, diversified, and specialty insurance companies by the number of hedge funds that had bought their shares in Q1 2024.

        "Author": "  Leo Schwartz ",
        "Text": "Every quarter, investors eagerly await the quarterly filing from investment giant Berkshire Hathaway that offers up wisdom on how the \"Oracle of Omaha\" is viewing the stock market.\nOn Wednesday, Warren Buffett's firm filed its latest holdings snapshot with the Securities and Exchange Commission, revealing a massive reduction in its Apple stake, along with a complete exit from its nearly $1 billion position in Snowflake, a cloud-based data company that has become one of the top publicly traded stocks for the red-hot AI sector.\nAs Berkshire Hathaway retreats to holding more cash and U.S. Treasurys amid an uncertain economy, the filing demonstrates that the world's most famous stock picker may be cooling on the hype cycle around artificial intelligence.\nKnown for its commitment to \"value investing,\" or focusing on stocks that appear to be underestimated by the market, Berkshire Hathaway has nonetheless loaded up on tech stocks in recent years\u2014a sector known more for its astronomic growth while also maintaining a healthy skepticism about sky-high prices. Buffett began loading up on Apple in 2016, with the iPhone producer representing 50% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio by the end of 2023.\nWhile Berkshire Hathaway continues to invest in other industries\u2014including energy, with a growing stake in the oil company Occidental\u2014Buffett has continued to invest in tech stocks, including Amazon and the domain-name platform Verisign. Perhaps its most attention-grabbing move, however, was acquiring a nearly $1 billion stake in Snowflake in the first quarter of 2024.\nOpportunities for publicly traded stocks in the AI sector remain scarce, with options largely restricted to Nvidia and other members of the so-called Magnificent Seven\u2014a cohort of the largest tech companies, including Microsoft and Alphabet\u2014which have invested heavily in the emerging sector, along with more downstream companies such as utilities. Many of the pure AI firms, such as OpenAI, remain private companies.\nSnowflake is a notable exception. Founded in 2012, the company offers data storage and processing services, which is a necessity for AI development. Snowflake went public in September 2020 with a market cap of over $33 billion and has become a proxy for many investors looking to gain exposure in AI.\nThough Snowflake started the year strong, with its share price rising from around $190 to over $235 in February, it has since dropped to around $127. According to a May report from Morningstar, the company's revenue growth is continuing ahead of expectations, though its expected margins are moving in the wrong direction. \"There is still some risk from decelerating revenue growth,\" wrote strategist Eric Compton, though he noted that Snowflake seems to have a head start on competitors in the AI sector.\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\nBuffett seemed to share the bearish view, with Berkshire Hathaway shedding its entire position of around 6 million shares of Snowflake, according to Wednesday's filing. The company also further trimmed its Apple holdings by about half, though the stock still remains its top holding and nearly a third of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio.\nWhile Buffett did not detail his strategy on Snowflake at Berkshire Hathaway's last shareholder meeting in May, he did reiterate that Treasury bills are the \"safest investment there is.\" Its holdings increased to nearly $235 billion, up 81% from the end of 2023, with Berkshire Hathaway now owning more short-term Treasuries than the Federal Reserve.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

However, we urge investors and reporters to read our 10-Q, which has been posted at www.berkshirehathaway.com. The limited information that follows in this press release is not adequate for making an informed investment judgment.\nEarnings of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries for the second quarter and first six months of 2024 and 2023 are summarized below.

In the table above, investment gains (losses) in 2024 include after-tax realized gains on sales of investments of $47.0 billion in the second quarter and $58.2 billion in the first six months and in 2023 include after-tax realized gains on sales of investments of $1.6 billion in the second quarter and $3.3 billion in the first six months.

At June 30, 2024, insurance float (the net liabilities we assume under insurance contracts) was approximately $169 billion.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures in accordance with Regulation G are included herein.\nBerkshire presents its results in the way it believes will be most meaningful and useful, as well as most transparent, to the investing public and others who use Berkshire\u2019s financial information. That presentation includes the use of certain non-GAAP financial measures. In addition to the GAAP presentations of net earnings, Berkshire shows operating earnings defined as net earnings exclusive of investment and derivative gains (losses) and impairments of goodwill and intangible assets.\nAlthough the investment of insurance and reinsurance premiums to generate investment income and investment gains or losses is an integral part of Berkshire\u2019s operations, the generation of investment gains or losses is independent of the insurance underwriting process. Moreover, as previously described, under applicable GAAP accounting requirements, we are required to include the changes in unrealized gains (losses) of our equity security investments as a component of investment gains (losses) in our periodic earnings statements. In sum, investment gains (losses) for any particular period are not indicative of quarterly business performance.\nAbout Berkshire\nBerkshire Hathaway and its subsidiaries engage in diverse business activities including insurance and reinsurance, utilities and energy, freight rail transportation, manufacturing, retailing and services.

        "Author": "  LaToya Scott ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway are making waves in the investment world, but it has nothing to do with some snazzy tech investment or megamerger. The company quietly amassed a jaw-dropping $234.6 billion in short-term U.S. Treasury bills, overshadowing the Federal Reserve\u2019s $195 billion holdings.\nDon't Miss:\nMiami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city before that happens.\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\nOne of the most talked-about moves among financial experts has become rife with speculation, and perhaps Buffett knows something everybody else doesn't.\nThe latest earnings report from the company showed the figure was up from $130 billion in Treasury bills at the end of last year. T-bills, as they are more commonly called, are issued for maturities of four to 52 weeks and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. More importantly, interest from T-bills is exempt from state and local taxes, which makes these instruments all the more attractive to big players like Berkshire Hathaway.\nTrending: Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, and this platform allows individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000 offering a 12% target yield with a bonus 1% return boost today!\nWhy is Berkshire Hathaway going big on T-bills now? The broader market conditions might hold the answer. Buffett explained why at the company\u2019s annual meeting in May: \u201cWe believe that holding cash and its equivalents is a safer bet than diving deeper into the stock market at this time.\u201d Stocks may give better returns but are fraught with higher risks, especially when the market is volatile. In contrast, T-bills are low-return instruments that provide security with ultralow risk.\nBerkshire\u2019s decision to boost its cash and cash equivalents \u2013 an umbrella term including Treasury bills \u2013 resulted in a record reserve of $277 billion at the end of the last quarter, leaping significantly from the $189 billion reported as of the close of the previous quarter. Some financial analysts scratched their heads over this move, while others see it as a classic Buffett strategy: play it safe when the market is uncertain.\nTrending: Institutional investors are increasingly turning to private credit for higher potential returns and lower volatility. You can copy their strategy by investing in your own private credit deals.\nThis ramping up in T-bill holdings dovetails with Berkshire\u2019s move to cut its stake in Apple \u2013 one of its most profitable investments. At the end of June, Berkshire had cut its Apple holdings in half to $84 billion. Despite this move, Apple still represents Berkshire's most significant stock investment, more than double the size of its next-biggest holding, Bank of America, which is at $41 billion.\nSome analysts believe Buffett\u2019s more cautious approach reflects his concerns about the current economic environment. \u201cBuffett is signaling that he sees more value in safety than in taking on additional risk,\u201d one financial expert noted. Others believe it might be a deeper strategy to protect Berkshire's assets against prospective market slumps.\nAs far as investors and market observers are concerned, Warren Buffett\u2019s investment strategy is one to watch. Only time can prove whether this massive bet on T-bills will pay off in the long run. However, as of now, it is one move that places Berkshire Hathaway in a league all by itself, way ahead of the Federal Reserve.\nRead Next:\nThis billion-dollar fund has invested in the next big real estate boom, here's how you can join for $10.\nElon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US.

        "Title": "Warren Buffett Just Cut Half of Berkshire Hathaway's Stake in Apple. Why?",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett once referred in 2020 to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as Berkshire's third business, following its insurance arm and the BNSF railroad. However, that may not be the case for much longer.\nThe Buffett-led conglomerate unwound a large chunk of its stake in the iPhone maker in the second quarter, the company revealed in its recent earnings report. Berkshire cut its holdings in Apple from $135.4 billion at the end of the first quarter to $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter.\nApple stock also soared by 23% during the second quarter. If you assume the sale came toward the end of the quarter, Berkshire dumped roughly half of its Apple shares. Berkshire had begun selling Apple in the first quarter, and the value of its stake in the tech giant is down 56% from the end of 2023, when it was worth $174.3 billion.\nWhy did Berkshire dump so much of its Apple stake after Buffett had trumpeted the company's praises so many times? There's no clear answer to that question, but I can make several educated guesses, based on Buffett's past behavior and Berkshire's historical patterns. Here's a closer look.\nAfter Berkshire's 13-F filing in May showed that the company had sold more than 116 million shares of Apple, cutting its stake by 13%, Buffett addressed the move at the annual shareholder meeting in May. He implied that the sale was to hedge any risk of capital gains tax rates going up, telling his audience: \"If I'm doing it [paying capital gains tax] at 21% this year and we're doing it a little higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact we sold a little Apple this year.\"\nBuffett was referring to talk in Washington about the capital gains tax rate going up, though there are no specific plans to raise it. However, it's possible that Berkshire continued to sell Apple in the second quarter for the same tax-motivated reason, though there's been no progress in raising the capital gains tax rate recently.\nBuffett hasn't made a specific comment on Apple's valuation, but has bemoaned pricey valuations in the stock market at times and seems to believe prices are stretched again.\nAnd Apple stock has gotten expensive. It finished the quarter with a price-to-earnings ratio above 32, reaching its highest level since the early days of the pandemic, when its growth soared, driven by remote work and school and the need for new devices.\nBy comparison, Apple's growth has slowed considerably since then, with revenue up 4% in its most recent quarter. Under those circumstances, Berkshire's trimming its ownership of Apple would make sense, though it's unclear if the sale was motivated by valuation.\nAnother plausible reason for Berkshire to sell Apple is to raise cash, perhaps to buy a different stock or make an outright acquisition. In Berkshire's May shareholder letter, Buffett did refer to the company's ability to capitalize on market sell-offs as \"our not-so-secret weapon.\" In order to do use that weapon, Berkshire needs cash on hand to be able to buy discounted stocks and businesses. In that regard, selling Apple, by far Berkshire's largest holding, makes sense.\nThe sale helped Berkshire beef up its cash hoard, as the company finished the second quarter with $272 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term Treasury bills. That's up substantially from $163 billion at the start of the year.\nIt's possible that Buffett and his Berkshire management team have been preparing for a market sell-off, and it seems like they've been rewarded with one. The S&P 500 gave up 6% over a three-day span ending on Monday.\nWhat's also notable is that Berkshire hasn't significantly reduced any of its other top-five holdings, though it has been selling some Bank of America stock recently. That indicates there may be more than raising cash behind the Apple stock sales.\nWe should learn a bit more when Berkshire files its 13-F update on its holdings next week, which will reveal a full list of buys and sells.\nApple still remains Berkshire's biggest holding after the second quarter and could certainly stay that way, so the sale may have been driven by rebalancing as well as other portfolio management guidelines. It's also possible that Apple's valuation or slowing growth contributed to the sale.\nWhile we'll probably never know for sure, Apple investors should take comfort in knowing that the stock remains Berkshire's largest holding and Buffett has lauded the company on several occasions.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  JOSH FUNK ",
        "Text": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Billionaire Warren Buffett slashed Berkshire Hathaway's massive Apple stake in a move that could prove unsettling for the broader stock market \u2014 both because the investor is so revered and because there had been little positive financial news lately.\nJust two years ago Buffett called the stock one of the four giants of his conglomerate's business alongside Berkshire insurance, utility and BNSF railroad businesses that it owns outright. That gave investors the impression that Buffett might hold onto Apple indefinitely as he has with the Coca-Cola and American Express shares he bought decades ago.\nHowever, he has trimmed the Apple stake over the past year and has recently also sold off some of his stock in Bank of America and Chinese EV maker BYD while doing very little buying.\nAs a result, Buffett is now sitting on nearly $277 billion in cash, up from what was already a record $189 billion just three months earlier.\n\u201cThis could could alarm the markets especially given the news from last week\u201d with weak tech earnings, a disappointing jobs report and uncertainty about the future of interest rates, Edward Jones analyst Jim Shanahan said.\nBuffett has consistently lavished praise on Apple CEO Tim Cook, who attended Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha in May, and talked about the way consumers are feverishly devoted to their iPhones and don't like to switch. He did trim more than 10% of Berkshire's Apple stake in the first three months of this year when he sold off more than 116 million shares, but the sale disclosed Saturday was a much bigger move.\nWedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note that he thinks \u201cBuffett is a core believer in Apple and we do not view this as a smoke signal for bad news ahead.\u201d Apple remains the largest investment in Berkshire's portfolio by far \u2014 more than double its Bank of America stake.\nIves said he thinks the recent tech sell-off is only a temporary distraction from the industry's long-term boom.\nBerkshire didn\u2019t give an exact count of its Apple shares in Saturday\u2019s report, but it estimated the investment was worth $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter even though shares soared over the summer as high as $237.23. At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire\u2019s Apple stake was worth $135.4 billion.\nShanahan estimates that Berkshire still holds about 400 million Apple shares.\nStill, while CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said she looks at the Apple sale more as responsible portfolio management because the tech giant had become such a large portion of Berkshire's holdings, it does look like Buffett may be preparing for a downturn.\n\u201cThis is a company girding itself for a weaker economic climate,\u201d Seifert said.\nBerkshire reported a small drop in its bottom-line earnings because of a drop in the paper value of its investments. The company said it earned $30.348 billion, or $21,122 per Class A share, during the second quarter. That\u2019s down from $35.912 billion, or $24,775 per A share, a year ago.\nBuffett has long cautioned investors that it's better to look at Berkshire's operating earnings when judging its performance because those figures exclude investment gains and losses which can vary widely from quarter to quarter.\nBy that measure, Berkshire's operating earnings grew more than 15% to $11.598 billion, or $8,072.16 per Class A share, from $10.043 billion, or $6,928.40 per Class A share, a year ago. Geico led the improvement of Berkshire's businesses while many of its other companies that are more sensitive to the economy reported lackluster results.\nThe results easily topped the $6,530.25 earnings per share that four analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.\nBerkshire owns an assortment of insurance businesses along with BNSF railroad, several major utilities and a varied collection of retail and manufacturing businesses, including brands like Dairy Queen and See's Candy.\n"

        "Title": "Warren Buffett's Biggest Bets in 2024: 40% of Berkshire Hathaway's $276.9 Billion Stock Portfolio Is Held in Just 2 Stocks",
        "Author": "  Keith Noonan and Jennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "With a market capitalization of more than $950 billion, Berkshire Hathaway ranks as the world's eighth-largest company. Led by CEO and world-famous investor Warren Buffett, the company has delivered incredible returns for its long-term shareholders and continues to be massively influential in the investing world.\nNotably, the Oracle of Omaha has never been much of a fan of portfolio diversification and has instead preferred to weight Berkshire's stock holdings heavily toward a small number of high-conviction investments. But Buffett and Berkshire have actually been making some dramatic moves lately, and the balance of the company's portfolio has shifted in some big ways.\nLet's take a look at two of the stocks where he's most invested in now.\nKeith Noonan (Apple): Berkshire Hathaway shocked the world with its recent 13F filing. With the disclosure report it submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this month, the investment conglomerate revealed that it had sold more than 389 million shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock. The move reduced Berkshire's total investment in the tech giant by 49%, and immediately raised concerns that Buffett was losing faith in the tech leader.\nOn the other hand, Apple is still Berkshire Hathaway's biggest stock investment by far. Even after the sell-off, the iPhone company's stock still accounts for roughly 28.8% of Berkshire's total stock portfolio -- more than three times larger than its second-biggest position.\nWhile Buffett has argued against diversification in the past, it's not hard to see why his company opted to reduce its exposure to the tech giant. At its concentration and valuation peak, Apple accounted for more than half of Berkshire's total stock portfolio.\nThe investment has been a massive winner for the Oracle of Omaha's company, and the recent stock sale has generated enviable profits. But the question of whether Berkshire will continue to take profits on its Apple investment will likely remain a hotly contested issue until Buffett's company publishes its next 13F filing.\nBuffett has previously described Apple as \"probably the best business\" he knows of, but there are some big questions about what comes next for the mobile leader. For starters, it remains to be seen whether Apple will be able to deliver big wins in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Investors and analysts are also wondering whether the company can serve up major new wins in mobile and other hardware categories that are capable of driving big growth.\nBerkshire's moves to trim its position in Apple stand out among this year's most high-profile moves for institutional investors. But while Buffett has reduced his company's exposure to the mobile leader, it seems like he's still bullish on the stock overall.\nJennifer Saibil (American Express): There are two stocks Warren Buffett has repeatedly said he would never sell: Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), his longest-held stock, and American Express (NYSE: AXP), his second-longest.\nBank of America (NYSE: BAC), though, was his second-largest position for a long time. Recently, after Buffett sold a chunk of BofA and did some other reallocation of his portfolio, American Express has slid into that slot. It accounts for 12.2% of Berkshire's total equity holdings as of this writing.\nAmerican Express is a great example of the classic Buffett stock. For starters, it trades at less than 19 times trailing 12-month sales. That's well below the average S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio of 27. Buffett loves undervalued stocks, and as long as American Express stock trades at a low valuation, he's likely to stick with it.\nIt has an established, distinctive model. It's different than credit card networks Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA) in a few important ways. It's a closed-loop system, which means that it acts as its own bank and doesn't rely on third-party relationships to fund the credit it provides shoppers to use when they spend. Since it has its own bank, it has an expanded set of services that give it more ways to make money. Buffett loves companies that have a varied set of earnings streams. He also loves bank stocks, since they tend to have lots of cash, which is the anchor of a long-term viable company.\nAmerican Express has a fee model. Its loyal cardholders pay annual fees for the privilege of using most of the company's cards, which come with a slew of perks. It's also known for its top rewards program, which keeps cardholders paying year after year and attracts new ones.\nAmerican Express has successfully refreshed its image and most of its cards to appeal to a younger, affluent cohort, and they have a long runway of spending ahead. The niche, upscale target market gives American Express a moat against challengers, as well as resilience under pressure.\nThat's another way American Express fits into the Buffett model. It plays a large role in the development of the economy, and cardmembers rely on it for necessities and luxuries. Expect American Express to keep up its good work and keep providing value for Buffett and other shareholders.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jonathan Stempel ",
        "Text": "By Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) - Warren Buffett appears to have soured on stocks, letting cash at Berkshire Hathaway soar to nearly $277 billion and selling about half its stake in Apple, even as the conglomerate posted a record quarterly operating profit.\nBerkshire's results released on Saturday suggest the 93-year-old Buffett, one of the world's most revered investors, is growing wary about the broader U.S. economy, or stock market valuations that have gotten too high.\nThe results followed a stock market selloff that pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory, and a weak jobs report that sparked worries about U.S. economic activity and whether the Federal Reserve waited too long to cut interest rates.\n\"If you look at the entire Berkshire picture and the macroeconomic data, a safe conclusion is that Berkshire is getting defensive,\" said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire a \"buy.\"\nBerkshire's cash stake grew to $276.9 billion as of June 30 from a then-record $189 billion three months earlier, largely because Berkshire sold a net $75.5 billion of stocks.\nIt sold about 390 million Apple shares in the second quarter, on top of 115 million sold from January to March, as the iPhone maker's stock price rose 23%. Berkshire still owned about 400 million shares worth $84.2 billion as of June 30.\nThe second quarter was the seventh straight quarter that Berkshire sold more stocks than it bought.\nBerkshire also repurchased just $345 million of its own stock, down from $2.57 billion in the first quarter, and none in the first three weeks of July.\n\"Buffett doesn't seem to think there are attractive opportunities in publicly traded stocks, including his own,\" said Jim Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst with a \"hold\" rating on Berkshire. \"It makes me worry what he thinks about markets and the economy.\"\nGEICO BOOSTS RESULTS\nSecond-quarter profit from Berkshire's dozens of businesses rose 15% to $11.6 billion, or about $8,073 per Class A share, from $10.04 billion a year earlier.\nNearly half of that profit came from Berkshire's insurance businesses including Geico car insurance, where underwriting profit more than tripled as premiums rose and claims fell.\nBut revenue rose just 1% to $93.65 billion, with little change in major businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and a 12% drop at the Pilot truck stop chain.\nConsumers also showed signs of cutting back, causing revenue to decline at Berkshire's more than 80 auto dealerships because they spent less per vehicle on new cars, trucks and SUVs.\nBerkshire's returns from short-term Treasuries should decline once rate cuts begin.\nShanahan said that and revenue headwinds \"may make it tough for Berkshire to deliver earnings growth in 2025.\"\nThe Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns many industrial and manufacturing companies, a big real estate brokerage, Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom.\nQuarterly net income fell 15% to $30.34 billion from $35.91 billion a year earlier, as rising stock prices in both periods boosted the value of Berkshire's stock investments.\nBuffett has long urged shareholders to ignore Berkshire's quarterly investment gains and losses, which often lead to outsized net profits or net losses.\nBUFFETT WANTS TO SPEND, BUT DOESN'T\nBerkshire pledges to keep a minimum $30 billion of cash, but often lets it build up when it can't find whole businesses or individual stocks to buy at fair prices.\nSince mid-July, Berkshire has also sold more than $3.8 billion of shares in Bank of America, its second-largest stock holding.\n\"We'd love to spend it, but we won't spend it unless we think we're doing something that has very little risk and can make us a lot of money,\" Buffett said at Berkshire's May 4 annual meeting, referring to Berkshire's cash.\nBuffett said he expected Apple to remain Berkshire's largest stock investment, but selling made sense because the 21% federal tax rate on the gains would likely grow.\nThe sales came only two years after Buffett labeled Apple one of Berkshire's \"four giants,\" along with its insurance businesses, BNSF and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.\nBerkshire and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday.\nProfit at BNSF fell 3% as the railroad set aside more money for lawsuits, offsetting lower operating costs and greater shipping of consumer and agricultural products.\nLawsuits against the PacifiCorp utility unit also weighed on Berkshire Hathaway Energy, where profit fell 17%.\nMany homeowners and businesses blame PacifiCorp for causing Oregon wildfires in 2020. The utility set aside $2.7 billion for wildfire losses as of June 30, up from $2.4 billion three months earlier, and said losses could grow significantly.\nBerkshire's Class A shares closed Friday at $641,435. They are up 18% this year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 is up 12%.\nBuffett has led Berkshire since 1965. Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 62, is expected to succeed him as chief executive.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Ira Iosebashvili, Jason Neely and Diane Craft)\n"

        "Text": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For instance, the price of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A) stock is up an impressive 114% over the last five years. In the last week shares have slid back 2.4%.\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n Check out our latest analysis for Berkshire Hathaway \nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Berkshire Hathaway achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 26% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 16% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Berkshire Hathaway's earnings, revenue and cash flow.\nBerkshire Hathaway provided a TSR of 20% over the year. That's fairly close to the broader market return. That gain looks pretty satisfying, and it is even better than the five-year TSR of 16% per year. It is possible that management foresight will bring growth well into the future, even if the share price slows down. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term.

The company is one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies with numerous diverse business activities. A strong cash position supports earnings-accretive bolt-on buyouts and is indicative of its financial flexibility.\u00a0Continued insurance business growth fuels an increase in float, drives earnings and generates maximum return on equity. The non-insurance businesses have also been doing well in the last few years. The addition of Pilot Travel Centers (PTC) has strengthened its energy business. A sturdy capital level provides further impetus.\u00a0However, exposure to cat loss induces earnings volatility and also affects underwriting results. Huge capital expenditure remains a headwind. With the demise of Charles Munger, uncertainty looms over the company's performance.(You can read the full research report on Berkshire Hathaway here >>>)Shares of Tesla have modestly outperformed the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry over the past six months (+4.9% vs. +2.0%). The company has been plagued by shrinking automotive margins amid aggressive price cuts and discounts. The company expects its vehicle volume growth rate for 2024 to be noticeably lower than 2023 amid a cooling electric vehicle (EV) market.\u00a0With competition intensifying in the EV space, Tesla\u2019s focus on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to be a game changer. It aims to launch affordable vehicles, transition into an AI company and is banking on its robotaxi venture.\u00a0The expected rollout of Tesla-supervised Full Self Driving (FSD) software in China and Europe by the end of the year will boost prospects. Additionally, TSLA\u2019s Energy Generation and Storage business is thriving.

The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting its overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.\u00a0However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. We expect adjusted operating expenses to jump 10.1% in fiscal 2024. It is witnessing a volatile cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. Moreover, rising client incentives will affect its adjusted revenues.(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)Shares of AXIL Brands\u2019 have underperformed the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry over the past year (-61.6% vs. -12.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $27.98 million is witnessing rising operating expenses and declining gross profit margins signal profitability challenges. Inventory management issues and high customer concentration risks add to the concerns.\u00a0Increased accounts payable and reduced cash flow from operating activities highlight cash flow volatility. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance. Nevertheless, AXIL is expanding globally, diversifying revenue streams across the United States, Canada, the EU and Asia.\u00a0Strategic initiatives, such as the NASCAR-branded hearing protection product deal with Racing Electronics and a distribution agreement with Kinsey\u2019s, boost market penetration.

        "Text": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Warren Buffett offered more details Wednesday about the stocks he has been selling lately, including confirming that he sold more than 389 million Apple shares during the second quarter.\nBerkshire Hathaway still owns 400 million shares of the iPhone maker, so it remains the biggest position in the conglomerate's stock portfolio, according to the company's latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The news that Buffett had unloaded a huge chunk of Apple came out in Berkshire's earnings report earlier this month, but the exact number of shares he sold wasn't clear until Wednesday.\nIn addition to the big Apple sale, Berkshire has also been trimming its investments in Bank of America, Chevron, Capital One, Floor & Decor Holdings, T-Mobile and Louisiana Pacific recently. Berkshire also unloaded its nearly $1 billion Snowflake investment.\nAs a result of all the selling, Berkshire's already massive cash pile has ballooned to the record level of $277 billion.\nBut Berkshire did sink more money into the insurer Chubb and oil producer Occidental Petroleum, while revealing smaller new investments in aerospace parts maker Heico Corp. and cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty.\nThe quarterly filings don't spell out which moves Buffett made and which actions were taken by one of the two other investment managers at Berkshire, but Buffett typically handles all the biggest investments worth more than $1 billion.\nAnd many investors watch Buffett's actions closely because he has such a remarkably successful track record over the decades.\nIn addition to the nearly $300 billion stock portfolio, Berkshire owns several major insurers, including Geico, one of the nation's largest railroads in BNSF, a collection of big utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies. Its holdings include well-known brands like Dairy Queen, Helzberg Diamonds and NetJets.\n"

        "Text": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) has again cut its stake in Bank of America BAC. The Oracle of Omaha offloaded nearly 14 million shares in three consecutive trading sessions. Berkshire now holds 928.5 million shares or about 12% stake in Bank of America.\u00a0Despite the trimmed stake, BAC remains the third largest holding of Berkshire, with Apple AAPL occupying the top position (nearly 29% stake) followed by American Express AXP (a little more than 12% stake).Shares of Berkshire Hathaway have gained 27.2% year to date, outperforming the industry\u2019s 26.2% growth, the Finance sector\u2019s rise of 13.6% and the S&P 500 composite\u2019s rise of 18.2%. \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nA cut in interest rate in September seems likely. The interest rate is currently at 5.5-5.5%, a 23-year high. As per a report published in CNBC, \u201cInflation has declined significantly. The labor market is no longer overheated, and conditions are now less tight than those that prevailed before the pandemic,\u201d Powell said. \u201cSupply constraints have normalized. And the balance of the risks to our two mandates has changed.\u201d\u00a0 This reinforces the chances of at least a quarter percentage point rate cut in September and raises the odds of a potential half-point reduction to about 1-in-3, according to CME Group\u2019s FedWatch.\u00a0Bank of America, being a direct beneficiary of an improved rate environment, experienced a significant improvement in net interest income. After 11 rate hikes from March 2022 through July 2023, a rate cut will no doubt hit the net interest income though a lower rate will drive net interest margin expansion.\nBerkshire shares are trading well above the 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend. Shares are trading near the high end of its 52-week range. \nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBerkshire Hathaway is a conglomerate with more than 90 subsidiaries engaged in diverse business activities. Its property and casualty insurance business, one of the largest property and casualty insurance companies, generates the maximum return on equity. The company also benefits from diverse earnings streams, including utilities and energy, and manufacturing, service and retail.With a huge cash hoard, Berkshire Hathaway acquires entities or adds stakes of companies that have consistent earning power and generate impressive returns on equity or add.\u00a0 While big acquisitions open up more business opportunities for the company, bolt-on acquisitions enhance the earnings of the existing business. \u00a0Warren Buffett has always eyed acquisitions or made investments in properties that are undervalued and have potential for growth. Investments in Coca-Cola and American Express show the investment acumen of Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger. Berkshire Hathaway also has stakes in behemoths like Apple, Bank of America, Chevron and Occidental Petroleum.However, Buffett never shies away from offloading stocks or stakes if he does not find them fit for his investment basket. Getting rid of Snowflake (SNOW) is an example of the same. This provider of a cloud-based data platform has been incurring losses for several quarters and seems nowhere near reaching profitability soon. Also, shares of SNOW have lost 54.4% since it went public in 2020.\nThe stock is overvalued compared to its industry. It is currently trading at a price-to-book multiple of 1.61, higher than the industry average of 1.59.\u00a0 However, we believe that given Berkshire Hathaway's dominant market presence, diverse business activities, and, above all, the name Warren Buffett, a premium valuation is quite justified for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nReturn on equity in the trailing 12 months was 7.4%, underperforming the industry average of 8%. Return on equity, a profitability measure, reflects how effectively a company is utilizing its shareholders. It's noteworthy that though BRK.B\u2019s ROE is lagging behind the industry average, the company successfully improved the same.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nIts return on invested capital (ROIC) has increased every year since 2020. This reflects BRK.B\u2019s efficiency in utilizing funds to generate income. However, ROIC in the trailing 12 months was 5.8%, lower than the industry average of 6.1%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTwo of the three analysts covering the stock have raised estimates for 2024 and 2025 over the past 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 implies a 14.4% year-over-year increase, while the same for 2025 suggests a 1.3% increase.

It gives a feel of investing in mutual funds. But above all, the company has Warren Buffett at its helm, who has been creating tremendous value for shareholders over nearly six decades with his unique skills.\u00a0Thus, investors who already hold Berkshire shares should continue to retain the stock in their portfolio as it is unlikely to disappoint investors.\u00a0However, given its premium valuation, new investors can wait for a better entry point.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.\nThe Data: According to Berkshire's most recent filing, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company now owns $234 billion in treasury bills.\nThat's more than the Federal Reserve's $195 billion treasury bill war chest. The U.S. central bank has gradually wound down its balance sheet in recent years.\nIt is also more than several countries, including Brazil, Germany and Mexico.\nBerkshire held $97 billion in treasury bills a year ago, still a mighty sum but less than half of today's mark. Its stock has appreciated over 20% since then.\nCheck It Out: Private credit offers up to 20% APY. Potential accredited investors are looking to capitalize on this growing asset class.

Its future use of artificial intelligence is still unclear. Berkshire's Apple position is still its largest holding, but down over 50% since the end of 2023.\nOn a larger scale, Buffett could be bearish on the U.S. economy. Recession fears have intensified and the market has undergone a significant pullback since the beginning of summer.\nAlternatively, Buffett could simply be holding cash to forestall a large, future acquisition. The Omaha native has long championed taking advantage of market dips with large investments. Many of his acquisitions come as surprises to the market.\nRegardless, the nonagenarian is taking advantage of the high interest rate environment \u2014 over 5% \u2014 and delivering operating profit growth to shareholders.\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

        "Title": "4 key lessons following Warren Buffett\u2019s move to sell half of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Apple stock",
        "Author": "  Brian Baker, CFA ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett sold roughly half of Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Apple during the second quarter and revealed a record cash pile of more than $270 billion at the end of June, contributing to investor concerns about a possible recession.\nApple remained Berkshire\u2019s largest stock position at the end of the second quarter, worth $84.2 billion, down from $174.3 billion at the end of 2023. Buffett started selling Apple in the fourth quarter of last year, but the selling has accelerated in 2024.\nBuffett praised the iPhone-maker\u2019s business at Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting in May, saying that it was very likely to remain Berkshire\u2019s largest position at the end of 2024 and that it would likely continue to hold Apple after he\u2019s no longer running the company.\nBuffett\u2019s decision to reduce Berkshire\u2019s Apple holdings provides some key lessons that individual investors can learn from when managing their own portfolios. Here are the key takeaways.\nBy selling Berkshire\u2019s largest position, Buffett is reducing the impact it will have on Berkshire\u2019s value going forward. If Berkshire hadn\u2019t sold any of its Apple shares, the stake would have been worth nearly $200 billion at the end of June, compared to Berkshire\u2019s market cap of about $890 billion. Even if Buffett still likes Apple\u2019s business, a stake that large would have an outsized impact on Berkshire over time.\nIndividual investors can also benefit from periodic portfolio rebalancing. While you may not have an individual stock that has grown as much as Apple, there may be funds you hold that account for a larger portion of your portfolio than you originally intended. Reducing those holdings and adding to positions that have lagged can be an effective way to manage risk in your portfolio.\nNo matter how good a business is, its price can get to a level where investors aren\u2019t able to earn an attractive return over the long term. When Berkshire first bought Apple in 2016 it sold for about 10 times its annual earnings per share. Over time, that price-earnings ratio has expanded and is now around 30.\nBuffett may still love Apple\u2019s business characteristics as much as he did when he established the position, but there\u2019s a big difference between paying a P/E multiple of 10 versus 30. Companies need to grow earnings at a high rate to justify their high multiples and for a company as large as Apple, that\u2019s not as easy as it once was.\nBuffett has said that many investors focus too much on avoiding taxes. With capital gains taxes, you don\u2019t owe any taxes until the gain is realized, that is until you\u2019ve sold some of the investment. Buffett clearly doesn\u2019t mind paying taxes on gains at today\u2019s low rates when they could be higher down the road.\n\u201cWe are paying a 21 percent federal rate on the gains we\u2019re taking in Apple,\u201d Buffett told shareholders in May. \u201cThat rate was 35 percent not that long ago and it\u2019s been 52 percent in the past when I\u2019ve been operating.\u201d\n\u201cI would say with the present fiscal policies, I think that something has to give and I think that higher taxes are quite likely,\u201d Buffett said.\nOne interesting aspect of Buffett selling Apple is the similarity with another Berkshire investment that once reached an elevated valuation: Coca-Cola. In the late 1990s, shares of Coca-Cola had skyrocketed from Berkshire\u2019s initial purchase in the late 1980s and traded for around 40 times earnings.\nBuffett was on Coca-Cola\u2019s board of directors at the time, a position that made it difficult for him to sell the stock, even though he likely knew it was overvalued. Buffett\u2019s longtime business partner Charlie Munger reportedly urged Buffett to resign from Coke\u2019s board so that Berkshire could sell its shares, according to Buffett biographer Alice Schroeder, but Buffett remained and Berkshire held its shares.\nAt the end of 1998, Berkshire\u2019s Coke stake was worth $13.4 billion. Twelve years later, at the end of 2010, the stake was $13.2 billion. Berkshire collected dividends during that time, but the high multiple of the late \u201890s acted as an anchor on the stock for more than a decade. Buffett seems determined to avoid the same mistake with Berkshire\u2019s Apple shares.\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision. In addition, investors are advised that past investment product performance is no guarantee of future price appreciation.\n"

        "Text": "SANTA BARBARA, Calif., August 05, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kelly Knight, a market leading agent since 2005 and a former real estate attorney, recently chose to align her talent with Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties. Previously with a different local brokerage, Knight has earned awards for her sales production, community service and ability to navigate complex transactions.\n\"Kelly\u2019s business sense and tactful yet strategic negotiating style have made her a perennial market leader in our area for years,\" commented Kyle Kemp, Regional Vice President for Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. \"Her long list of achievements in real estate are no surprise given the strength of her resume and extensive professional background.\"\nKnight spent 15 years practicing law at one of Santa Barbara\u2019s top firms prior to her transition to real estate, building exceptional communication skills and a proficiency in contract review.

        "Text": "Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has commented on Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway, Inc.\u2018s (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) decision to sell about half its stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).\nWhat Happened: Over the weekend, a user on X, formerly Twitter, shared the news of Berkshire accumulating a cash reserve of almost $277 billion on the platform.\nDon't Miss:\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nDon\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\nThe user humorously suggested that Buffett could make daring, all-in investments with this cash reserve, and acquire any of these companies: Netflix, Salesforce, Toyota, Adobe, and Hermes.\nIn response to the user, Musk said, \u201cHe [Buffett] is clearly expecting a correction of some kind or otherwise simply cannot see better investments than Treasury bills.\u201d\nThe tech mogul also criticized the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates, suggesting that the current rates are too high.\nTrending: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\u201cThe Fed needs to drop rates. They have been foolish not to have done so already,\u201d he stated.\n\nWhy It Matters: Circuit breakers were triggered for Japan's TOPIX index, halting trading as the index dropped over 6%, leading to urgent stabilization measures on Sunday night.\nThe broader Asia-Pacific region saw declines, with the MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index falling 2%, Japan's Nikkei 225 plummeting 5.60%, and South Korea's KOSPI index dropping 4%.\nSee Also:\u00a0Here\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\nThis continued a trend from Friday, when Japan's Nikkei 225 and TOPIX both fell over 5% and 6%, respectively. In the U.S., markets faced significant losses on Friday due to a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, with the Nasdaq dropping over 10%, and the S&P 500 and Dow decreasing by 5.7% and 3.9%, respectively. At the time of writing, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 0.81%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 1.43% and 2.4%.\nNotably, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s second-quarter net earnings fell year-over-year due to a decline in investment gains, despite an increase in operating earnings. The company continued to offload its stake in Apple during this period.\nSee Also:\u00a0If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nIn the second quarter, net earnings experienced a 15.50% decline year-over-year, dropping from $35.91 billion to $30.35 billion. On the other hand, operating earnings\u2014reflecting income from the company\u2019s portfolio entities\u2014increased by 15.48%, reaching $11.60 billion.\nGains from the investment portfolio saw a significant decrease of 27.52%, falling to $18.75 billion.\nMeanwhile, Berkshire\u2019s swelling cash position has also led to speculation on social media about potential investments, with some Tesla fans hoping that Buffett would invest in the electric vehicle maker\u2019s stock.\nRead Next: \nThis city is the clear winner of Zillow's 2024 Home Value Forecast \u2014 No surprise as the number of millionaires there grew by 75% in the last decade.\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article Elon Musk Says Warren Buffett Is 'Clearly Expecting A Correction' After Berkshire Sold Nearly Half Of Its Apple Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

Despite this gigantic sell-off, Apple stock remains the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio.\nBuffett hinted during the Berkshire annual meeting in May that the sales were partially motivated by tax considerations. He suggested that reducing the Apple position could be advantageous for Berkshire shareholders should capital gains taxes increase in the future.\nApple stock had a robust second quarter, surging 23% and setting a new record, buoyed by investor enthusiasm over the company's focus on artificial intelligence. This surge in stock price followed a decline in the previous quarter amid concerns that Apple was lagging in AI innovation.\nAt one point, Berkshire's investment in Apple represented half of its entire equity portfolio.\nIn addition to Apple, Buffett has been actively trimming positions in other major holdings.\nNotably, he has also begun to cut its stake in Berkshire's second-largest investment, Bank of America.\nRelated Articles\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire sold nearly half of its Apple stake\nAbrdn finance chief Jason Windsor to replace Stephen Bird as CEO, Financial Times reports\nEarnings call: FCR reports solid Q2 with record rental rates and growth\n"

It was recently reported that Berkshire cut its Apple AAPL stake by 50% last quarter and added to its massive cash hoard. While the reasons for the sale were not disclosed, many interpreted it as a sign of Buffett\u2019s concerns about stock market valuations.\nThere are many questions about succession at Berkshire, particularly after the passing of Charlie Munger. We discuss why Buffett's decision to sell Apple may reflect cash management for succession planning.\nGreg Abel, currently vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, is set to succeed Buffett at the helm of the company. Buffett\u2019s deputies, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, will also be involved in managing Berkshire\u2019s vast equity portfolio.\nThe Financial Times recently examined the performance of these two investment lieutenants and concluded that their portfolios often lagged behind both the SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY and Berkshire itself.\nMoreover, while Berkshire has significantly outperformed the broader market over several decades, its most substantial outperformance occurred in the earlier years when the conglomerate was much smaller.\nBuffett has long recommended that most investors stick with low-cost index funds. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO charge just 0.03% each, but the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF SPLG fee of 0.02% makes it the cheapest in this space.\nThe legendary investor favors companies with \u201ceconomic moats,\u201d which he describes as \"economic castles protected by unbreachable moats.\u201d In simple terms, a moat is a unique competitive advantage that enables a company to outperform others in the same industry over time.\nThe VanEck Morningstar Wide Moat ETF MOAT invests in attractively priced companies with sustainable competitive advantages.\nTune in to the podcast to learn more.\nMake sure to be on the lookout for the next edition of ETF Spotlight!

        "Text": "While Warren Buffett\u2018s conglomerate only initiated its Apple investment in 2016, the company has been the cornerstone of Berkshire Hathaway\u2018s investment since then, accounting for a staggering 50% of its holdings in 2023.\nHowever, a shift has occurred over the past year in Berkshire Hathaway\u2018s strategy, as it slashed its Apple stake by nearly half during the second quarter of 2024, following a 13% reduction in the first quarter. While Buffett maintains optimism and a bullish view about Apple, this significant divestment suggests a strategic pivot that he expressed being towards building Berkshire\u2018s cash reserves.\nApple\u2018s stock price, after soaring nearly 50% in 2023, tumbled over 8% in the first quarter of 2024, according to ActivTrades data. Investor concerns about declining Chinese sales and overall slowing growth likely contributed to this downturn. This contrasted sharply with the S&P 500\u2018s 10% gain and the Nasdaq\u2018s 8% rise during the same period.\nApple\u2018s dominance in China\u2018s smartphone market is facing unprecedented challenges. iPhone sales plummeted by 19.1% in the first quarter of 2023, according to a Counterpoint Research\u2018s report published last April.\nThis sharp decline coincides with Huawei\u2018s resurgence,as the domestic giant saw a staggering 69.7% sales surge. Huawei\u2018s strengthened position, particularly in the premium segment, has significantly eroded Apple\u2018s market share.\nGreater China, comprised of mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, once Apple\u2018s most lucrative market, witnessed a 6% sales decline last quarter, despite accounting for nearly half of the company\u2018s total revenue. While currency fluctuations impacted sales, the underlying weakness in the mainland market is undeniable.\nTo counter these challenges, Apple is betting on its upcoming iPhone and the integration of advanced AI capabilities.\nBy introducing AI-powered features like enhanced Siri, advanced photo editing, and intelligent text interaction, Apple aims to differentiate its products and regain lost ground. However, navigating China\u2018s complex regulatory landscape while successfully implementing AI technology will be crucial for the company\u2018s success.\nThere is still a lack of consensus among analysts on the possible influence that Apple Intelligence, its push into artificial intelligence, might have on iPhone sales. While there are many who believe that the software will usher in a new age of iPhone sales, there are others who take a more cautious approach.\nApple\u2018s stock experienced a meteoric rise of over 35% between April\u2018s low and its mid-July peak of $237 per share. This surge was primarily driven by investor excitement following the company\u2018s ambitious AI announcements at the June Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).\nKey AI initiatives unveiled at the conference included deeper integration with OpenAI\u2018s ChatGPT to enhance Siri\u2018s capabilities, the introduction of customizable Genmoji emojis powered by Apple\u2018s AI, and the expansion of Apple\u2018s Writing Tools to seamlessly work within third-party applications.\nApple\u2018s potential new iPhones, which would be driven by artificial intelligence, are expected to revolutionise the smartphone industry, which is fuelling long-term optimism over Apple\u2018s stock. Recent price drops, on the other hand, indicate that investors are pondering the real impact of AI on Apple\u2018s future results.\nDavid Vogt, an analyst at UBS, is among those who are sceptical. Despite the fact that Apple\u2018s revenue for last quarter exceeded projections, mostly due to the performance of the iPad, other areas did not meet expectations, such as Mac and Wearables, Home, and Accessories. In addition, the company\u2018s forecast for the current quarter shows that the firm would continue to see only modest growth.\nWhile Vogt continues to retain a \u201cHold\u201d recommendation on Apple, with a price target of $190, this indicates that he has a cautious stance on the company\u2018s potential for growth in the foreseeable future.\nApple shares experienced a significant downturn yesterday, plunging by 4.96% after opening with a nearly 10% gap down.This sharp decline pushed the stock price into the green Ichimoku cloud, often interpreted as a zone of equilibrium or consolidation.\nTechnically, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has rapidly approached oversold territory following the sharp price drop.Prior to this, the RSI had been gradually declining and hovering near the neutral level of 50, indicating a loss of upward momentum.\nThe bearish gap and subsequent price action suggest a potential shift in market sentiment towards Apple. While the Ichimoku cloud provides initial support, traders should closely monitor price action and RSI developments for indications of a potential trend reversal or continued downside pressure.\nDisclaimer\nCFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage.

        "Text": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) updated investors on its second-quarter financial results Saturday, revealing its cash pile rose to a record high as it made more cuts to its stake in Apple (AAPL), while its operating profit surged as its insurance underwriting business made gains, and more.\nBerkshire's cash and U.S. Treasury holdings rose to another record high in the second quarter at $276.9 billion, with $234.6 billion of that in Treasury bills. In the first quarter, the company\u2019s cash pile totaled $189 billion.\nBuffett has been a longtime fan of Treasurys, calling them \u201cthe safest investment there is\u201d at Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting in May, though the massive size of Berkshire\u2019s growing reserve has raised speculation about how the company might eventually deploy it\u2014or keep adding to it, with Treasury bill yields over 5%.\nWhile the firm could move to expand its portfolio, Buffett suggested earlier this year that few candidates in the U.S. satisfy Berkshire\u2019s criteria, with \"essentially no candidates\u201d elsewhere, saying \u201cthings aren\u2019t attractive.\u201d\nThe rise in Berkshire's cash pile came as it said it sold $75.5 billion worth of stock in the quarter. The company used $345 million to buy back Berkshire stock.\nAfter trimming its stake in Apple by about 13% in the first quarter, Berkshire cut its stake further, reporting that its Apple holdings were valued at $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, suggesting it sold about 390 million shares or nearly half its stake.\nBerkshire also lowered its stake in Bank of America (BAC). While not reflected in Saturday's report, Berkshire continued trimming its stake in Bank of America in July, recent filings showed.\nBerkshire retains significant stakes in Apple and Bank of America despite the cuts, with the two stocks still representing its top holdings, though Berkshire\u2019s selling spree over the last few quarters has raised speculation Buffett may be concerned about the market becoming overheated or raising cash for successors.\nBack in May, Buffett had suggested earlier sales of Apple stock came as Berkshire was building its cash position, and said it\u2019s \"extremely likely\" Apple would still be Berkshire's largest holding at the end of 2024.\nBerkshire\u2019s operating income, which Buffett has said provides a better picture of the health of the company's businesses than net income, came in at $11.6 billion, up from $11.2 billion in the first quarter, and $10 billion a year earlier.\nNearly half of the gains in Berkshire\u2019s operating income came from underwriting and investments in Berkshire's insurance businesses as claims costs and catastrophe claims eased. Berkshire\u2019s BNSF Railway and Berkshire Hathaway Energy utility businesses weighed on results.\nBerkshire Hathaway's Class B shares have outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year, up about 20% since the start of the year, at $428.36 as of Friday's close.\nRead the original article on Investopedia.\n"

        "Author": " David Hollerith    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) surpassed a market cap of $1 trillion for the first time on Wednesday as it continues to sell some holdings in Bank of America (BAC).\nBerkshire is the first outside the tech world to reach that exclusive territory in the US, which currently includes just six other companies.\nThe move comes after Berkshire disclosed late Tuesday that it had trimmed its stake in the nation's second-largest lender by another 24.6 million shares, generating $982 million.\nBerkshire has sold BofA stock in five of the past six weeks starting in mid-July, unloading a total of 129 million shares and earning $5.4 billion on those sales.\nBank of America\u2019s stock has fallen by more than 9% during Buffett\u2019s selling spree. It is still up roughly 18% so far this year, trailing larger gains by rivals Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Citigroup (C).\nBofA\u2019s stock was up more than 1% in Wednesday morning trading.\nBerkshire has not yet said anything about the motivation for selling some of its Bank of America stock. And it remains the bank\u2019s largest stockholder, with over 900 million shares worth more than $35 billion.\nThe recent moves are notable because of Buffett\u2019s long history with the bank. He injected $5 billion into Bank of America in 2011 as the lender struggled to overcome the wreckage of the subprime housing meltdown that caused the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nIt wasn't solely a bet on Bank of America's recovery but also on the new leadership of CEO Brian Moynihan, who took over the top job in 2009.\nThe endorsement from Buffett certainly helped restore some market confidence in the bank. Its stock has since climbed nearly 400%.\nBuffett stuck with Bank of America even as he began unloading stakes in other big lenders.\nBetween 2018 and 2022 he exited giant stakes in JPMorgan, Wells Fargo (WFC), and Goldman Sachs, some just months before the banking system upheaval that began in mid-March of 2023.\nBuffett began unloading the Wells Fargo position after a series of scandals rocked the bank, including revelations that employees pressured by sales goals opened millions of accounts that customers didn't want and charged fees that weren't necessary.\n\"We're very cautious \u2026 about ownership of banks and we do remain with one bank\u2026 I like Bank of America and I like the management,\" Buffett said at Berkshire\u2019s annual shareholder meeting in May 2023.\nBy June of this year, Bank of America accounted for 15% of Berkshire\u2019s portfolio as the firm slashed its stake in Apple (AAPL).\nNow it is the company\u2019s third-biggest position behind Apple and American Express (AXP).\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

(AP) \u2014 Warren Buffett offered more details Wednesday about the stocks he has been selling lately, including confirming that he sold more than 389 million Apple shares during the second quarter.\nBerkshire Hathaway still owns 400 million shares of the iPhone maker, so it remains the biggest position in the conglomerate's stock portfolio, according to the company's latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The news that Buffett had unloaded a huge chunk of Apple came out in Berkshire's earnings report earlier this month, but the exact number of shares he sold wasn't clear until Wednesday.\nIn addition to the big Apple sale, Berkshire has also been trimming its investments in Bank of America, Chevron, Capital One, Floor & Decor Holdings, T-Mobile and Louisiana Pacific recently. Berkshire also unloaded its nearly $1 billion Snowflake investment.\nAs a result of all the selling, Berkshire's already massive cash pile has ballooned to the record level of $277 billion.\nBut Berkshire did sink more money into the insurer Chubb and oil producer Occidental Petroleum, while revealing smaller new investments in aerospace parts maker Heico Corp. and cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty.\nThe quarterly filings don't spell out which moves Buffett made and which actions were taken by one of the two other investment managers at Berkshire, but Buffett typically handles all the biggest investments worth more than $1 billion.\nAnd many investors watch Buffett's actions closely because he has such a remarkably successful track record over the decades.\nIn addition to the nearly $300 billion stock portfolio, Berkshire owns several major insurers, including Geico, one of the nation's largest railroads in BNSF, a collection of big utilities and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies. Its holdings include well-known brands like Dairy Queen, Helzberg Diamonds and NetJets.\n"

That's up 81% from the roughly $130 billion it owned at the end of 2023.\nIt also eclipses the Federal Reserve's T-bill holdings, which stood at $195.3 billion as of last week.\nBuffett's preference for Treasurys is reflective of him being unable to find worthy investments that exceed the more-than-5% annualized risk-free offered by government debt. It has some worried that the billionaire investor has soured on the US stock market. He has historically raised cash when he sees few attractive opportunities to invest due to elevated valuations.\nFor context, the 1-month T-Bill yields 5.33%, the 3-month T-Bill at 5.22%, and the 6-month T-Bill at 4.95%.\nThose interest rates should generate risk-free gains of about $12 billion annually for Berkshire Hathaway's massive T-Bill holdings, or quarterly gains of about $3 billion.\nAt Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett called T-Bills \"the safest investment there is.\"\nTreasury bills also offer their investors tax incentives, as the interest paid is exempt from state and local taxes.\nThe Treasury additions weren't the only bold move by Berkshire in the second quarter. The company also cut its stake in Apple stock by about half during the period, selling about 390 million shares.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"
