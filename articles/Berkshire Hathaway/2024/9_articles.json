        "Text": "Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) sold more of its holdings in Bank of America (BAC), raising its total haul to nearly $9 billion over the last several months.\nLate Tuesday, the conglomerate said it further trimmed its stake in the country\u2019s second-largest bank by 21.6 million shares, making approximately $862.7 million in profits from the sales.\nBerkshire has sold BofA stock in 10 of the past 11 weeks starting in mid-July, unloading a total of 218.5 million shares and earning $8.9 billion on those sales.\nBerkshire still holds a 10.5% stake in the country's largest bank, and the price of Bank of America\u2019s stock has fallen roughly just as much since Buffett began selling his firm's longest-held bank stock position.\nBofA is still up 16% so far this year, trailing rivals Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Citigroup (C). Its stock was down slightly Wednesday morning.\nBuffett and Berkshire haven\u2019t yet said anything about the motivation for selling. And Berkshire remains the bank\u2019s largest stockholder, with over 800 million shares worth more than $32 billion.\n\"I don't know what exactly he's doing because, frankly, we can't ask, and we wouldn't,\" Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said earlier this month at a Barclays conference.\nRead more: Bank of America Mortgage review 2024\nThe recent moves are notable given Buffett\u2019s long history with the bank. He injected $5 billion into Bank of America in 2011 as the lender struggled to overcome the wreckage of the subprime housing meltdown that caused the 2008-2009 financial crisis.\nThat investment back then wasn't just a bet on Bank of America's recovery but also on the new leadership of CEO Brian Moynihan, who took over the top job in 2009.\n\u201cWe're buying the stock, a portion of the stock, and so life will go on. But he's been a great investor for our company and stabilized our company when we needed it at the time,\u201d Moynihan added.\nBank of America's financial performance isn't expected to dim over the near term, according to the latest guidance offered by CFO Alastair Borthwick at a conference on Wednesday.\nRate cuts from the Federal Reserve may help the bank as deposit costs drop and a big securities portfolio recovers.\nRead more: The Fed rate cut: What it means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards\nBank of America\u2019s major lending revenue stream, net interest income, is expected to have hit its bottom in the second quarter and grow from there through the end of the year, according to the CFO.\n\u201cWe still feel like that's the case,\u201d Borthwick said Wednesday at a London conference hosted by Bank of America.\n\u201cWe're back now to something more akin to a low growth, low inflation, and potentially a reasonable rate structure that should make it a pretty good environment for American banks,\u201d Borthwick added.\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "Warren Buffett might be the greatest investor the world has ever seen. If anything, he probably has the most public resume to make his argument. Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), offers decades of evidence of his Wall Street magic.\nHad you invested just $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway when it went public in 1980, you'd have over $2.3 million today. That's genuinely life-changing returns on a modest investment.\nHowever, Berkshire Hathaway is worth nearly $1 trillion today, and Buffett recently turned 94. Can the stock still turn long-term investors into millionaires?\nBuffett doesn't have an easy job. Berkshire Hathaway is a holding company, which is a business entity that owns various other businesses and assets. Berkshire Hathaway owns dozens of private companies, including GEICO Insurance, railroads, energy pipelines, manufacturers, and consumer-facing brands like Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. The company also operates an enormous stock portfolio with nearly four dozen positions worth approximately $316 billion. Buffett and his management team must act as conductors, pulling and pushing the right buttons and levers so that all these moving parts create value for Berkshire and its shareholders.\nBerkshire has been consistently successful at this, boosting its book value for decades through the economic ups and downs.\nThis steady value creation is driving the company's remarkable stock performance. Sure, Berkshire is a behemoth today, but the stock can create wealth for you if management wisely allocates Berkshire's vast financial resources to increase its book value.\nBuffett seemingly hasn't lost his touch or instincts in his old age.\nYou could credit Berkshire's soaring book value over the past decade to Buffett's investment in Apple, arguably his most extraordinary feat to date. Berkshire bought Apple in early 2016, when it traded at roughly 12 times earnings. Since then, Apple has been a multibagger, returning over 860%. The investment grew to be worth several hundreds of billions of dollars, and Buffett began selling it off earlier this year as Apple stock approached a price-to-earnings ratio of 35. That's the definition of \"Buy low, sell high.\"\nNot only did Berkshire capture much of its Apple returns by selling off a chunk of the stock, but Berkshire has financially equipped itself to be opportunistic again. The company now has an estimated $277 billion in cash, approximately 28% of its market cap today!\nKnowing Berkshire's track record, there's a good chance that Buffett or Berkshire's management team will eventually use that money well, and shareholders will benefit.\nApproaching Buffett's age as respectfully as possible, it's fair to wonder about Berkshire's long-term leadership. After all, Buffett is 94, and while he seems in good health and as sharp as ever, time eventually defeats us all. That said, investors shouldn't avoid Berkshire simply because Buffett won't be around forever to lead the ship.\nIt would be insulting to pretend that Berkshire isn't aware of this -- the company has a succession plan. Buffett has already tapped Greg Abel to lead Berkshire after he's gone. Abel has been with Berkshire for over 25 years and has undoubtedly played the student role under Buffett's mentorship.\nWill Abel allocate Berkshire's capital as well as Buffett has? There is only one Buffett, so that's a valid concern. However, Berkshire is one of the world's most financially and fundamentally robust companies. It could create value for its shareholders for decades to come. Consider having some faith until there's a reason not to.\nBerkshire can continue growing -- there are always additional investments or businesses to buy that can increase its book value. Don't forget that the companies within Berkshire also grow over time.\nIt's also fair to acknowledge that at a worth of nearly a trillion dollars, Berkshire is likely too big to generate the same returns it once did. The days of Berkshire turning $1,000 into a million dollars are probably over. However, Berkshire can still build wealth over time as part of a diversified portfolio.\nAnyone with a long-term time horizon should consider buying and holding this unique company.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks For Beginners With Little Money. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against the other stocks for beginners with little money.\n\u201cIn my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,\u201d believes Warren Buffett of\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway, who is the most successful investor not only in our time but also in human history. Buffett made the remarks at his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s 2020 Annual Meeting, but it wasn\u2019t the first time he shared similar thoughts. While most investment advisors and internet stock analysts are likely to boast about \u2018chasing the alpha,\u2019 for the Oracle of Omaha, who is currently worth $144.5 billion\u00a0excluding\u00a0his charitable donations over the years, most people are better off tracking the S&P.\nBuffett has, in fact, held this opinion for years. Speaking to CNBC in 2017, he\u00a0reiterated\u00a0that \u201cconsistently\u201d buying an index fund linked to the flagship S&P index is \u201cthe thing that makes the most sense practically all of the time.\u201d Buffett added that an investor should persist even during the bad times, when the \u201ctemptation when you see bad headlines in newspapers is to say, well, maybe I should skip a year or something.\u201d Do not give in, says the Oracle, and \u201cjust keep buying\u201d since \u201cAmerican business is going to do fine over time, so you know the investment universe is going to do very well.\u201d\nYet, there\u2019s another temptation that especially beginners to the stock market have to face. This is the rush to \u2018alpha\u2019 and by extension, wealth and riches. But according to Buffett, the \u201ctrick is not to pick the right company, the trick is to essentially buy all the big companies through the S&P 500 and to do it consistently and to do it in a very, very low cost way,\u201d since \u201cyou do not want to ever get the impression that you can pick stocks.\u201d This false belief carries the risk of making a beginner believe that they have an edge over others, while the reality \u201cjust doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d believes Buffett.\nHowever, just because you\u2019re a beginner with little money, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t make it big. Wall Street, despite its flaws, has also produced titans of the investing world who started out with little to nothing. One of the best examples of this fact is Ken Fisher of\u00a0Fisher Investments. Fisher\u2019s childhood didn\u2019t make him a stranger to Wall Street as his father Philip Fisher is one of the most consequential figures in Wall Street\u2019s history. Fisher Sr. was the original Cathie Wood who popularized growth investing and sought to invest through a strategy called \u201cscuttlebutt investing.\u201d\nFisher Sr. covered this strategy in his seminal work Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits (\u201cone of the great books on investing,\u201d as per Buffett) and shared that an investor should conduct in depth research for a firm by getting to know its executives and employees. While Fisher\u2019s father is a Wall Street legend, Ken started out his firm with just $250 in 1979. As of Q2 2024, the firm had $229 billion in investments as indicated through its SEC filings while Fisher\u2019s net worth is $11.2 billion.\nWhile today\u2019s $250 is far from being similar in value to $250 when Fisher started his investing journey, technology enables today\u2019s beginner investors to invest with even less money. One way to do so, if you\u2019re feeling bold enough to ignore Buffett\u2019s advice against stock picking, is to use fractional shares. Through these, a wide variety of brokerages enable beginners on the stock market to invest in stocks through as little as $1 and any dollar amount via features such as cash quantity stock orders. Fractional investing also enables some of the smallest investors to gain exposure to big ticket stocks, including Berkshire, whose Class B shares have a recent closing share price of $689,287.\nFinally, before we get to our list of the best stocks to buy for beginners with little money, another way for a beginner to start out with little money and grow portfolio value over time comes through\u00a0dividend stocks. These stocks offer beginner investors stable and often regular payouts over the long term. While everyone likes stable income, the true magic of these stocks is the ability to reinvest these dividends to generate even more returns. The benefits of reinvesting dividends are clear when we look at the data. This shows that a $1,000 investment in the benchmark S&P index would be worth $33,500 in 2022 without dividend reinvestment. But if the dividends were reinvestment, the final value nearly triple and would be worth $93,000.\nWith these details in mind, let\u2019s take a look at some of the best stocks to buy for beginners with little money. If you want to learn about a special stock that might be able to deliver 100x returns, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the best stocks to buy for beginners with little money, we first made a list of 20 stocks recommended by the financial media. Then, these were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q2 2024 and the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were selected.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NYSE:BRK-B) is Warren Buffett\u2019s investment holding company. Not only does it invest in stocks and hold on to them for dear life most of the time, but it also has a sizeable presence in the insurance industry. During the second quarter, $26 billion of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)\u2019s revenue came from insurance. It has a presence in both homeowners and auto insurance industry, with the latter being the larger business. For insurance specifically, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) benefits from cross selling home policies to its auto consumers. The firm is also well diversified, and it has a sizeable presence in cyclical and counter cyclical industries such as energy, green energy, construction, railroads, and aviation services. Finally, its fortress of a balance sheet sees Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) hold an unbelievable $234 billion in short term investments, which provides it with more liquidity than most banks in the world for a well rounded business model.\nThe London Company mentioned Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\u201cInsurance was once again a bright spot in Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

To discuss the likely rate cut path, Chris Versace, Tematica Research CIO, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance on September 24.\nVersace suggests that it is quite impossible to predict the path the Fed is to adopt before 2024 ends and the decision will likely be more reliant on data. The labor market weakened for the second consecutive month and, according to him, the Fed will probably go for another 50 basis point cut, if not more.\nHe urges investors and traders to triangulate all data points to make decisions including economic data, inflation data, and the speed at which the economy is growing. Versace states that the market right now is stretched and that there is more to the bigger picture such as the upcoming elections, earnings growth, and the Fed's decisions.\nOn September 25, Burns McKinney, NFJ Investment Group Managing Director & Senior Portfolio Manager, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the market outlook. Amid declining consumer confidence and a shrinking job market, volatility, according to him, will remain a constant element.\nHe suggested that signs of job weakness coupled with inflation have impacted consumer confidence negatively, especially after the Fed's decision. McKinney added that there is a disequilibrium in the number of jobs vacant and the number of workers available right now, leading to weakened employment data.\nFrom an investor standpoint, he deems volatility a constant state of the market, given that the country also has an upcoming election in the coming weeks. In addition to that, geopolitical tensions in Europe and the Middle East will likely add to the turmoil. McKinney shares that investors should focus more on dividend-paying stocks to remain secure and resilient through the volatility.\nDespite the turmoil, some stocks may always be promising given their strong footing and dominance in the industry.

        "Title": "Berkshire Hathaway: Buy, Sell, or Hold?",
        "Author": "  Ryan Vanzo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's a reason why nearly everyone who follows the stock market is familiar with Warren Buffett. Not only is he one of the greatest investors of all time, but a long-term stake in his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), has proven to be one of the best investments of all time. Over the nearly 60 years he's been at the helm, Berkshire's shares have grown at an annualized rate of roughly 20%.\nFor decades, all an investor needed to do in order to generate massive wealth was to invest with Buffett. But is that still true today?\nThe first thing for investors to understand is that Berkshire Hathaway is not immune to the law of large numbers. What does that mean? Simply put, a business with $1 million in sales has more opportunities to double its sales than a business with $1 billion in sales. Similarly, companies that are valued at $100 million will find it easier to double in size than those valued at $100 billion.\nWith a market cap that recently topped $1 trillion, Berkshire is one of the largest companies in the world. The value of the entire U.S. economy, for reference, is almost $29 trillion. Berkshire's cash stockpile alone comes to $277 billion. Berkshire made its name through decades' worth of smart acquisitions and shrewd investments, but even Buffett acknowledges that Berkshire's opportunities are dwindling as the company is growing. \"There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others,\" Buffett recently explained, adding that this size allowed for \"no possibility of eye-popping performance.\"\nSimply due to scale, Berkshire will find it more difficult to beat the market as handily as it has in the past. But that doesn't mean that Berkshire still can't beat the market by a slimmer margin.\nThis is the second thing every investor must understand: Berkshire is far from a dead investment. It has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last one-year, three-year, five-year, and 10-year time periods.\u00a0There's a good reason for this continued outperformance: Berkshire's business structure is designed for it.\nAt the core of Berkshire's empire sits a portfolio of insurance companies. These insurance businesses generate high levels of float, which is the excess cash insurers have after they collect policy premiums but before claims force them to pay that capital out. This float provides Berkshire with investable funds that it can deploy regardless of what markets are doing. It's a huge plus to have what Buffett calls \"permanent capital\" -- that is, a pool of money that is always available to put into new investments, especially when valuations crash and outside capital dries up.\nThis structural capital advantage isn't going away anytime soon, nor is the proven investing acumen of Buffett and his lieutenants -- some of whom have spent years learning from Buffett. The only challenge has been size, but recent results show that Berkshire's run is far from over.\nBRK.B Total Return Level data by YCharts\nThe simple answer is that there has never been a bad time to buy Berkshire stock in the past, and that remains true today. Of course, even the valuation of a high-quality business can get too high. But Berkshire's valuation is more than reasonable. Shares are trading at just under 1.7 times book value, which at first appears expensive compared to Berkshire's history. Never in the past decade have shares traded at such a high price-to-book basis. However, Berkshire has spent nearly $80 billion buying back its own stock since 2018, an act that has increased shareholder wealth while it artificially depressed accounting book value. A slight adjustment for this suggests Berkshire stock is simply valued on the high end of its historical range.\nIs Berkshire stock a steal at today's prices? For patient investors, yes.

The \"Oracle of Omaha\" is one of the most successful investors in history -- and one of the richest.\nThose lucky enough to have invested with Buffett and his firm early on have made out nicely and that's putting it lightly. Just a $1,000 investment in Berkshire in 1980 would be worth $2.4 million today.\nThose looking to add more Berkshire to their portfolios may be asking, is now a good time? Is the company fairly valued in the market? There are all sorts of ways to try to measure this. It's not easy though. The company is a massive conglomerate with disparate businesses and defies simple attempts at valuing its stock. Should you use a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio? Price-to-book (P/B)? What about a discounted cash flow (DCF) model?\nInstead, you could look to Buffett himself. In 2018, the board of directors of Berkshire changed the rules so that Buffett can repurchase shares of Berkshire anytime he believes them to be priced \"below Berkshire's intrinsic value, conservatively determined.\" Even if this isn't a quantitative metric, it's a gauge of Buffett's own sentiment. If major buybacks are happening, it means Buffett thinks his stock is undervalued. This is a number all Berkshire investors should pay attention to.\nHere's the company's track record over the past five years.\nBerkshire spent billions buying shares in that time. Interestingly, the buybacks hit their lowest level in some time last quarter. I would keep an eye on this trend, but remember there are lots of factors that go into this decision. Just because buybacks are lower doesn't necessarily mean the stock is overpriced in Buffet's view; he may believe there's a better way to use the company's resources at that time or shortly.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NYSE:BRK-B) stands against the other safe stocks to invest in.\nA probable rate cut has provided hope for the economy. Despite that, the impact on financial markets and stocks remains uncertain. On September 4, Adam Parker, Trivariate Research founder and CEO, appeared in an\u00a0interview\u00a0on\u00a0CNBC.\u00a0Parker was not surprised that tech stocks were down by close to 4% at the beginning of September, that too right before an impending rate cut. Parker highlights that the inconsistency in the market at the moment is not normal, and with multiple rate cuts over the next two years, he has no reason to hold a positive economic outlook. He suggests that eight probable rate cuts indicate that the economy is slowing, consumer spending is declining, and unemployment is rising, all of which are not good signs for the market. The interviewer counter questions that eight rate cuts with a 25 basis point reduction are not as disastrous to presume a faltering economy. Parker then highlights that rate cuts in the past have been supported by consistent data, an incremental fiscal, and an expansion of the balance sheet, all of which are currently out of the picture. You can also read our piece on the\u00a0best battery stocks to buy according to short sellers.\nOn September 2, CNBC published a detailed report on the impact of rate cuts on the stock market in the United States. The Fed, in the footsteps of countries in Europe and Asia, recently announced an easing cycle, after a long period of high interest rates. As per current pricing data, the Fed is expected to have three 25-basis point cuts by the end of this year. Speaking of the global economic outlook, 2025 will see a lower-rate environment followed by easing inflationary pressures. However, the fear of recession in the United States tells another story. Analysts believe that the last four months of 2024 will be considerably weak and choppy amid geopolitical factors, uncertainty from the AI sector, corporate earnings, and most importantly, an overdue consolidation correction.\nOn September 3, JP Morgan reported that investors must not expect the cutting cycle to provide a fresh start to stocks. Leading strategists at the firm suggested that the rate cut cycle is rather reactive and is in response to a wilting economy, having little to no impact on stocks. Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy, on the other hand, suggested that the market environment today resembles the market in 1995, increasing hopes for a market upside amid stable GDP strength and forecasts.\nBear market or bull market, certain stocks deserve a place in every investor\u2019s portfolio. These are long-term opportunities to hold and will continue to provide superior returns, as they have for decades.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 safe stocks to invest in now, we looked for well-established companies in the energy, finance, healthcare, technology, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industries. These stocks have a history of performing well and boasting consistent financial results, making them ideal and safe long term investments for beginners. We then picked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by money managers and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK) executives have recently made significant sales of the company\u2019s stock, raising questions about the market\u2019s valuation. The sales, which come amid a historic market cap milestone, could indicate a shift in the company\u2019s outlook.\nWhat Happened: On Monday, it was revealed that Ajit Jain, the insurance chief at Berkshire Hathaway for nearly four decades, sold over half of his Berkshire stake, amounting to $139 million. This marked Jain\u2019s largest stock sale since joining the company in 1986.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nGeneral Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\nThese sales, which occurred as Berkshire\u2019s Class A stock closed above $700,000 for the first time and the company reached a $1 trillion market cap, have led some to speculate that Jain may be signaling that Berkshire shares are no longer undervalued.\nAccording to Steve Check, founder of Check Capital Management, \u201cI think Ajit sold because the stock was fully pricing the business,\u201d reported CNBC.\nThis view is further supported by Berkshire\u2019s minimal buyback activity, which suggests that even Warren Buffett may share Jain\u2019s perspective on valuations. Earlier this year, the legendary investor also urged caution, noting that his vast empire may only slightly outperform the average American company due to its size and limited impactful investment opportunities.\nTrending: The startup behind White Castle's favorite Robot Fry Cook announces a next-generation fast food robot \u2013 Here's how to get a share for under $5 today.\n\u201cWith our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation and, more important, should also operate with materially less risk of permanent loss of capital,\" Buffett stated in his annual letter.\nBuffett has also been reducing his stakes in some of his favorite stocks, including Bank of America and Apple.

This has led to speculation that Buffett might buy more shares, although he is unlikely to take over the company.\nBuffett has also been reducing his stake in Bank of America, selling nearly $7 billion worth of shares since mid-July.

        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) is one of the greatest investments of all time.\nIf you had put $1,000 into the company nearly 60 years ago when Warren Buffett took over the company and kept it there, you would have more than $44 million today. Not many stocks can beat that record.\nBuffett has earned his reputation as the greatest investor of all time. Berkshire has grown to a market value of more than $1 trillion, not through any brilliant innovation or brand advantage, but through Buffett's disciplined investing approach and market-beating strategies.\nBuffett has excelled both as a stock investor, making billions from stocks like Apple, and as an acquirer of companies such as GEICO, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and Precision Castparts.\nCombining those two investment techniques, Buffett has built his conglomerate into an empire of wide-moat businesses that can survive and thrive no matter what happens in the economy.\nBerkshire's capital allocation strategy is also unique. Unlike most companies of its size, especially slow-growing ones like Berkshire, it does not pay a dividend.\nInvestors have long understood that capital allocation approach as a trade-off that's in their best interest as it gives Buffett more capital to work with to invest in stocks or go elephant hunting, his term for making a big acquisition.\nAs an investor, Buffett seems to prefer dividend stocks as nearly all of his top holdings offer a payout, and he has traditionally preferred reliable value stocks over growth stocks, which are less likely to pay dividends.\nBuffett later called the one time his company paid a dividend, in 1967, \"a terrible mistake,\" implying that that capital would have been better off being reinvested in the company.\nHe also has a test he likes to apply to dividends, saying, \"The test about whether to pay dividends is whether you can continue to create more than $1 of value for every dollar you retain.\"\nInvestors are unlikely to ever demand a dividend from Buffett. They simply have too much respect for him, and his argument against paying one has clearly been borne out by his track record.\nHowever, the argument for Berkshire to pay one seems to be getting more credible. The larger the company gets, the harder it becomes for it to make needle-moving acquisitions, something Buffett has acknowledged several times.\nIn his most recent shareholder letter, Buffett noted that the days of it having plenty of acquisition targets to choose from \"are long behind us,\" adding, \"size did us in.\" Buffett also said, \"There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire.\"\nAt the same time as Buffett seems to be bowing out of the acquisitions game, Berkshire's cash hoard has also surged over the last year, becoming far larger than at any time in its history.\nBuffett's conglomerate now holds $277 billion in cash and Treasury bills, and that sum has soared recently.\nThat cash balance, which surged in part because of a large sale of Apple stock, could signal that Buffett is preparing for a big acquisition or investment, but it could also mean that he thinks the market is overvalued. In that case, he'd rather bide his time and wait for a pullback to scoop up bargains than overpay for a stock or a company.\nAt 94 now, Buffett won't be running Berkshire forever. Its next CEO (said to be Greg Abel) will have a harder time defending the lack of a dividend, especially with nearly $300 billion in cash on the balance sheet and limited acquisition opportunities.\nEven the argument that Buffett consistently crushes the market isn't as salient as it once was. Over the past 10 years, Berkshire's performance has essentially matched the S&P 500 on a total return basis (see chart below).\nTaking that chart into account and Buffett's own admission that his company essentially has no more needle-moving acquisitions to make, the argument for superior capital returns from Berkshire doesn't really hold the same weight.\nWith his company now worth $1 trillion, Buffett has beaten the final boss of investing. There's little more he can do at this point it seems, and holding investor cash in Treasuries seems less desirable for them than returning some of that wealth in the form of a dividend so that they can spend it or invest it as they see fit.\nBerkshire could make one more big deal with Buffett at the helm, but it looks increasingly unlikely.\nAt one point it would've been unthinkable for Berkshire to pay a dividend, but times have changed. I wouldn't expect the company to pay a dividend while Buffett is still in the CEO's chair, but it makes sense to pay one eventually, probably within the next 10 years.\nBerkshire, which has been throwing billions at share buybacks in recent years, can easily afford to pay a dividend, and doing so would be the best way to reward investors who have stuck with Buffett over the years.\nDoing so isn't undermining Buffett's legacy. It's honoring it. Letting investors share in Berkshire's massive winnings without having to sell their stock is a testament to both Buffett's long-term philosophy and shareholder-friendly approach to capital.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) is a top stock for many long-term investors. It's led by the famed investor Warren Buffett, it owns a diverse mix of businesses, and it's outperformed the S&P 500 annually on average ever since its IPO in 1980.\nThat's why it was alarming when Ajit Jain, who served as Berkshire's insurance chief for nearly four decades, recently liquidated more than half of his shares for $139 million. That marked Jain's biggest stock sale since he joined the company in 1986. Jain still holds $112 million in shares through his personal holdings, trusts, and a nonprofit foundation.\nThat sale occurred around the same time Berkshire's Class A shares set a new record high of $715,910 on Sept. 3, which propelled its market cap past $1 trillion for the first time ever. Its shares have pulled back about 4% since then and reduced its value to about $990 billion. So should Berkshire's investors follow Jain's lead and take some profits off the table?\nJain didn't publicize or explain his big stock sale, but there could be a few simple explanations. He's 73 years old, so he could be retiring soon. Jain was once considered a potential successor to Warren Buffett, but Buffett plans to pass the torch to Greg Abel, who currently leads Berkshire's energy and non-insurance businesses.\nBuffett celebrated his 94th birthday last month, so he could step down in the near future. Jain, like many of Berkshire's longtime investors, might consider that to be an end of an era and the perfect time to cash in some shares.\nJain also might think Berkshire's stock and the broader market are overvalued. Berkshire's stock price has more than doubled over the past five years, and it isn't cheap at 26 times last year's operating earnings (which Buffett uses as his preferred profitability metric instead of its net income or earnings per share). Five years ago, it was trading at 21 times its trailing operating earnings for 2018.\nAs for the S&P 500, it's also historically expensive at 22 times forward earnings. That might also be why Berkshire has been selling a lot of its top stocks -- including Apple and Bank of America -- and raising more cash.\nTherefore, Jain's sale doesn't necessarily mean Berkshire's business is in trouble. It could simply be driven by some personal decisions or a belief that the stock's near-term gains are limited.\nLast year, Berkshire Hathaway generated 40% of its operating earnings from its insurance underwriting and insurance investment subsidiaries. The remaining 60% came from its other subsidiaries across the railroad, utility, energy, and consumer staples sectors. Its operating earnings notably don't include gains or losses from its closely watched investment portfolio of more than 50 stocks and ETFs, since those numbers can fluctuate wildly from year to year.\nBerkshire's main strategy is to tap its core businesses to generate fresh cash for its investment portfolio. That strategy works because its core subsidiaries are cash-rich businesses, and Buffett excels at picking long-term winning stocks for its portfolio. Some investors might wonder if Berkshire can keep making the right investments if Buffett retires, but his successors probably won't stray too far from his strategy of picking value stocks and blue chip stalwarts over high-growth plays.\nIn 2023, the growth of Berkshire's insurance businesses offset the macro headwinds for most of its non-insurance businesses, and its total operating earnings grew by 21%. Its non-insurance businesses should grow faster this year as interest rates decline.\nBerkshire ended the second quarter of 2024 with a record $276.9 billion in cash and equivalents, so it's clearly keeping some powder dry for more investments and acquisitions in case the market pulls back from its historic highs. Therefore, it might be bracing for some short-term pain -- but it's getting ready to plant the seeds for some more long-term gains.\nBerkshire Hathaway has consistently beat the market, and I don't expect that trend to change anytime soon. Ajit Jain's sale suggests its stock is approaching a near-term high, but it should still generate bigger gains over the next few years.\nBerkshire Hathaway is a stock built to generate long-term gains, so investors shouldn't fret too much over its insider sales, fluctuating valuations, or other short-term trading signals. Instead, they should appreciate its diversification, flexibility, and ability to keep growing regardless of the macroeconomic challenges.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Significantly high institutional ownership implies Berkshire Hathaway's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership\n Insider ownership in Berkshire Hathaway is 15%\nEvery investor in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 58% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\nLast week\u2019s 3.6% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 31%.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Berkshire Hathaway.\n Check out our latest analysis for Berkshire Hathaway \nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Berkshire Hathaway. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Berkshire Hathaway's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Berkshire Hathaway. With a 14% stake, CEO Warren Buffett is the largest shareholder. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 6.9% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 5.0% by the third-largest shareholder.\nA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 25 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.\nResearching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Berkshire Hathaway Inc.. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful US$152b stake in this US$1.0t business. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. \nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 27% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\nI find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway B (BRK.B) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this company have returned -3% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.4% change. The Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry, to which Berkshire Hathaway B belongs, has gained 0.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Berkshire Hathaway B is expected to post earnings of $4.57 per share, indicating a change of -7.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.72 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14.8%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.99 indicates a change of +1.4% from what Berkshire Hathaway B is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Berkshire Hathaway B is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Berkshire Hathaway B, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $96.62 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $368.44 billion and $374.84 billion estimates indicate +1.1% and +1.7% changes, respectively.\nBerkshire Hathaway B reported revenues of $93.65 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. EPS of $5.38 for the same period compares with $4.62 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $97.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.75%. The EPS surprise was +11.39%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBerkshire Hathaway B is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Berkshire Hathaway B. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Maham Fatima ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Fortune 500 Stocks To Buy Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against the other Fortune 500 stocks.\nThe aggregate revenue of the Fortune 500 companies in 2023 reached a record $41 trillion, up 0.1% year-over-year. Profits also rose 2% after declining earlier in 2022. The US took the lead from Greater China with the most companies on the Fortune 500 list for the first time since 2018. It has 139 companies as of August this year, an increase of 3 from 2023, while Greater China has 133 companies, down 9 from last year.\nThe financial sector, including banks and insurance companies, led all industries with the most Fortune 500 companies. Collectively tech giants brought in $282 billion in net income, up from $233 billion the previous year. Currently, 13 companies are making their Fortune 500 debut, reflecting the world's fascination with AI and weight-loss drugs.\nWhile the S&P 500 has recovered most of its losses, the rebound is being led by sectors like real estate, utilities, and consumer staples rather than major tech companies. Investors are shifting focus due to concerns over economic growth and expectations of Fed rate cuts.\nStill, it seems like investors think that while investment portfolios should be diversified given the current economic conditions, this sentiment does not imply divesting from tech stocks, which of course contribute greatly to the aggregate Fortune 500 revenue. Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management head of Americas Asset Allocation, emphasized this sentiment and we covered this earlier in our article about the 10 Best Tech Stocks To Buy Right Now Under $10:\n\u201c...investors should view potential dips in tech stocks as good long-term buying opportunities, as 10% corrections are historically good entry points in tech... He thinks that this market volatility is acyclical. The recent sell-off in the tech sector was not primarily due to economic concerns but rather to sector-specific issues. Despite this, tech giants will continue to benefit from the AI CapEx investment story. While there may be short-term challenges, the long-term outlook for these companies remains positive... Draho also cautioned against over-concentrating portfolios in the sector. He suggested diversifying exposure by investing in sector leaders as well as companies likely to benefit from tech disruption as a way to manage potential downside risks in tech stocks.\u201d\nJust last week, Dan Greenhaus, Solus Alternative Asset Management's chief strategist discussed markets, and the rebound's staying power, all while suggesting that predicting the Fed's next move had become more difficult.\nHe discussed the ongoing recession concerns, particularly after negative comments from financial representatives. Despite these worries, he believes the US consumer is performing well, the economy is stable, and corporate profits are exceeding expectations. This context suggests that the recent sell-off in certain AI stocks was followed by a justified rebound, as issues appear limited to recent trends.\nThe S&P 500 is currently facing resistance around the 5,600 level, a key point of concern for investors. Dan Greenhaus noted that the recent inversion of the yield curve raised anxiety but the 2-10-year curve is slightly positive. Despite these worries, credit spreads for investment-grade bonds remain stable, and overall cross-asset indicators suggest a stable market environment.\nRecently, discussions around potential interest rate changes have gained momentum, particularly following insights from Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon. He indicated a likely 25 basis point cut by the Federal Reserve, although he also acknowledged the possibility of a 50 basis point reduction. Greenhaus believes the Fed will opt for a 25 basis point cut, marking the start of a series of reductions. This perspective is supported by the normalization of inflation and a slowing economy.\nAccording to Greenhaus, the cyclical components of the stock market appear to be performing well, indicating that the overall economic fundamentals remain robust, and there is no concrete case for any specific rate cut scenario. As Fortune 500 companies continue to generate record revenues and profits as well, investor sentiments should not be shifting drastically. With that being said, we're here with a list of 10 best Fortune 500 stocks to buy now.\nMethodology\nWe first looked at the list of Fortune 500 companies, as of 2024. We then selected 10 stocks from these Fortune 500 companies that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of insurance professionals in a boardroom overlooking a city skyline.\nMarket Capitalization as of September 14: $965.85 billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 120\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is a multinational conglomerate holding company, known for its diverse investments in insurance, manufacturing, retail, and utilities.\nIt's the world's most profitable insurance company. Its portfolio includes major brands like Geico, Duracell, and Dairy Queen. The company's core insurance operations generate substantial investable cash, which Warren Buffett utilizes for delivering impressive returns.\nRecently, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) entered the LNG market by acquiring Dominion Energy's share of the Cove Point LNG export plant in Maryland in 2023. With the LNG market expected to boom over the next 5 years (projected to grow 5x from 2024 to 2028), Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s (NYSE:BRK-A) stock is certainly one to watch.\nIn Q2 2024, revenue was $93.65 billion, improving 1.24% year-over-year. The earnings per share was $5.38. With a track record of strategic acquisitions, this stock is an attractive choice for investors seeking stability and long-term growth.\nOverall BRK-B ranks 5th on our list of the best Fortune 500 stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of BRK-B as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 14 Best 52-Week High Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against the other 52-week high stocks.\nThe U.S. stock market has been on a roll, with major indices clocking double-digit gains even with the U.S. economy showing signs of weakness. The gains have come from investors shrugging off the uncertainty around the U.S. presidential election and monetary policy to continue betting on various counters.\nConsequently, the S&P 500 is already up more than 17% for the year, driven by gains in the communication services and financial services sectors. Likewise, technology stocks have also contributed to driving the overall market high as investors continue paying close attention to some of the big plays around artificial intelligence.\nREAD ALSO: 18 Best 52-Week Low Stocks to Buy Now According to Short Sellers and Top 10 ADR Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nThe tech-heavy NASDAQ index, which gained 18% for the year, comes on growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve has hit the peak of its monetary policy tightening spree. With expectations that the central bank will start cutting interest rates by as much as 50 basis points, according to CNBC, investors' sentiments around tech stocks have improved significantly for September.\nInvestors remain optimistic about the stock market outlook heading into year end because of the positive impact of low interest rates. The Fed's cutting interest rates will result in a significant drop in borrowing costs, which bodes well for capital-intensive businesses looking to access cheap capital.\nThe central bank aims to achieve a soft landing for the economy. In this situation, inflation must return to the 2% goal without the U.S. economy sliding into a downturn. If the central bank reduces interest rates prematurely, it faces the danger of a severe surge in inflation. Conversely, if it reduces rates too late, it might cause a severe recession.\nWhile interest rate cuts are expected to offer a much-needed boost, disappointing earnings, and lackluster guidance could curtail market gains, especially for the best 52-week high stocks to buy, according to short sellers.\nSeveral companies are under immense pressure after their valuation skyrocketed amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Consequently, any concerns about slow earnings and revenue growth should send jitters, triggering significant pullbacks.\nAdam Turnquist, the head of technical strategy at LPL Financial, mentioned that the S&P 500 typically experiences about three annual declines of at least 5%. On average, it has seen around one 10% decline each year.\n\"Expressing this data another way, 94% of years since 1928 have experienced a pullback of at least 5%, and 64% of years have had at least one 10% correction,\" Turnquist said, according to USA Today. \"We believe that how common these occurrences are should provide comfort to equity investors, allowing them to be patient.\"\nLooking forward to the rest of the year, experts predict that the best 52-week high stocks to buy, according to short sellers, could keep rising, but they caution about the dangers of premium valuations.\nAt the same time, financial experts believe that although economic expansion will slow down in the next few months, they don't see a situation that could cause a recession.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the best 52-week high stocks to buy now, according to short sellers, we first screened for stocks that were trading near their 52-week highs (0-10% range) using the Finviz stock screener. Next, we looked at their short interest and picked the stocks with the lowest short interest that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in descending order based on their short interest.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "Title": "Berkshire Hathaway Joins the Trillion-Dollar Club: A Deeper Dive Into the Insurance Industry",
        "Author": "  Wall Street Horizon ",
        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (BRK.B0 became the first non-tech-related company to join the trillion-dollar market cap club late last month, just as Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) turned 94 years old.[1] The Oracle of Omaha apparently hasn't lost his touch, despite some criticisms that Apple (AAPL) took up an outsized portion of Berkshire's portfolio in recent years.[2] The latest hot topic surrounding the largest company in the financials sector is its cash pile now almost 30% of Berkshire's market cap and about 26% of its total assets.[3]\nPropelling the stock to all-time highs has been ongoing bullish fervor in the insurance industry. Buffett made news shortly after Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in May, noting that Chubb (NYSE:CB) was the mystery stock being accumulated.[4] That turned out to be a sage move as shares of the Switzerland-based property and casualty firm are up more than 15% in the last four months, outpacing the S&P 500 over that span.[5]\nThe insurance space has been more active over the past 12 months; just take a look at the iShares U.S. Insurance ETF (IAK). Each of the fund's top 10 positions is up at least 24% since September 2023. Chubb is higher by 43% while the biggest weight, Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR), has returned 87%, dividends included.[6]\nWe noted strength among insurance equities back in the second quarter shortly after the release of the May CPI report. Unlike the Magnificent Seven names, these value-style stocks usually don't capture the spotlight. What's more, amid the tech selloff since the middle of July, IAK has kept on climbing.\nBoom times for insurance stocks probably isn't too shocking to hear if you're a homeowner and commuter (particularly if you have teenage drivers under your roof). Insurance premiums remain a notable driver of whatever inflation is left in the domestic economy, though like overall consumer prices, the rate of increase has fallen in the last handful of months.[7] It turns out that Americans are shopping around at the highest pace on record as a result, and we'll hear updates on the state of the insurance market later this week and next through two monthly interim reports.[8]\nProgressive issues its monthly sales update this Friday. Then on Monday, Sept. 13, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) posts its August Service Level report. These sorts of monthly views are particularly important between earnings seasons the next quarterly report of significance from the insurance industry will be from Progressive, to possibly occur on Thursday, Oct. 10 (unconfirmed). Travelers (NYSE:TRV), Chubb, The Hartford (NYSE:HIG), Allstate, MetLife (NYSE:MET) and Prudential (NYSE:PRU) all have third-quarter earnings reports over the second half of next month.\nMomentum can of course turn on a dime, but data from Morningstar reveal that IAK's top 10 holdings generally trade with low price-earnings ratios; just PGR has a P/E above 16.[9] Investors should not expect tech-like earnings multiples, however.[10] Insurance companies tend to see steadier sales and profit trajectories, resulting in more subdued expectations and less overall cyclicality.\nInsurance stocks chug to new highs as the S&P 500 stalls\nSource: Stockcharts.com\nAnother aspect of insurance companies is that their cost of goods sold is often not known until months or even years down the road. If premiums are on the increase, we can see that almost in real-time (or at least monthly), but if a few impactful catastrophes take place in a short period later on, then profitability can slip quickly.\nTake hurricane season as an example. This week marks the peak of tropical activity, climatologically speaking. It has been a calm year for hurricanes, sans Hurricane Beryl back in June, despite forecasts that pointed to a potentially record-breaking season.[11] All it takes is one storm to wreak havoc for insurers and hurricanes are just one type of climate-related risk to weigh.\nBigger picture, paying attention to what corporate executives and industry experts forecast regarding natural disaster trends is arguably more important than ever. Through early August, 19 weather/climate events have resulted in losses exceeding $1 billion in 2024, significantly above the inflation-adjusted average of 8.50 events, per NOAA.[12] Hurricanes are indeed a culprit, but so too are severe storms, wildfires, winter storms, flooding and even droughts and heat waves.\nWe will discuss the topic of physical climate risks in detail at our upcoming Data Minds webinar. Be sure to join us on Sept. 26 for an event on the impact of physical climate risk in business, where industry experts will discuss data-driven approaches with respect to the potential costs of asset damage, business disruption, supply chain issues and other critical impacts in enterprise and portfolio risk management.\nThe reality is that momentum has shifted in markets away from growth stocks just as we hit a notoriously volatile calendar stretch. Interim data points, such as those from Progressive and Allstate, can provide important clues on the state of the global economy. It is also a busy time for conferences, so stay tuned to what key events could bring about volatility in markets.\n1 Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway hits $1 trillion market value, first U.S. company outside of tech to do so, CNBC, Yun Li, August 28, 2024, https://www.cnbc.com2 Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway Trims Its Massive Stake in Apple, The Wall STreet Journal, Karen Langley, February 14, 2024, https://www.wsj.com3 Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway sells more Bank of America, has now cut stake by nearly 15%, CNBC, Alex Crippen, August 31, 2024, https://www.cnbc.com4 Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway reveals insurer Chubb as confidential stock it's been buying, CNBC, Yun Li, May 15, 2024, https://www.cnbc.com5 Progressive Corp, StockCharts, September 5, 2024, http://stockcharts.com6 iShares US Insurance, Morningstar, September 5, 2024, https://www.morningstar.com7 Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: Tenants' and Household Insurance in U.S. City Average, Federal Reserve Bank St. Louis, August 14, 2024, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/8 Americans Shop Around for Insurance More Than Ever as Costs Soar, Bloomberg, Alexandre Tanzi, August 28, 2024, https://www.bloomberg.com9 iShares US Insurance ETF, Morningstar, September 5, 2024, https://www.morningstar.com10 iShares US Insurance ETF, Morningstar, September 5, 2024, https://www.morningstar.com11 NOAA Predicts the Most Hurricanes That It Has Ever Forecast, The Wall Street Journal, Eric Niiler, May 23, 2024, https://www.wsj.com12 Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters, NCEI, August 8, 2024, https://www.ncei.noaa.gov?/\nCopyright 2024 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.

Also pleasing for shareholders was the 12% gain in the last three months.\nWhile this past week has detracted from the company's five-year return, let's look at the recent trends of the underlying business and see if the gains have been in alignment.\n Check out our latest analysis for Berkshire Hathaway \nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Berkshire Hathaway achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 17% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This free interactive report on Berkshire Hathaway's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.\nIt's nice to see that Berkshire Hathaway shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 25% over the last year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 17% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified   1 warning sign for Berkshire Hathaway  that you should be aware of.\nWe will like Berkshire Hathaway better if we see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued stocks (mostly small caps) with considerable, recent, insider buying.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Jonathan Stempel ",
        "Text": "By Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) -Berkshire Hathaway will take full ownership of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, after Warren Buffett's conglomerate agreed to acquire the 8% it did not already own from the family of late billionaire philanthropist Walter Scott.\nAccording to a Tuesday regulatory filing, Berkshire Hathaway Energy will pay $2.37 billion in cash for about 4.42 million of its shares.\nThe Scott family will also swap 1.6 million of the energy unit's shares for an unspecified number of Berkshire Class B shares. Berkshire Hathaway Energy is also exchanging some debt.\nFollowing the transaction, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire will own 100% of the energy unit, up from 92% now.\nThe transaction is expected to be completed after regulatory approvals in the current quarter. Its total value is unclear because the energy unit's shares are not publicly traded.\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy declined additional comment, while Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nScott, an Omaha native, was a longtime Berkshire director and Buffett friend who died in Sept. 2021 at age 90.\nAnalysts had expected Berkshire to buy out Scott's family, though Edward Jones' analyst James Shanahan said it took longer than expected.\nIn June 2022, Berkshire Vice Chairman Greg Abel, who led Berkshire Hathaway Energy for a decade, sold his 1% stake to Berkshire for $870 million. That suggested that the Scott family's stake was worth nearly $7 billion at the time.\nBut the energy unit's PacifiCorp utility has since faced many lawsuits from homeowners and business owners who blame it for causing wildfires in Oregon and northern California in 2020.\nThe purchase also lets Berkshire spend some of its cash, which totaled $276.9 billion as of June 30.\n\"It makes sense,\" said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. \"Berkshire has a significant pile of cash to deploy, at a time U.S. Treasury yields are falling and likely to continue to fall.\"\nShe said the energy unit nonetheless \"has had its fair amount of challenges since Abel sold his stake, not the least of which is the wildfire litigation.\"\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy owns energy, utility and pipeline businesses, and one of the largest U.S. residential real estate brokerages.\nBuffett's conglomerate originally bought a 76% stake in 2000, when the unit was known as MidAmerican Energy. The unit adopted the Berkshire Hathaway Energy name in 2014.\nBerkshire also owns dozens of other businesses, including the BNSF railroad and Geico car insurance, and common stocks including Apple.\nAbel, 62, is expected to eventually succeed Buffett, 94, as Berkshire's chief executive.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n"

The company's insurance revenue provides much of the ammunition for Buffett\u2019s purchases of stocks and whole corporations.\nBloomberg/Getty Images\nJain, who turns 73 on Sept. 15, has played a major role in Berkshire\u2019s success in catastrophe insurance. He began at Berkshire in 1985 and was named vice chairman in 2018. Buffett is the chairman.\n\u201cAjit insures risks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on,\u201d the Oracle of Omaha wrote in his 2017 letter to shareholders. Buffett lives in Omaha.\n\u201cHis operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources.\u201d\nThough he came to Berkshire as a raw rookie in insurance, Jain was \u201chanded the keys to our small and struggling reinsurance business,\u201d Buffett said.\nRelated: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway just joined exclusive club\n\u201cSince then, Ajit has created tens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders. If there were ever to be another Ajit, and you could swap me for him, don\u2019t hesitate. Make the trade!\u201d\nDespite his affection for Jain, Buffett has named Berkshire\u2019s other vice chairman, Greg Abel, his successor. That may have something to do with Abel\u2019s age\u2014he\u2019s 62, 10 years younger than Jain, while Buffett is 94.\nJain put his money where his desk was at Berkshire, buying stock with his own funds to become one of the company\u2019s biggest individual shareholders.\nRelated: Warren Buffett buys a beautifully cheap stock\nBut now he has taken advantage of the stock\u2019s surge to book some serious profits. Berkshire shares jumped 58% over the past two years, and its market capitalization breached $1 trillion last month.\nJain sold 200 Class A Berkshire\u00a0 (BRK.A) \u00a0shares Sept. 9 at $695,418 a piece, giving him a kitty of $139 million, according to a regulatory filing.\nThe sale represented 55% of his stake: Jain still controls 166 shares. Of that total, he holds 61 directly and 105 through trusts and his non-profit Jain Foundation.\nYou might wonder what kind of signal is sent about the company with Jain selling so many shares. But news of the move hasn\u2019t hurt Berkshire shares. They slid just 0.5% on Sept. 12, the day after the news came out.\nMore Warren Buffett:\nVeteran fund manager views Warren Buffett moves as worrisome\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway just joined exclusive club\nAnalysts reset Ulta stock price targets after Warren Buffett buy\nSo why exactly did Jain sell Berkshire shares? There could be any number of reasons, including estate planning. The stock dump may not reflect his outlook on Berkshire at all.\nSome experts say it might be a sign that Jain is headed out the Berkshire door.\n\"Those of us who have watched Berkshire Hathaway for a long time have suspected there may be a changing of the guard in insurance operations,\u201d Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research, told Reuters.\n\"My sense is that he may be moving on, and I suspect that is behind his stock sales.\u201d She has a buy rating on Berkshire stock.\nThe author owns shares of Berkshire Hathaway.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager who correctly forecast stock drop updates outlook\n"

        "Text": "If you're in the market for dividend income, good for you! It's hard to beat the power of dividend investing. Not only do you get a regular stock that will, ideally, grow in value over time, but it will also regularly plunk extra dollars into your investment account.\nIf you're retired, that retirement income can come in very handy -- without requiring you to shave off any shares. If you're a pre-retiree, you might just reinvest those dividends into more shares of stock. Better still, healthy and growing dividend-paying companies will generally increase their payouts over time.\nIt's reasonable to wonder whether Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) would be a good dividend-paying stock for you. It's certainly a terrific stock to own. It specializes in insurance, energy, and transportation, and encompasses many businesses owned outright (such as GEICO, Benjamin Moore, Dairy Queen, McLane, and the entire BNSF railroad), along with sizable chunks of other companies (such as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Bank of America).\nHere's the catch, though: Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend!\nBuffett does love dividends, though. Thanks to the shares of stock owned by Berkshire, the company collects more than $5 billion in dividend income annually. So why no dividends from the company? Well, remember that when a company earns income, it can do many things with it. It might use that money to fuel growth -- and that's why many young, faster-growing companies opt not to pay dividends. It might alternatively pay down debts, acquire other companies, buy investments, or repurchase shares. Buffett does like to repurchase shares when they seem undervalued to him, and he's famous for buying other businesses when he finds ones he likes available at a great or good price.\nBuffett has explained that, essentially, when Berkshire has more cash than can be deployed in useful ways, it might initiate a dividend. But that might not happen for a long time. For now, the company was recently sitting on about $277 billion in cash!\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Invest In According to Short Sellers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against the other blue chip stocks.\nWhile economic data may be scarce, every data point gives a new angle to the ever-uncertain economic conditions in the US. On September 12, Jason Draho, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Asset Allocation, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the market moves after the consumer price index (CPI) report was released on Wednesday.\nDraho suggested how regular intra-day moves did not hold enough weight to impact or influence the Fed\u2019s decision. However, he did acknowledge that the inflation data and Wall Street\u2019s reaction to it make the case for a 25-basis cut, or more, in the upcoming Fed meeting.\nDraho then hinted that investors are hoping for a soft landing and are looking for stronger reasons or economic cues to hold back, given that bad economic news, as of now, has not triggered investors as much. He also emphasized the need for more financial data and clarity on whether the Fed would be proactive with its rate cuts for further analysis.\nContrary to what investors wish, he believes the Fed will be rather hawkish than proactive with its rate-cutting cycle. He adds that while the market calls for 100 basis points in rate cuts by the end of this year, he does expect the Fed to signal way less.\nHe then shed light on supply challenges in the technology sector, hinting that demand is not the issue at the moment. He was particularly impressed by the earnings posted by AI companies. Draho expects tech companies to have strong balance sheets and strong earnings power by the end of 2024, making them attractive stocks despite the economic turmoil.\nOn September 13, Andrew Krei, Crescent Grove Advisors co-chief investment officer, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to share his bullish outlook on the economy and financial markets. Krei discussed the labor market trends and how they may impact the Fed\u2019s decisions in the upcoming meeting.\nKrei pressed that despite the \u201cunwarranted\u201d volatility over the past few weeks, the economic outlook remains favorable, with credit markets showing close to no signs of stress. Krei also shed light on the global economic backdrop, suggesting that international markets, especially Europe, Japan, and China were showing strong signs of recovery in trade and manufacturing.\nAs far as investment goes, Krei suggests that while mega-cap tech stocks have shown promising results, he is more bullish on stocks outside of the magnificent 7. He was particularly inclined to companies in healthcare, finance, and industrials, hinting that these sectors will benefit immensely from the easing cycle. He then suggested that investors must shift their focus to diversified stocks with lower valuations and relatively stronger risk-adjusted returns.\nWhatever the state of the economy, some stocks are notorious for their strong and consistent financial results.\nPixabay/Public Domain\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 12 best blue chip stocks to invest in according to short sellers, we first went over multiple similar rankings, our own rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of blue chip stocks. We then found the companies with the lowest short float and ranked the top 12 with the largest number of hedge fund holders and lowest short float percentage. The stocks are sorted in descending order of their short interest.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 120\nShort % of Shares Outstanding: 0.57%\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc.

The company not only provides services across several insurance lines, but also engages in the generation and distribution of electricity from natural gas, coal, wind, solar, and nuclear sources. Berkshire Hathaway also retails household appliances, electronics, kitchenware, and motorcycle equipment.\nThe company boasts a reliable source of income from its stable operating businesses. In the second quarter of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) logged $93 billion in revenue, of which $26 billion came from insurance. In addition to that, the company has ownership rights and control over multiple major companies. According to the company\u2019s latest shareholder letter, it currently owns 6% of the entire universe in which it operates.\nInsurance underwriting and insurance investment income were the two primary segments of the company in FY 2023, reporting $5.4 billion and $9.6 billion in operating earnings, respectively. Its railroad segment was the third largest segment, with operating earnings worth $5 billion.\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is one of the best blue chip stocks and we say that because the company has strong roots in multiple industries diversifying its risk. According to our database, 120 hedge funds held stakes in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) and the\u00a0Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust\u00a0was the largest shareholder of the company, as of June 30.\nOverall BRK ranks 2nd on our list of the best blue chip stocks to invest in according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of BRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NYSE:BRK-B) stands against the other stocks recommended by ChatGPT.\nChatGPT has quickly become an essential tool for both professional and personal use, thanks to its human-like responses. Analysts are also exploring its potential for stock picking, using criteria like low P/E ratios to find undervalued stocks. While some question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, a study from the University of Florida suggests that ChatGPT can predict stock price movements more accurately than some basic analysis models.\nOpenAI recently made a major leap by launching GPT-4o, a new AI model, alongside a desktop version of ChatGPT and an updated user interface. This update brings GPT-4 to all users, including those on the free tier, with enhanced speed and capabilities in text, video, and audio. The \"o\" in GPT-4o stands for \"omni,\" indicating its ability to support 50 languages and be available via APIs, allowing developers to start building applications with the new model right away.\nThe S&P 500 and NASDAQ are on track for their tenth consecutive positive session, driven by the same bullish factors that have propelled the market throughout the year. Inflation continues to trend downward, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. This potential for rate cuts supports the market by fostering conditions that could lead to a soft economic landing.\nEd Clissold, Ned Davis Research chief U.S. strategist, told CNBC that quarterly earnings growth has consistently accelerated over the past few quarters, with Q2 showing strong results and Q3 expected to follow suit. This steady growth suggests no significant changes in the underlying market thesis, keeping investor sentiment positive.\nDespite the recent volatility seen in August, which was partly driven by a spike in market uncertainty and liquidity issues, analysts do not expect this to carry over into September. The possibility of rate cuts by the Fed is providing a solid foundation for the market, though there are some concerns about elevated earnings estimates for Q3 and the upcoming election.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is close to an all-time high, with stocks like Travelers, Boeing, and 3M leading the charge. Analysts predict a broad market advance, with potential for catch-up in sectors that have lagged behind this year. As interest rates are likely to come down, the market rally could broaden beyond just AI and mega-cap growth stocks.\nLooking ahead to next week, key economic data will be in focus, including PCE data on Friday and consumer spending insights on Tuesday. Investors are hoping for \"Goldilocks\" economic data\u2014not too hot, not too cold\u2014that would confirm the Fed's rate cut path without signaling an economic downturn. The market favors moderate economic growth, which would support continued stock market gains.\nIn a world overwhelmed by information, ChatGPT offers a solution for investors. Its natural language processing capabilities allow it to sift through vast amounts of data and provide concise, actionable summaries, helping investors make informed decisions. By reducing information costs and democratizing financial knowledge, ChatGPT is becoming an invaluable tool for individual investors.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article we prompted ChatGPT multiple times to recommend stocks, based on the data as of its knowledge cutoff date.

(NYSE:BRK-B) is becoming too expensive.\nBerkshire Hathaway holds $277 billion in cash and equivalents, providing it with significant financial flexibility and generating substantial interest income. Excluding this cash from its market value reduces it to $723 billion. Additionally, Berkshire's stock portfolio is valued at around $318 billion. Removing this value shows that the market is valuing Berkshire's core operating businesses at $405 billion.\nOver the past four quarters, Berkshire Hathaway's subsidiaries have generated $42.1 billion in operating earnings. When excluding the value of Berkshire's stock portfolio and cash, the company's core businesses are trading at roughly 9.5 times their trailing-12-month earnings. Even after removing investment income, Berkshire still reported $30.9 billion in profit, resulting in a price-to-earnings ratio of about 13. This valuation applies to a diverse set of recession-resistant businesses that have seen a 26% increase in operating earnings year-to-date in 2024.\nOverall BRK-B ranks 8th on our list of ChatGPT's recent stock recommendations. While we acknowledge the potential of BRK-B as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BRK-B but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, heck out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway B (BRK.B) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this company have returned +0.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. The Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry, to which Berkshire Hathaway B belongs, has gained 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Berkshire Hathaway B is expected to post earnings of $4.57 per share, indicating a change of -7.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.72 points to a change of +14.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.9%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.99 indicates a change of +1.4% from what Berkshire Hathaway B is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.3%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Berkshire Hathaway B is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Berkshire Hathaway B, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $96.62 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +3.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $368.44 billion and $374.84 billion estimates indicate +1.1% and +1.7% changes, respectively.\nBerkshire Hathaway B reported revenues of $93.65 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.2%. EPS of $5.38 for the same period compares with $4.62 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $97.31 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -3.75%. The EPS surprise was +11.39%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nBerkshire Hathaway B is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Berkshire Hathaway B. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Looking at Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s (NYSE:BRK.A ) insider transactions over the last year, we can see that insiders were net sellers. That is, there were more number of shares sold by insiders than there were purchased.\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n See our latest analysis for Berkshire Hathaway \nNotably, that recent sale by Ajit Jain is the biggest insider sale of Berkshire Hathaway shares that we've seen in the last year. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$671,750. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.\nThe chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of small cap stocks that are not only being bought by insiders but also have attractive valuations.\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Berkshire Hathaway. Specifically, Vice Chairman of Insurance Operations & Director Ajit Jain ditched US$139m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Berkshire Hathaway insiders own 15% of the company, currently worth about US$143b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\nAn insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Berkshire Hathaway.\nBut note: Berkshire Hathaway may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Jim Cramer Thinks You Should Check Out.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer thinks you should check out.\nJim Cramer draws an engaging parallel between fantasy football and stock investing as the NFL season begins. Cramer uses this occasion to introduce his concept of \"Fantasy Stock Football.\" He likens selecting stocks for an investment portfolio to drafting players for a fantasy football team, emphasizing how both require strategic thinking and role balancing.\n\"While you're enjoying the game, I want to get you into the NFL spirit with some Fantasy Stock Football.\"\nCramer enjoys blending real-world sports with market insights to offer a unique perspective on investing. He notes that, like fantasy football teams, investment portfolios consist of various stocks that play different roles, contributing to overall performance. Reflecting on the previous year, he highlights that the 11 stocks he recommended have risen an average of 38%, outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 23% gain. This comparison underscores his belief in the strategic approach to both fantasy football and stock selection.\n\"Now look, I love comparing real teams and real players to my favorite stocks. These are two great tastes that taste great together. More importantly, it gives me another angle to help you\u2014I\u2019ve got to teach you about the market in any way I can. Picking stocks for your portfolio has a lot in common with drafting players for your fantasy football team.\nJim Cramer highlights some key mistakes investors are making and emphasizes the importance of a strategic approach to investing. He points out that many investors are making errors by overreacting to market fluctuations and trying to time their moves poorly. According to Cramer, sometimes the best strategy is to do nothing and avoid making rash decisions.\n\"People keep making a ton of mistakes when they should really just be sitting on their hands. Sometimes the best thing you can do is absolutely nothing. Instead, they're acting out every possible fantasy nightmare when it comes to the market. Not only is it tedious and foolhardy, but it\u2019s also very expensive for anyone who's running with this non-strategy. You can see the averages, which started out like a house on fire today, only to fizzle out by the end.\"\nCramer criticizes the persistent doubts about Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. He believes Powell has managed the transition from tightening to easing policies well, despite earlier criticism for slow rate hikes. The ongoing panic over economic data\u2014whether strong or weak\u2014shows a lack of faith in Powell\u2019s ability to adjust rates appropriately. Cramer asserts that the Fed will act as needed, whether that means a 25 or 50 basis point cut, and advises investors to trust Powell\u2019s strategy rather than being swayed by market noise.\n\"There\u2019s a belief that the Federal Reserve under Jerome Powell will somehow screw up the transition as they shift from tightening to stop inflation to easing to combat recession. At this point in Powell\u2019s tenure, I find it insane that he never seems to get the benefit of the doubt. Well, yes, he started raising rates a little too late in 2022, but it\u2019s hard to blame him for that. Powell didn\u2019t want to hit the brakes on the economy when we were still dealing with a healthcare emergency, which is why he didn\u2019t tighten in 2021.\nCramer addresses skepticism around artificial intelligence (AI), arguing that it is premature to dismiss its potential. While current AI developments may not seem revolutionary, he believes that significant advancements, such as breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, indicate that AI\u2019s impact will grow over time.\n\"We\u2019ve gone from a world where artificial intelligence (AI) was supposed to solve everything to a world where AI is treated as just a robust sham, except for when ServiceNow gets one more contract, of course. At its apex, AI was supposed to make organizations much more efficient, improve gross margins magically, and create inventions vastly better than the status quo. Sadly, we don\u2019t see much of anything tangible, other than competing chatbots\u2014rivaling inquiry systems that can generate information in sentence form, including hallucinations. We\u2019re told the whole thing\u2019s a canard, and this reality has slapped true believers like me in the face.\"\nJim Cramer believes that dismissing AI as a failure is premature. He argues that people are underestimating its potential, as we are still early in discovering its practical applications. According to Cramer, recent advances in accelerated computing and generative AI have already led to significant breakthroughs, such as improvements in cancer diagnosis. While the excitement around AI in healthcare may suggest we're on the brink of a major revolution, Cramer points out that we're actually witnessing a gradual but important evolution in the technology's capabilities.\n\"Now look, I think that\u2019s just plain wrong. It\u2019s way too early to view AI as a waste. People know nothing. We\u2019re only a couple of years into finding use cases, for heaven\u2019s sake. We just got word that accelerated computing and generative AI have led to a breakthrough in cancer diagnosis, which could be very important. That\u2019s a huge thing. But the hype of what this technology could mean for healthcare seems to illustrate that we aren\u2019t seeing a revolution yet\u2014we\u2019re just seeing a faster evolution.\"\nOur Methodology\nThe article reviews a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed and recommended various stocks. It highlights ten companies that Cramer featured and explores their perception among hedge funds. The companies are ranked from the least owned to the most owned by hedge funds.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of insurance professionals in a boardroom overlooking a city skyline.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 120\nJim Cramer advises that there\u2019s never a bad time to buy Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B). He suggests purchasing some shares now and then waiting for the stock price to drop before buying more. Cramer believes Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is an excellent investment and recommends taking advantage of any opportunity to add to one\u2019s portfolio.\n\"When is it a bad time to buy Berkshire? Buy some tomorrow. I think it\u2019s terrific. Then, wait until it comes down and buy some more.\"\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) stands out as a strong investment due to its diverse portfolio, excellent financial performance, and dependable leadership under Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), which includes major businesses like GEICO, BNSF Railways, and significant stakes in giants such as Apple Inc.\n(NASDAQ:AAPL), has shown impressive results.\nIn Q2 2024, Berkshire earned $35.9 billion, up from $28.9 billion the previous year, and its operating income grew by 6.6%, thanks to improvements in insurance and energy sectors.

Jain\u2019s insider selling, coupled with the conglomerate slowing its stock repurchases and letting its cash pile swell to $277 billion, has possibly raised valuation concerns among investors.\nWhile the industrial conglomerate\u2019s more-affordable Class B stock was nearly 8% below its Sept. 4 high through Friday\u2019s close, it has still gained around 26% since the start of the year, handily outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 18% return over the same period.

This area, which lies slightly below a multi-month uptrend line and the 200-day moving average, would likely encounter support from a trendline connecting a series of price action from early February to early May.\nIf Berkshire shares find a floor at current levels and resume their longer-term uptrend, investors should monitor the $480 level, an area where investors may look to exit the stock around its record high.

        "Author": "  JOSH FUNK ",
        "Text": "OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is buying the rest of its utility unit from the estate of a longtime board member who died three years ago, but it's not clear exactly how much it will pay for that 8% stake in the massive utility business.\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that it will pay Walter Scott's family $2.4 billion cash and issue a number of Class B Berkshire shares that are equivalent to 1.6 million shares of the utility business, but since the utility's shares aren't publicly traded it is hard to estimate the total value of the deal that's expected to close later this year. Altogether, Berkshire is buying more than 4.4 million shares in the utilities to give it 100% ownership.\n\u201cThat filing left me with a number of questions, but they don\u2019t have an investor relations function so I don\u2019t expect those questions to be answered,\u201d CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said. \u201cThe hope is that when they report earnings there will be more details.\u201d\nDes Moines, Iowa-based Berkshire Hathaway Energy includes MidAmerican Energy, Pacificorp and NV Energy in Nevada and a Canadian electricity transmission provider called AltaLink, among other businesses.\nBuffett doesn't like to disclose any more than he has to, and the Berkshire Hathaway parent company didn't issue a press release or file anything with the Securities and Exchange Commission, leaving investors to speculate.\nApparently, Buffett doesn't believe this transaction is big enough to have a material impact on Berkshire Hathaway given that it just reported more than $30.3 billion in earnings and was sitting on $277 billion cash in the second quarter.\nBut a similar transaction when Berkshire bought out Vice Chairman Greg Abel's 1% stake in the utility business two years ago for $870 million suggests this deal with the Scott family is sizeable. Abel is slated to eventually replace Buffett as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO. If Berkshire agreed to pay the same price for the shares the Scott family is selling, the deal should be worth $6.96 billion.\nOf course in the past two years, one of Berkshire's biggest utilities, PacifiCorp, has paid out hundreds of millions in settlements related to wildfires in Oregon and California that damaged thousands of homes in 2020, and Berkshire Hathaway has recorded $2.7 billion in wildfire losses.\nBuffett was down on the utility industry's prospects in this year's letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. But it's not clear what the current value of the utility divisions shares are today. Buffett didn't immediately respond to questions about the deal with the Scott family, and the utility unit declined to comment beyond what is in the regulatory filing.\nIn addition to utilities, Berkshire Hathaway owns BNSF railroad, a number of large insurance companies including Geico and a varied assortment of manufacturing and retail firms that includes aviation parts maker Precision Castparts and more well-known brands like Dairy Queen and See's Candy.\n"

        "Title": "Is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway a Millionaire-Maker?",
        "Author": "  Reuben Gregg Brewer, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's a problem with mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that doesn't bedevil a traditional company. Avoiding this single issue is one of the reasons why Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has achieved such impressive success over time. Here's why this financial giant has produced so many millionaires and why it could keep doing so in the future, even after Wall Street icon Warren Buffett eventually leaves the corner office.\nIf you were to describe Berkshire Hathaway's business, some might argue that it is an insurance company. But there's a case to be made for calling it a railroad company. And a utility. And a midstream company. And a retailer, a manufacturer, and a chemical company, too. At the end of the day, it would be most appropriate to use the term \"conglomerate.\" That's because it owns businesses across all of the above sectors, and more.\nThis is a very unique business. That's the result of Warren Buffett's investment approach. To simplify things, he is looking to buy well-run companies when they are well priced. That's a lot like what you'd expect to hear if you were looking at a value-focused mutual fund or ETF. And given the broadly diversified list of businesses that Berkshire Hathaway owns, it really does appear to have a portfolio of businesses.\nIf you look at Berkshire Hathaway from this perspective, there's really no good or bad time to buy it. Sure, there are times when the stock is cheaper and times when it is more expensive, but what you are really buying is the investment approach taken by its CEO, Warren Buffett. That approach, meanwhile, has been ingrained into Berkshire Hathaway, given Buffett's long tenure at the top of the company he basically created.\nBut there's an important difference between Berkshire Hathaway and a pooled investment vehicle like a mutual fund. A mutual fund is a pass-through entity, so any dividends or capital gains generally get paid out via distributions. As a company, Berkshire Hathaway doesn't have to pass anything through to shareholders. So the cash flows these companies throw off sit on Berkshire Hathaway's balance sheet and give Buffett a cash pile that he can use to invest into more companies. That allows Berkshire Hathaway to grow over time via acquisitions, on top of the growth that is achieved in the businesses it owns.\nRight now Buffett doesn't see many opportunities for investment, so the cash pile is growing. At the end of the second quarter, Berkshire Hathaway had $36.8 billion of cash on its balance sheet and another $234.6 billion in short-term investments. That pile is set to grow materially in the third quarter thanks to big sales from the company's equity portfolio, as Buffett has taken profits in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC).\nIt looks like Buffett may be gearing up for something big. In the company's 2023 annual report, he wrote:\nThere remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can value; some we can't. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced. Outside the U.S., there are essentially no candidates that are meaningful options for capital deployment at Berkshire. All in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance.\nThat sounds bad. But it is really a time-specific statement. Buffett doesn't see anything needle-moving worth buying right now while the market is hovering near all-time highs. But if there were a bear market, that situation would likely change. The cash he is building up now could be put to good use when valuations fall, giving Berkshire Hathaway more opportunity to create additional millionaires.\nHere's the thing: Berkshire Hathaway is a long-term investment. Buffett's approach is meant to create increasing wealth over decades. And while he is likely to end his tenure as CEO sooner rather than later, the company he has built should continue to operate in a very similar manner to the way it has operated under his tutelage.\nThe best time to buy Berkshire Hathaway will probably be during a bear market, which, as it were, will likely be when the company starts investing, too. If you can stomach taking a contrarian approach, however, Berkshire Hathaway could easily help you build a seven-figure portfolio, no matter when you step aboard.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "40.5% of Warren Buffett's $312 Billion Berkshire Hathaway Portfolio Is in These 2 Dividend Stocks",
        "Author": "  Keith Noonan and Jennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Under the leadership of CEO Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway has paid a dividend to its investors just once (a $0.10 per share payout back in 1967). Instead, the company chooses to use its capital to invest in its wholly owned businesses and other companies, make new acquisitions, buy Treasury bonds, and buy back its own shares.\nWith Berkshire's stock up more than 3,976,400% since Buffett purchased a controlling stake in the company in 1965, it's hard to argue with the Oracle of Omaha's capital-allocation strategy. The stock's gains across the stretch would have turned a $1,000 investment into more than $42.5 million today.\nEven though Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend itself, Buffett is a big fan of companies that return cash to shareholders through direct payouts. In fact, each of the company's 10 largest stock holdings pays a dividend -- and its portfolio is heavily weighted toward just a handful of dividend-paying stocks. Read on for a look at the two dividend stocks that account for 40.5% of Berkshire Hathaway's $312 billion stock portfolio.\nJennifer Saibil: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was recently inducted into Buffett's hallowed trio of stocks he said he'd never sell. As it turns out, he meant that he'd never sell the full position because he sold some Apple stock immediately after he said it.\nBut that doesn't mean it's fallen out of Buffett's favor. It still accounts for roughly 28.3% of the entire Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.\nLike the other Buffett forever holdings, Apple is a dividend stock. It doesn't have a high yield -- just 0.45% at the current price, or well below the S&P 500 average of 1.3%. That's close to its lowest-ever yield, which is partially because Apple stock has been outstanding this year, gaining almost 15% year to date.\nThe dividend demonstrates several things that are important to Buffett, regardless of the yield. It's a tangible sign of Apple's commitment to creating shareholder value and means management is prioritizing its cash position, which is paramount to operating a viable and growing business. Apple has a low payout ratio of only 14.9% because it's still in a robust growth mode and uses most of its earnings for innovation and operations.\nApple has the global brand name and moat that Buffett loves, and being able to support that is a key element of sustaining its lead and edge. Apple fans are known to stick with the company's platform, trading up for new models when they're released. They're loyal to the Apple ecosystem, which is differentiated through its innovation, operating system, ease of use, and general excellence. Buffett said that Apple is an even better business than his other forever stocks, Coca-Cola and American Express (NYSE: AXP).\nIt's not surprising that Apple is beating the market this year or is back in the top spot as the most valuable company on the stock market. It's exciting investors with its advancement in artificial intelligence, and the newest iteration of the iPhone is expected to be released this month. Even though it's already minted plenty of millionaires, there's a lot more to expect from Apple stock.\nKeith Noonan: Following some significant portfolio reshuffling in the second quarter, American Express overtook Bank of America to become Berkshire's second-largest overall stock holding. The Oracle of Omaha's company owns more than 151.6 million shares of AmEx stock, and the position accounts for 12.2% of its total stock holdings.\nThe credit card-focused banking company has been serving up strong financial results, and its share price has risen roughly 58% over the last year. These big gains have also pushed down the company's dividend yield. That's not a problem for Berkshire because the company acquired the bulk of its AmEx shares at much lower prices, but is the stock still worthwhile for other income-seeking investors at today's prices?\nWhile the company's current yield of roughly 1% may not look like much, there's a good chance that shares purchased today will boast a much bigger yield down the line. American Express has increased its dividend payout by roughly 63% over the last three years and hasn't been letting up on the gas pedal when it comes to payout growth.\nWith the payout increase it announced back in March, American Express hiked its dividend by 17%. Strong financial performance has paved the way for big payout growth, and there are good reasons to expect that profit expansion will continue to facilitate rapid dividend growth.\nAmerican Express's revenue increased 8% year over year in the second quarter, and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share rose 21%, compared to the prior-year period. The company added 3.3 million new card accounts in the quarter and recorded its 24th consecutive quarter of double-digit annual growth for card fees. For the full-year period, the company expects that it will grow sales between 9% and 11%, and its midpoint guidance calls for earnings growth of roughly 21%.\nThe American Express brand and its financial products have continued to gain favor. And thanks to its focus on attracting a high-credit-quality customer base, the company also has the benefit of credit default rates that are best in class. While the stock's yield comes in below the S&P 500 index's average, it still looks like a worthwhile investment.\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s Radar.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against the other stocks on Jim Cramer's radar.\nJim Cramer often reflects on how he would reform the American education system if it were up to him. According to him, one major change would be to incorporate personal finance education into high school curriculums. He compares this to mandatory health classes that teach practical skills, like dissection, which he finds less relevant compared to financial literacy.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Cramer emphasizes that understanding money is crucial, and not caring about it doesn't make someone virtuous; rather, it can lead to real-life problems like poor credit affecting personal and financial decisions, such as buying a car or a house. He notes that while conventional wisdom says money can't buy happiness, being financially broke is undeniably challenging.\n\"If everyone in this country lost their minds and decided to turn America into Cramerica, you better believe I would make some changes. So, what would the 18th premiere of Jim Cramer look like? Hey, for those of you who didn\u2019t get that reference, Google is your best friend. But because this is a show about money, let\u2019s stick to the more mainstream elements of the Cramerican regime. For starters, it drives me nuts that we don\u2019t really teach our young people how to handle their money. Would it be so crazy if you had to take a class on personal finance before you could graduate from high school? I mean, like those awkward health classes where they show you how to dissect a frog. I mean, come on!\nReflecting on his own experiences, Cramer recalls living in a car while still managing to save for retirement, which he views as a significant accomplishment. He encourages young people to invest early to achieve financial freedom and avoid dependency on their next paycheck. Through the CNBC Investing Club, he aims to guide young investors in managing their finances effectively.\n\"These things matter in life. They say money can't buy happiness, but I've always found that piece of cliche conventional wisdom to be dubious at best. Because, hey, listen, being broke is a major buzzkill, as I know firsthand from the time I spent living in my '78 Ford Fairmont for six months in California. I wish I had an expert to guide me through all this stuff back then. Although I still put money away for retirement while living in my car, I took it out of my homeowner's budget.\nJim Cramer observes that many people begin saving and investing too late, complicating their financial lives more than necessary as they age. He also notes that younger individuals often feel they have plenty of time, sometimes starting to invest before they\u2019re truly prepared. Cramer believes there are more prudent uses for their money at that stage.\n\"Too many people start saving and investing too late, making their lives a lot more difficult than they need to be as they get older. But I also know many young people feel that they have all the time in the world. Some start investing before they're truly ready when there are, in fact, better things for them to do with their money.\"\nCramer then offers three key lessons for young investors, especially recent college graduates. First, he stresses the importance of saving money, even if it\u2019s not intuitive. He suggests investing in the stock market as a way to save, which can be more engaging than just keeping money in a savings account or CD. Investing helps keep your money from being spent impulsively because accessing it requires selling stocks.\nSecond, Cramer advises young investors to embrace higher risk in their portfolios. In their 20s, they can afford to take risks with speculative stocks or options because they have many years to recover from mistakes. In contrast, older investors should adopt more conservative strategies, focusing on safer investments like bonds and utilities. Cramer criticizes the idea of young investors holding a significant percentage of bonds, emphasizing that they should be more aggressive in their investments.\nLastly, Cramer challenges the notion that student loan debt should prevent young people from investing. He notes that student loan interest rates are generally lower than credit card debt and advises starting investments even while managing student loans. He also suggests that delaying student loan payments could be advantageous due to potential future loan forgiveness programs.\n\"Here\u2019s the bottom line for young people just out of college: investing is a great way to trick yourself into saving money you might otherwise spend. Beyond that, remember when you're young, you can afford to take a lot more risk with your portfolio. It's never too soon to start contributing to your 401k or IRA, especially an IRA.\"\nOur Methodology\nThis article reviews a recent edition of Jim Cramer's Morning Thoughts, where he covered various stocks. We highlight ten prominent companies he mentioned and analyze how hedge funds view these stocks. The article ranks these companies based on their level of hedge fund ownership, from the least to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

He recalls that Leon Cooperman first introduced him to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) in the early 1980s, and the stock has continued to show positive performance since then. Cramer highlights that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) remains a strong investment choice today.\n\"Berkshire Hathaway is what I call an up stock. It's been that way since Leon Cooperman first told me about it in 1983 and '84, and it remains an up stock even today.\"\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is a strong investment due to its diverse portfolio and financial stability. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) spans various sectors, including insurance with GEICO, energy through Berkshire Hathaway Energy, railroads with BNSF Railway, and consumer goods like Duracell and See\u2019s Candies. This broad diversification reduces risk and provides steady revenue streams, allowing Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) to thrive in different economic conditions.\nIts insurance operations generate significant cash flow, which Warren Buffett uses for strategic investments, supporting long-term growth. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B)'s investment portfolio includes major stakes in top-performing companies like Apple Inc.\n(NASDAQ:AAPL) and\nThe Coca-Cola Company\n(NYSE:KO), enhancing stability and growth potential. Warren Buffett\u2019s proven investment strategy, combined with a strong balance sheet and over $100 billion in cash, gives Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) flexibility for acquisitions and share buybacks.\nOverall BRK-B ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of stocks on Jim Cramer's radar. While we acknowledge the potential of BRK-B as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Jain sold 200 Berkshire Class A shares on Monday for approximately $139 million.\nWhat Happened: This sale represents around 55% of Jain\u2019s total stake in the conglomerate. He now retains 61 Berkshire shares personally, 55 shares in a family trust, and 50 in the Jain Foundation.

        "Title": "Warren Buffett gets early birthday present as Berkshire Hathaway joins $1 trillion club",
        "Author": "  Greg McKenna ",
        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway reached a $1 trillion market capitalization Wednesday morning, becoming the first non-technology company in the U.S. to do so. The milestone amounts to an early birthday present for chairman Warren Buffett, who turns 94 on Friday.\nThe conglomerate\u2019s Class A shares initially rose over 1% Wednesday and hit an all-time high above the $699,000 mark, allowing Berkshire to temporarily crack the $1 trillion threshold, before falling slightly as the day continued. Berkshire has famously never split the stock, which sells for almost 70% more than the median price of a home in the U.S., according to data from the St. Louis Fed.\nThat\u2019s because Buffett wants to attract investors with investment horizons in line with his buy-and-hold philosophy. The shares have gained 29% year to date, compared to just 18% for the S&P 500. Investors can gain cheaper exposure to Buffett\u2019s portfolio, however, with the company\u2019s Class B shares, which also hit an all-time high Wednesday and are trading above the $462 mark.\nBefore he was known as the Oracle of Omaha, Buffett bought a struggling New England textile manufacturer in 1965, believing it was available for a bargain. It proved to be a bad bet, but Buffett transformed the company into one of the largest conglomerates in history, making Berkshire a vehicle for his investment philosophy that centers on value-oriented stock picking and diverse acquisitions.\nRead more: My run-in with Warren Buffett involved a bankrupt textile mill\u2014I outbid him, but he held no grudge: Wilbur Ross\nHis approach proved successful. From 1965 to the end of 2022, Berkshire\u2019s stock rose 3,787,464%, far outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 24,708% gain. If you invested $10,000 in Berkshire 59 years ago, Fortune\u2019s Will Daniel noted, you would have made $378 million by the end of that span.\nAs a result, Berkshire is flirting with a club previously only occupied by the U.S. tech giants and Saudi Aramco, officially the Saudi Arabian Oil Group, the kingdom\u2019s state-owned oil company. Buffett's conglomerate boasts the seventh-biggest market cap in the U.S., exceeding those of Eli Lily, Broadcom, and Tesla.\nThe tech members of what Fortune\u2019s Shawn Tully dubbed the Trillion-Dollar Club enjoy incredible dominance in their respective markets. Their long-term fates, meanwhile, appear tied to the hundreds of billions of dollars they\u2019re spending to ensure they remain leaders in the age of AI.\nBuffett\u2019s company, therefore, is distinct for its old-school holdings. Berkshire\u2019s signature property is Geico Insurance, and it also owns household names like Duracell, Fruit of the Loom, Dairy Queen, and BNSF Railway. Buffett is revered for his value-based approach, which has typically favored the likes of Coca-Cola and American Express rather than Big Tech, and his company owns more short-term treasuries than the Federal Reserve.\nNonetheless, it\u2019s worth noting that Apple makes up roughly 40% of Berkshire\u2019s portfolio, remaining the company\u2019s biggest holding, even after Buffett created headlines by recently offloading almost half of his position in the iPhone maker. The selloff, which generated the bulk of Berkshire\u2019s $90 billion in proceeds from sales in the first half of 2024, Tully wrote, might go down \u201cas of one of the best bets of his career.\u201d\nBuffett has previous warned Berkshire\u2019s size could become an obstacle to future returns, saying the conglomerate is generating more cash ($277 billion, including short-term equivalents, as of last quarter) than it can adequately deploy.\nThus far, however, he and his investors have had plenty to celebrate.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Jamie Chisholm ",
        "Text": "The August jobs number has hit a market that was again looking nervous. The S&P 500 SPX is down 2.6% over the three trading days this week as many of the big tech names that led the rally to a record in the summer falter amid overvaluation fears. Nvidia NVDA is down 24% from its intraday peak.\nBut there was one well known stock that hit a fresh record high this week: Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A BRK.B.\nThe stock market is stumbling because investors suspect a Fed mistake\n\u2018My husband blew a gasket\u2019: I bought a $20,000 Toyota SUV using financing. My spouse said, \u2018Pay it off immediately.\u2019 Did I get a bad deal?\n\u2018At times, the pain is unbearable\u2019: My daughter cut me out of her life.

Does he have the right?\nNvidia investors don\u2019t need to worry \u2014 unless the stock falls below these prices\nWarren Buffett\u2019s insurance, utility, freight and investment conglomerate joined the $1 trillion market cap club recently. And such was its recent spurt to a new high that its 14-day relative strength index, a momentum gauge, rose at one point above 85 on Wednesday, according to MarketWatch data.\nThat overbought RSI has encouraged some profit taking, but Berkshire is still up 28.3% for the year to date.\nSuch a performance is ammunition for Christopher Bloomstran, the long-time Berkshire investor and co-owner of investment firm Semper Augustus Investments, who this week in an X missive took to task The Economist, whose Schumpeter column had a look at Berkshire\u2019s recent stock market returns and asked \u201cHas Warren Buffett lost his touch\u201d.\nThem\u2019s fightin\u2019 words to Bloomstran! And some all-cap emphasis duly followed.\nHe notes that Schumpeter says that Berkshire \u201croughly\u201d earned what the S&P 500 did over the last ten years. \u201cNo,\u201d says Bloomstran. \u201cBerkshire outperformed. And that\u2019s with Berkshire ALREADY paying taxes on the dividends it receives where taxable investors must pay tax on their fund/ETF dividend distributions, lowering after-tax returns.\u201d\nBloomstran says that the Economist cherry-picked their data and in fact \u201cBerkshire took the S&P behind the woodshed of late and pummeled it.\u201d\nHe notes that over the last decade Berkshire returned 246.4% against 230.9% for the S&P 500, but the Economist decided to examine a 14-year comparison during which the latter did manage to outperform. \u201cSeriously? Fourteen? That\u2019s from just after the financial crisis. In FACT, in all but TWO of the annual intervals from recent to 59 years, BRK wins, and generally by A LOT,\u201d Bloomstran writes.\nAnother area of contention is the Economist\u2019s comparison between Berkshire and Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT. The magazine says the two tech giants have more than three times the annual profit of Berkshire, Bloomstran notes.\n\u201cReally? BRK\u2019s annual economic earnings are roughly $60 billion (earning more at the moment since they are earning nearly $15 billion alone on just their T-bills).\u201d\nApple, he says, currently earns about $100 billion, (which is not three times Berkshires $60 he notes acidly), while the iPhone maker is capitalized at more than $3 trillion, or roughly 34 times earnings. Microsoft earns $88 billion and also sports a market cap of about $3 trillion, equating to roughly 35 times earnings.\n\u201cBerkshire, meanwhile sports a 16.7 times multiple, higher than in recent years but still a discount to my appraisal of intrinsic value,\u201d says Bloomstran.\nAn unsuspecting reader of the Economist \u201cmight conclude that the index is a better investment than BRK,\u201d says Bloomstran. \u201cAt what is likely a secular peak in the index, that\u2019s a very dangerous suggestion.\u201d\nU.S. stock-index futures ES00 YM00 NQ00 have recovered losses after the jobs data as benchmark Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y slip.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is planning its second yen bond sale this year, fueling gains in trading houses on speculation it\u2019s looking to boost investments in Japan.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai\u2019s Sky-High Rents\nGang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon\u2019s Fast-Growing Cities\nA Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda\u2019s Capital City\nNew Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century\nClimate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World\u2019s Megacities\nBerkshire hired BofA Securities Inc. and Mizuho Securities Co. for a potential benchmark yen-denominated senior unsecured bond offering in the global market. The company is a regular issuer of yen bonds and last sold such debt in April, in the firm\u2019s largest such deal since it first tapped the market in 2019.\nThe company\u2019s fund-raising plans are closely watched by equity-market investors as Buffett has purchased stakes in trading firms, which helped propel the Nikkei 225 stock gauge to a record high earlier this year. Veteran investor Buffett said in his annual letter in February that Berkshire has financed most of its investment in Japanese companies through yen bond offerings.\nBerkshire had about \u00a51.41 trillion ($9.8 billion) of yen bonds outstanding as of Oct. 1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\u201cThere\u2019s still more room for Berkshire to increase its stake in trading houses,\u201d said Takehiko Masuzawa, head of equity trading at Phillip Securities Japan.

        "Title": "Warren Buffett Has Nearly 50% of Berkshire Hathaway's Investable Portfolio in 1 Incredibly Safe Bet",
        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett is regarded as one of the greatest investors of all time, and he has the track record to justify that view.\nBetween when he took control of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965 and the end of last year, it produced compound annualized returns of 19.8% for shareholders. That's nearly twice the 10.2% average total return of the S&P 500 in that time. But it's when that growth rate gets compounded over time -- 58 years in this case -- that the performance gap becomes truly remarkable. Over that span, Berkshire's total return has been 140 times that of the index.\nSo, when Buffett makes changes in Berkshire's investment portfolio, the whole investing world pays attention. And he has been rapidly amassing a position in one super-safe investment -- a position that is approaching 50% of the company's entire investment portfolio.\nBuffett has never been one to shy away from investing a lot of money into a single idea.\nFor example, he put a lot of money into Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) between 2016 and 2018, spending around $36 billion on that stock over the period. At one point, Berkshire Hathaway's Apple stake grew to become about 50% of its equity portfolio, but Buffett has been selling the stock lately. His $75 billion sale of Apple stock during the second quarter cut Berkshire's remaining position nearly in half.\nBuffett's stated reasoning for that move was that he wanted to take advantage of the current corporate tax rate. Under the 2017 tax law that cut corporate tax rates to their current level, the cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025, so he naturally expects them to increase in 2026 and beyond. But Buffett's decision to trim his Apple stake also suggests he views the shares as fairly valued or at best, only slightly undervalued relative to their intrinsic value. It wouldn't make sense to sell an asset well below its value to save on taxes.\nAnother big Berkshire stock holding is Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). Buffett acquired the stake in Bank of America through warrants he acquired by investing in preferred shares of the stock in 2011. That allowed him to buy a lot of common stock in 2017 at the bargain price of $7.14 per share. He then proceeded to add onto that holding.\nAlthough Bank of America was once Buffett's second-largest holding, he's started selling shares of it too. Since the start of the third quarter, he's sold $7.2 billion worth of the bank stock. His reasoning appears to be the same as his reasoning behind Apple: Better to pay the taxes on Berkshire's profits now before the current low corporate tax rate expires. For reference, Buffett's average selling price for Bank of America stock recently has been more than $40 per share, nearly six times what he paid for it.\nApple and Bank of America aren't the only stocks Buffett's been selling recently. In fact, he's sold more stock than he bought in each of the past seven quarters, and based on his Bank of America sales in Q3, it looks like it will soon officially be two full years of consistent net selling for Buffett.\nBut he has to do something with the proceeds of all those stock sales. And Buffett has been piling the money into a super safe investment that's approaching 50% of his total investment portfolio.\nAs Buffett sells stocks, he's been putting the funds into a very specific investment: short-term Treasury bills. These are Treasury bonds that mature within one year. Buffett prefers those maturing within six months or less. Through the first six months of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway padded its Treasury holdings by $94 billion.\nThe company held a total of $277 billion in Treasury bills and cash as of the end of the second quarter. Even as Buffett has sold shares, Berkshire's core operations continue to produce operating cash flow of roughly $12 billion to $13 billion each quarter. On top of that, Berkshire will collect roughly $3.5 billion in interest from the Treasuries it already holds. Add it all up, and Berkshire's position in short-term Treasury bills is rapidly approaching $300 billion (assuming Buffett hasn't found a great company to buy in the last 2 1/2 months).\nFor reference, based on publicly available reports, Berkshire's equity portfolio is worth just over $300 billion as of this writing. That means Buffett's Treasury position could be almost half of Berkshire's investment portfolio.\nIt's important to note Buffett prefers short-term Treasury bills; he won't invest in longer-dated government bonds. \"We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments,\" Buffett wrote in Berkshire's latest quarterly report. Bonds with longer maturities usually provide higher yields, but come with more interest-rate risk. If market rates increase, the values of those bonds will decrease more than shorter maturity securities.\nBuffett has been getting the best of both worlds recently. The inverted yield curve led to higher yields for short-term bonds compared to long-term bonds. But with the Federal Reserve set to start lowering interest rates shortly, short-term yields should fall faster than long-term yields, ultimately resulting in much less interest income for Berkshire Hathaway.\nWhile Buffett suggested he's fine with holding hundreds of billions in Treasuries right now regardless of yield during Berkshire's shareholder meeting earlier this year, he may find alternatives more attractive as rates come down.\nBuffett is in charge of a $1 trillion conglomerate with investable assets that exceed $600 billion -- even more if you include the insurance float available to him for investment. The number of investments that could meaningfully move the needle for Berkshire Hathaway is relatively small.\nOn that score, the average retail investor is in a much more advantageous position. The entire investment universe is at their disposal. Buffett's actions and asset allocation suggest there aren't as many bargains in the stock market as there once were, but there are still plenty of great stocks to buy in the current environment.\nAlthough the yield on cash savings right now may be more attractive than it has been in a long time, long-term investments in stocks have consistently produced the highest returns. Trying to time the market and pick just the right time to deploy a lot of cash is not a feat most individual investors should attempt. Even Buffett suggests that people should add to their investments during every market environment (bullish or bearish), spreading out their stock buys over time, and remaining consistent with their purchases.\nIt can sometimes be hard to resist the temptation to follow Buffett's lead, but it's important to remember that he's playing a slightly different game than the average investor.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jonathan Stempel ",
        "Text": "By Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) -Ajit Jain, the longtime top insurance executive at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, sold more than half of his Class A shares in the conglomerate this week.\nAccording to a Wednesday night regulatory filing, the 73-year-old Jain sold 200 Berkshire Class A shares on Sept. 9 for about $139.1 million, at an average price of $695,418 per share.\nThe sale included 104 shares Jain held directly and 96 held by family trusts. No reason was provided.\nBerkshire did not immediately respond on Thursday to a request for comment.\nJain's selling occurred five days after Berkshire's share price peaked above $727,000, and less than two weeks after its market valuation first topped $1 trillion.\nBerkshire has slowed its own stock repurchases and let cash grow to $277 billion, perhaps in part reflecting stock valuations.\nCathy Seifert, a CFRA Research analyst who rates Berkshire a \"buy,\" said Jain's selling may reflect personal circumstances rather than his view of Berkshire's prospects.\n\"Those of us who have watched Berkshire Hathaway for a long time have suspected there may be a changing of the guard in insurance operations,\" she said. \"My sense is that he may be moving on, and I suspect that is behind his stock sales.\"\nJain still oversees 166 Class A shares, including 61 held directly, 55 held by the trusts, and 50 held by his nonprofit Jain Foundation.\nHe also oversees 124,308 Berkshire Class B shares, equal to about 83 Class A shares, held by the foundation.\nBorn in India, Jain joined Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire in 1986 and led its expansion in reinsurance, with a specialty in pricing for large risks such as natural catastrophes.\nBuffett has credited Jain with adding tens of billions of dollars of shareholder value, and once said that if he, Jain, and late vice chairman Charlie Munger were in a sinking boat and only one could be saved, \"Swim to Ajit.\"\nGreg Abel, 62, Berkshire's other vice chairman, is expected to eventually succeed Buffett, 94, as chief executive.\nHe owns about $150 million Berkshire Class A shares, compared with $78 million owned by Jain directly or in the trusts. The shares closed down 0.7% at $675,380 on Thursday.\n\"We continue to be comfortable that the interests of Mr. Jain and Mr. Abel are aligned with shareholders,\" Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said in an email.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler and Marguerita Choy)\n"

        "Title": "Is Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) The Best Geothermal Stock To Invest In?",
        "Author": "  Mashaid Ahmed ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 6 Best Geothermal Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we will have a look at where Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) ranks on our list of the best geothermal stocks to invest in.\nGeothermal energy is a type of renewable energy source derived from the continuous heat generated within the Earth. This heat is produced by the slow decay of radioactive particles in the Earth\u2019s core and can be used for various applications such as generating electricity and heating.\u00a0Unlike other renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, geothermal energy is stable and offers a constant and reliable supply of power, regardless of weather conditions or time of day.\u00a0Additionally, geothermal plants have a smaller land footprint compared to wind farms and solar panels, making them a more efficient choice for regions with high geothermal activity.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global geothermal energy market was valued at $70.14 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow from to $117.02 billion by 2032, with a CAGR of 6.61%. The Asia-Pacific region leads the geothermal industry and holds a market share of 37.14%. In the U.S., the focus is on maximizing renewable electricity output, particularly through Geothermal District Heating (GDH) systems. According to the GeoVision report, the U.S. has the potential to establish 17,500 GDH systems by 2050. Currently, only 23 systems are operational nationwide.\nOne of the key hurdles for geothermal development has been the high cost and risk of drilling and finding viable resources, companies are overcoming these challenges with innovative drilling techniques. These advancements enable the creation of geothermal wells without depending on a site\u2019s natural permeability. Companies are also making drilling wells more cost-effective and sustainable by using a proprietary thermally conductive material and recycling water through a closed-loop system, which can extend the lifespan of its wells to over 30 years, making the technology attractive for long-term energy production.\nAfter years of slow development, geothermal energy is gaining serious momentum and investors are increasingly bullish on geothermal due to technological breakthroughs. Andrew Beebe, Managing Director at Obvious Ventures, believes the innovations now being developed will make geothermal energy more predictable, cost-effective, and scalable. As new technologies make geothermal wells more efficient, scalable, and cost-effective, the sector is poised for rapid growth, offering a unique opportunity for forward-thinking investors. Geothermal startups are proving that, with the right innovations, the industry can evolve and meet the world\u2019s growing energy needs. The recent influx of capital is just the beginning, as investors see significant potential in a sector that has long been underutilized.\nIn the last six months alone, at least six geothermal startups have successfully closed funding rounds, one of the latest companies to benefit from this investment wave is XGS Energy, which announced an additional $20 million in Series A financing. The company\u2019s closed-loop system for reusing water in injection wells is a key innovation, designed to make geothermal energy more efficient and scalable. This is part of a broader trend, with companies like Zanskar Geothermal & Minerals raising $30 million in Series B funding for AI-powered geothermal exploration, and Fervo Energy securing $244 million in Series D financing. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that geothermal could provide 8.5% of the country\u2019s electricity by 2050.\nGeothermal\u2019s ability to provide consistent power, combined with a smaller environmental footprint, makes it an attractive alternative to other renewable options. The U.S. has vast untapped potential in areas like Geothermal District Heating, with increased investment and innovation, the geothermal industry is well-positioned to contribute to the world\u2019s renewable energy goals. With that in context let\u2019s take a look at the 6 best geothermal stocks to invest in.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used green energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 15 geothermal stocks. From that list, we shortlisted companies according to their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from our database of 912 elite hedge funds as of Q2 of 2024. Here is the list of 6 best geothermal stocks to invest in sorted in ascending order of their number of hedge funds as of Q2.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of insurance professionals in a boardroom overlooking a city skyline.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors in Q2 2024: 120\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is a multinational conglomerate holding company led by Warren Buffett. The company owns and invests in a wide array of industries, including insurance, utilities, railroads, and manufacturing. BHE Renewables, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy owns solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric projects that produce electricity for the wholesale market and customers under long-term agreements.\nBHE Renewables produces geothermal energy and operates 10 facilities in California\u2019s Imperial Valley which produces 345 megawatts of electricity. The company\u2019s geothermal brines contain relatively high concentrations of lithium which presents a lucrative opportunity for revenue generation. By extracting lithium from these brines, the company can tap into the growing demand for battery-grade lithium, providing a significant additional revenue stream alongside its core operations.\nOn June 4, BHE Renewable announced a joint venture with\u00a0 Occidental (NYSE:OXY) to deploy its TerraLithium\u2019s Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technology to extract and commercially produce high-purity lithium compounds from geothermal brines in California\u2019s Imperial Valley. The successful extraction of lithium from these geothermal plants is projected to yield around 90,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate equivalents annually, enough to power approximately 11 million electric vehicle batteries each year. This production capability will provide a significant revenue opportunity and position the company as a key player in the growing lithium supply chain.\nAnalysts expect Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) to increase its earnings by almost 15% this year and have a consensus Buy rating on the stock, with an average price target of $715,333 which indicates a potential 6.28% upside from current levels. As of the second quarter, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) stock is held by 120 hedge funds, with a total stake valued at $18.21 billion.\u00a0Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust\u00a0is the largest shareholder in the company and owns shares worth $10.01 billion as of June 30.\nOverall BRK-B ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of the best geothermal stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of BRK-B as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BRK-B but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure.

After a 5-year multimillion-dollar meticulous renovation, the essential cornerstone of Long Island\u2019s historic North Shore is ready to transfer to its next lucky proprietor.\nMusical legend Billy Joel originally purchased the estate in 2002, nicknaming it \"MiddleSea\" for the first note most pianists learn and for its location on a sprawling and picturesque peninsula, where views from the main house lend the feeling that you are indeed in the middle of the sea. The Rock & Roll Hall of Famer renowned for his classic hits, including \"Piano Man,\" \"New York State of Mind,\" and many others that have made a significant impact on American music, added several acres and a fresh style to the original 14-acre estate, bringing the current property to 26 acres with three distinct buildable waterfront lots.\nLocated at 500 Centre Island Road, Centre Island, New York, MiddleSea is listed at $49.9 million. As the renovation project recently wrapped, this artistic legacy reached a new level of contemporary luxury. The renovation focused on preserving the architectural integrity and charm of this Gold Coast home while bringing the estate up to date on modern amenities and high-quality finishes.\n\"This estate epitomizes the ultimate in luxury living,\" says Emmett Laffey, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Laffey International Realty. \"Every detail, from the architecture to the landscaping, has been carefully curated to maintain the essence of the property while elevating it to meet today\u2019s highest standards.

The 20,000 square-foot main residence flaunts oversized living spaces, gourmet kitchens, five bedrooms, eight bathrooms, and 180-degree views of the Long Island Sound. The combination of hardwood and marble floors with the stunning 30 feet cathedral ceilings mix sweeping grandeur with a modern flair. The spa, ballroom, wine cellar, and bowling alley within the home make it easy to enjoy life\u2019s finer moments.\nA beautiful three-bedroom Guest House, a five-bedroom Gate House, and an incredible three-bedroom Malibu style Beach House offer additional lodging for family and friends with a perfect balance of privacy and closeness. Beyond the property, the rolling hills and vast expanses of lush green lawns, include two exquisite swimming pools. Meticulous landscaping makes every stroll around the property a treat. The estate overflows with grandiose, unique features such as a gazebo and a covered outdoor dining area.\nWith Oyster Bay and Cold Spring Harbor waters encompassing three sides of the property, beach spaces and sea views abound. The estate boasts over 2,000 feet of private beach, practically unheard of on the Gold Coast of Long Island, which Joel also called home in his early years. It\u2019s easy to enjoy seaside recreation via the boat ramp and private dock, and air travel is a breeze with a private helipad.\nFrom the musical roots to the carefully-curated entertainment opportunities, this luxury estate is at once an icon and a classic.

        "Author": "  Research and Markets ",
        "Text": "Global Freight Marine Liability Insurance Market\nDublin, Sept. 18, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Freight Marine Liability Insurance Global Market Report 2024\" has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\nThe freight marine liability insurance market size has grown strongly in recent years. It will grow from $31.51 billion in 2023 to $33.36 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9%. The growth observed in the historic period can be credited to factors such as performance optimization, player analytics, enhanced fan engagement, injury prevention initiatives, and the widespread adoption of data-driven decision-making in the relevant sectors.\nThe freight marine liability insurance market size is expected to see steady growth in the next few years. It will grow to $40.01 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.6%. The anticipated growth in the forecast period can be linked to advancements in computer vision, the implementation of customized training programs, real-time decision support systems, the expansion of fan experiences, and the occurrence of major global sporting events. Key trends expected in the forecast period involve the integration of sports technologies with emerging technologies, advancements in wearable technology, exploration of sponsorship and revenue opportunities, emphasis on injury prevention and rehabilitation, and the continued integration of wearable technology in sports.\nThe escalating occurrence of natural disasters is anticipated to drive the growth of the freight marine liability insurance market. Natural disasters, stemming from Earth's biological processes, encompass events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, causing extensive damage to life, property, and the environment. In response, freight marine liability insurance serves as a financial safeguard for shipping companies, offering protection against potential losses and liabilities incurred during sea transportation. This coverage compensates for damages to cargo, vessels, and third parties, mitigating the adverse effects of natural disasters on the maritime industry. For example, the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) reported in January 2024 that in 2023, there were 28 weather and climate disasters, surpassing the previous record of 22 in 2020, incurring a minimum cost of $92.9 billion. Consequently, the upsurge in natural disasters is a driving force behind the growth of the freight marine liability insurance market.\nProminent players in the freight marine liability insurance market are strategically offering innovative insurance services, including specialized marine general liability insurance coverage. This comprehensive coverage caters to businesses engaged in maritime trade. A case in point is Axa XL, a US-based insurance company, which in December 2023 introduced specialized marine general liability insurance coverage tailored for marine artisans in the US. This product is designed to safeguard maritime artisans working as contractors in boat construction, maintenance, and repair, encompassing inland marine, ocean cargo, blue and brown water hulls, protection and indemnity, and excess and primary marine liabilities.In April 2023, Pen Underwriting Limited, an Australia-based specialist insurance company, successfully acquired Tay River Holdings Ltd. for an undisclosed amount. This strategic move positions Pen Underwriting Limited to enter the specialist marine liability insurance market and enhance its capabilities in niche areas such as marine trades' liability, ports and terminals liability, and marine war risks through independent broker clients. Tay River Holdings Ltd., a UK-based insurance company, specializes in marine liability, ports and terminals liability, marine war risks, and related areas, aligning with Pen Underwriting Limited's expansion objectives.The report covers market characteristics, size and growth, segmentation, regional and country breakdowns, competitive landscape, market shares, trends and strategies for this market.

        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett might be the greatest investor the world has ever seen. If anything, he probably has the most public resume to make his argument. Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), offers decades of evidence of his Wall Street magic.\nHad you invested just $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway when it went public in 1980, you'd have over $2.3 million today. That's genuinely life-changing returns on a modest investment.\nHowever, Berkshire Hathaway is worth nearly $1 trillion today, and Buffett recently turned 94. Can the stock still turn long-term investors into millionaires?\nBuffett doesn't have an easy job. Berkshire Hathaway is a holding company, which is a business entity that owns various other businesses and assets. Berkshire Hathaway owns dozens of private companies, including GEICO Insurance, railroads, energy pipelines, manufacturers, and consumer-facing brands like Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom. The company also operates an enormous stock portfolio with nearly four dozen positions worth approximately $316 billion. Buffett and his management team must act as conductors, pulling and pushing the right buttons and levers so that all these moving parts create value for Berkshire and its shareholders.\nBerkshire has been consistently successful at this, boosting its book value for decades through the economic ups and downs.\nThis steady value creation is driving the company's remarkable stock performance. Sure, Berkshire is a behemoth today, but the stock can create wealth for you if management wisely allocates Berkshire's vast financial resources to increase its book value.\nBuffett seemingly hasn't lost his touch or instincts in his old age.\nYou could credit Berkshire's soaring book value over the past decade to Buffett's investment in Apple, arguably his most extraordinary feat to date. Berkshire bought Apple in early 2016, when it traded at roughly 12 times earnings. Since then, Apple has been a multibagger, returning over 860%. The investment grew to be worth several hundreds of billions of dollars, and Buffett began selling it off earlier this year as Apple stock approached a price-to-earnings ratio of 35. That's the definition of \"Buy low, sell high.\"\nNot only did Berkshire capture much of its Apple returns by selling off a chunk of the stock, but Berkshire has financially equipped itself to be opportunistic again. The company now has an estimated $277 billion in cash, approximately 28% of its market cap today!\nKnowing Berkshire's track record, there's a good chance that Buffett or Berkshire's management team will eventually use that money well, and shareholders will benefit.\nApproaching Buffett's age as respectfully as possible, it's fair to wonder about Berkshire's long-term leadership. After all, Buffett is 94, and while he seems in good health and as sharp as ever, time eventually defeats us all. That said, investors shouldn't avoid Berkshire simply because Buffett won't be around forever to lead the ship.\nIt would be insulting to pretend that Berkshire isn't aware of this -- the company has a succession plan. Buffett has already tapped Greg Abel to lead Berkshire after he's gone. Abel has been with Berkshire for over 25 years and has undoubtedly played the student role under Buffett's mentorship.\nWill Abel allocate Berkshire's capital as well as Buffett has? There is only one Buffett, so that's a valid concern. However, Berkshire is one of the world's most financially and fundamentally robust companies. It could create value for its shareholders for decades to come. Consider having some faith until there's a reason not to.\nBerkshire can continue growing -- there are always additional investments or businesses to buy that can increase its book value. Don't forget that the companies within Berkshire also grow over time.\nIt's also fair to acknowledge that at a worth of nearly a trillion dollars, Berkshire is likely too big to generate the same returns it once did. The days of Berkshire turning $1,000 into a million dollars are probably over. However, Berkshire can still build wealth over time as part of a diversified portfolio.\nAnyone with a long-term time horizon should consider buying and holding this unique company.\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

Nvidia NVDA is down 24% from its intraday peak.\nBut there was one well known stock that hit a fresh record high this week: Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A BRK.B.\nThe stock market is stumbling because investors suspect a Fed mistake\n\u2018My husband blew a gasket\u2019: I bought a $20,000 Toyota SUV using financing.

And such was its recent spurt to a new high that its 14-day relative strength index, a momentum gauge, rose at one point above 85 on Wednesday, according to MarketWatch data.\nThat overbought RSI has encouraged some profit taking, but Berkshire is still up 28.3% for the year to date.\nSuch a performance is ammunition for Christopher Bloomstran, the long-time Berkshire investor and co-owner of investment firm Semper Augustus Investments, who this week in an X missive took to task The Economist, whose Schumpeter column had a look at Berkshire\u2019s recent stock market returns and asked \u201cHas Warren Buffett lost his touch\u201d.\nThem\u2019s fightin\u2019 words to Bloomstran! And some all-cap emphasis duly followed.\nHe notes that Schumpeter says that Berkshire \u201croughly\u201d earned what the S&P 500 did over the last ten years. \u201cNo,\u201d says Bloomstran. \u201cBerkshire outperformed. And that\u2019s with Berkshire ALREADY paying taxes on the dividends it receives where taxable investors must pay tax on their fund/ETF dividend distributions, lowering after-tax returns.\u201d\nBloomstran says that the Economist cherry-picked their data and in fact \u201cBerkshire took the S&P behind the woodshed of late and pummeled it.\u201d\nHe notes that over the last decade Berkshire returned 246.4% against 230.9% for the S&P 500, but the Economist decided to examine a 14-year comparison during which the latter did manage to outperform. \u201cSeriously? Fourteen? That\u2019s from just after the financial crisis. In FACT, in all but TWO of the annual intervals from recent to 59 years, BRK wins, and generally by A LOT,\u201d Bloomstran writes.\nAnother area of contention is the Economist\u2019s comparison between Berkshire and Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT. The magazine says the two tech giants have more than three times the annual profit of Berkshire, Bloomstran notes.\n\u201cReally? BRK\u2019s annual economic earnings are roughly $60 billion (earning more at the moment since they are earning nearly $15 billion alone on just their T-bills).\u201d\nApple, he says, currently earns about $100 billion, (which is not three times Berkshires $60 he notes acidly), while the iPhone maker is capitalized at more than $3 trillion, or roughly 34 times earnings. Microsoft earns $88 billion and also sports a market cap of about $3 trillion, equating to roughly 35 times earnings.\n\u201cBerkshire, meanwhile sports a 16.7 times multiple, higher than in recent years but still a discount to my appraisal of intrinsic value,\u201d says Bloomstran.\nAn unsuspecting reader of the Economist \u201cmight conclude that the index is a better investment than BRK,\u201d says Bloomstran. \u201cAt what is likely a secular peak in the index, that\u2019s a very dangerous suggestion.\u201d\nU.S. stock-index futures ES00 YM00 NQ00 have recovered losses after the jobs data as benchmark Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y slip.

        "Title": "Berkshire Hathaway: Buy, Sell, or Hold?",
        "Author": "  Ryan Vanzo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "There's a reason why nearly everyone who follows the stock market is familiar with Warren Buffett. Not only is he one of the greatest investors of all time, but a long-term stake in his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), has proven to be one of the best investments of all time. Over the nearly 60 years he's been at the helm, Berkshire's shares have grown at an annualized rate of roughly 20%.\nFor decades, all an investor needed to do in order to generate massive wealth was to invest with Buffett. But is that still true today?\nThe first thing for investors to understand is that Berkshire Hathaway is not immune to the law of large numbers. What does that mean? Simply put, a business with $1 million in sales has more opportunities to double its sales than a business with $1 billion in sales. Similarly, companies that are valued at $100 million will find it easier to double in size than those valued at $100 billion.\nWith a market cap that recently topped $1 trillion, Berkshire is one of the largest companies in the world. The value of the entire U.S. economy, for reference, is almost $29 trillion. Berkshire's cash stockpile alone comes to $277 billion. Berkshire made its name through decades' worth of smart acquisitions and shrewd investments, but even Buffett acknowledges that Berkshire's opportunities are dwindling as the company is growing. \"There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others,\" Buffett recently explained, adding that this size allowed for \"no possibility of eye-popping performance.\"\nSimply due to scale, Berkshire will find it more difficult to beat the market as handily as it has in the past. But that doesn't mean that Berkshire still can't beat the market by a slimmer margin.\nThis is the second thing every investor must understand: Berkshire is far from a dead investment. It has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last one-year, three-year, five-year, and 10-year time periods.\u00a0There's a good reason for this continued outperformance: Berkshire's business structure is designed for it.\nAt the core of Berkshire's empire sits a portfolio of insurance companies. These insurance businesses generate high levels of float, which is the excess cash insurers have after they collect policy premiums but before claims force them to pay that capital out. This float provides Berkshire with investable funds that it can deploy regardless of what markets are doing. It's a huge plus to have what Buffett calls \"permanent capital\" -- that is, a pool of money that is always available to put into new investments, especially when valuations crash and outside capital dries up.\nThis structural capital advantage isn't going away anytime soon, nor is the proven investing acumen of Buffett and his lieutenants -- some of whom have spent years learning from Buffett. The only challenge has been size, but recent results show that Berkshire's run is far from over.\nBRK.B Total Return Level data by YCharts\nThe simple answer is that there has never been a bad time to buy Berkshire stock in the past, and that remains true today. Of course, even the valuation of a high-quality business can get too high. But Berkshire's valuation is more than reasonable. Shares are trading at just under 1.7 times book value, which at first appears expensive compared to Berkshire's history. Never in the past decade have shares traded at such a high price-to-book basis. However, Berkshire has spent nearly $80 billion buying back its own stock since 2018, an act that has increased shareholder wealth while it artificially depressed accounting book value. A slight adjustment for this suggests Berkshire stock is simply valued on the high end of its historical range.\nIs Berkshire stock a steal at today's prices? For patient investors, yes. Paying a bit of a premium for one of the stock market's best companies will likely prove savvy for long-term shareholders.

        "Author": "  Wall Street Horizon ",
        "Text": "Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (BRK.B0 became the first non-tech-related company to join the trillion-dollar market cap club late last month, just as Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) turned 94 years old.[1] The Oracle of Omaha apparently hasn't lost his touch, despite some criticisms that Apple (AAPL) took up an outsized portion of Berkshire's portfolio in recent years.[2] The latest hot topic surrounding the largest company in the financials sector is its cash pile now almost 30% of Berkshire's market cap and about 26% of its total assets.[3]\nPropelling the stock to all-time highs has been ongoing bullish fervor in the insurance industry. Buffett made news shortly after Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in May, noting that Chubb (NYSE:CB) was the mystery stock being accumulated.[4] That turned out to be a sage move as shares of the Switzerland-based property and casualty firm are up more than 15% in the last four months, outpacing the S&P 500 over that span.[5]\nThe insurance space has been more active over the past 12 months; just take a look at the iShares U.S. Insurance ETF (IAK). Each of the fund's top 10 positions is up at least 24% since September 2023. Chubb is higher by 43% while the biggest weight, Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR), has returned 87%, dividends included.[6]\nWe noted strength among insurance equities back in the second quarter shortly after the release of the May CPI report. Unlike the Magnificent Seven names, these value-style stocks usually don't capture the spotlight. What's more, amid the tech selloff since the middle of July, IAK has kept on climbing.\nBoom times for insurance stocks probably isn't too shocking to hear if you're a homeowner and commuter (particularly if you have teenage drivers under your roof). Insurance premiums remain a notable driver of whatever inflation is left in the domestic economy, though like overall consumer prices, the rate of increase has fallen in the last handful of months.[7] It turns out that Americans are shopping around at the highest pace on record as a result, and we'll hear updates on the state of the insurance market later this week and next through two monthly interim reports.[8]\nProgressive issues its monthly sales update this Friday. Then on Monday, Sept. 13, Allstate (NYSE:ALL) posts its August Service Level report. These sorts of monthly views are particularly important between earnings seasons the next quarterly report of significance from the insurance industry will be from Progressive, to possibly occur on Thursday, Oct. 10 (unconfirmed). Travelers (NYSE:TRV), Chubb, The Hartford (NYSE:HIG), Allstate, MetLife (NYSE:MET) and Prudential (NYSE:PRU) all have third-quarter earnings reports over the second half of next month.\nMomentum can of course turn on a dime, but data from Morningstar reveal that IAK's top 10 holdings generally trade with low price-earnings ratios; just PGR has a P/E above 16.[9] Investors should not expect tech-like earnings multiples, however.[10] Insurance companies tend to see steadier sales and profit trajectories, resulting in more subdued expectations and less overall cyclicality.\nInsurance stocks chug to new highs as the S&P 500 stalls\nSource: Stockcharts.com\nAnother aspect of insurance companies is that their cost of goods sold is often not known until months or even years down the road. If premiums are on the increase, we can see that almost in real-time (or at least monthly), but if a few impactful catastrophes take place in a short period later on, then profitability can slip quickly.\nTake hurricane season as an example. This week marks the peak of tropical activity, climatologically speaking. It has been a calm year for hurricanes, sans Hurricane Beryl back in June, despite forecasts that pointed to a potentially record-breaking season.[11] All it takes is one storm to wreak havoc for insurers and hurricanes are just one type of climate-related risk to weigh.\nBigger picture, paying attention to what corporate executives and industry experts forecast regarding natural disaster trends is arguably more important than ever. Through early August, 19 weather/climate events have resulted in losses exceeding $1 billion in 2024, significantly above the inflation-adjusted average of 8.50 events, per NOAA.[12] Hurricanes are indeed a culprit, but so too are severe storms, wildfires, winter storms, flooding and even droughts and heat waves.\nWe will discuss the topic of physical climate risks in detail at our upcoming Data Minds webinar. Be sure to join us on Sept. 26 for an event on the impact of physical climate risk in business, where industry experts will discuss data-driven approaches with respect to the potential costs of asset damage, business disruption, supply chain issues and other critical impacts in enterprise and portfolio risk management.\nThe reality is that momentum has shifted in markets away from growth stocks just as we hit a notoriously volatile calendar stretch. Interim data points, such as those from Progressive and Allstate, can provide important clues on the state of the global economy. It is also a busy time for conferences, so stay tuned to what key events could bring about volatility in markets.\n1 Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway hits $1 trillion market value, first U.S. company outside of tech to do so, CNBC, Yun Li, August 28, 2024, https://www.cnbc.com2 Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway Trims Its Massive Stake in Apple, The Wall STreet Journal, Karen Langley, February 14, 2024, https://www.wsj.com3 Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway sells more Bank of America, has now cut stake by nearly 15%, CNBC, Alex Crippen, August 31, 2024, https://www.cnbc.com4 Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway reveals insurer Chubb as confidential stock it's been buying, CNBC, Yun Li, May 15, 2024, https://www.cnbc.com5 Progressive Corp, StockCharts, September 5, 2024, http://stockcharts.com6 iShares US Insurance, Morningstar, September 5, 2024, https://www.morningstar.com7 Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: Tenants' and Household Insurance in U.S. City Average, Federal Reserve Bank St. Louis, August 14, 2024, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/8 Americans Shop Around for Insurance More Than Ever as Costs Soar, Bloomberg, Alexandre Tanzi, August 28, 2024, https://www.bloomberg.com9 iShares US Insurance ETF, Morningstar, September 5, 2024, https://www.morningstar.com10 iShares US Insurance ETF, Morningstar, September 5, 2024, https://www.morningstar.com11 NOAA Predicts the Most Hurricanes That It Has Ever Forecast, The Wall Street Journal, Eric Niiler, May 23, 2024, https://www.wsj.com12 Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters, NCEI, August 8, 2024, https://www.ncei.noaa.gov?/\nCopyright 2024 Wall Street Horizon, Inc.

        "Title": "Watch These Berkshire Hathaway Price Levels As Stock Retreats From Record High",
        "Author": "  Timothy Smith ",
        "Text": "Stock is About 8% Below September Peak\n\nBerkshire Hathaway shares remain in the spotlight to start the week as the stock has retreated from its record high set earlier this month.\nDuring the stock's recent decline, trading volumes have decreased, indicating slowing selling momentum.\nInvestors should monitor important lower price levels on the Berkshire Hathaway chart at $446, $421, and $398, while watching the $480 area if the stock resumes its longer-term uptrend.\n\nShares in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) will likely remain in the spotlight to start the week as the stock continues to retreat from a record high set earlier this month that saw the conglomerate's market capitalization briefly surpass $1 trillion for the first time.\nBearish sentiment in recent days could potentially relate to a regulatory filing last Wednesday that revealed Berkshire\u2019s top insurance executive, Ajit Jain, sold more than half his Class A shares in the company. Jain\u2019s insider selling, coupled with the conglomerate slowing its stock repurchases and letting its cash pile swell to $277 billion, has possibly raised valuation concerns among investors.\nWhile the industrial conglomerate\u2019s more-affordable Class B stock was nearly 8% below its Sept. 4 high through Friday\u2019s close, it has still gained around 26% since the start of the year, handily outpacing the S&P 500\u2019s 18% return over the same period. Class B shares were up 0.2% at $448.70 in premarket trading about two hours before Monday's opening bell.\nBelow, we\u2019ll take a closer look at what the technicals on Berkshire\u2019s chart are saying and discuss important price levels to watch out for.\nSince a doji candlestick marked the stock\u2019s record high earlier this month, the price has undergone an orderly retracement.\nImportantly, during the decline, trading volumes have decreased, indicating slowing selling momentum.\nLooking ahead, investors should eye three lower price levels on Berkshire\u2019s chart likely to remain in play amid further weakness.\nThe first sits around $446, an area just below Friday\u2019s closing price where the shares could attract buying interest near the July swing high and a minor pause in the stock\u2019s impulsive move higher between early August and early September.\nA failure to hold this level could see the shares decline to the $421 area, a location on the chart where investors may look for buying opportunities near a horizontal line linking the prominent February and April peaks with several trading levels situated in close proximity to last month\u2019s low.\nOngoing selling in Berkshire shares may bring the $398 region into play. This area, which lies slightly below a multi-month uptrend line and the 200-day moving average, would likely encounter support from a trendline connecting a series of price action from early February to early May.\nIf Berkshire shares find a floor at current levels and resume their longer-term uptrend, investors should monitor the $480 level, an area where investors may look to exit the stock around its record high. Such a move which would complete a basic five phase Elliot Wave pattern.\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
