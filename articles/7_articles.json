        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Azure cloud-computing service posted a slowdown in quarterly growth, testing the patience of investors anxious to see a payoff from huge investments in artificial intelligence products.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSinger Akon\u2019s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice\nValencia Follows Barcelona in Crackdown on Short-Term Rentals\nUber and Lyft Strike NYC Deal to Scale Back Driver Lockouts\nWhat a Beautiful Bus Stop Can Do\nA Vast Wetland Park Seeks to Slake a Thirsty Megacity\nRevenue from Azure, Microsoft\u2019s main growth engine in recent years, rose 29% in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared with a 31% jump in the previous period. About 8 percentage points of the increase in the recent period was attributable to AI, up from 7 percentage points in the prior quarter.\n\u201cIt was really about the cloud services number \u2014 it needed to just be a little higher,\u201d Doug Clinton, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said on Bloomberg Television. Still, the accelerated contribution from AI confirms business momentum with that emerging technology, wrote Raimo Lenschow, an analyst at Barclays.\nChief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has been infusing Microsoft\u2019s product line with AI technology from partner OpenAI, including digital assistants called Copilots that can summarize documents and generate computer code, emails and other content. The company also is selling Azure cloud subscriptions featuring OpenAI products. Alongside rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Google, Microsoft has been spending billions to construct new data centers to meet demand for cloud computing and power-hungry AI services.\nOn a call with analysts Tuesday, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said that although Azure growth will continue to slow in the current quarter, which ends in September, investments in data centers and servers will let the company capitalize on demand and accelerate Azure growth in the second half of fiscal 2025.\nMicrosoft shares fell less than 1% on Wednesday as the markets opened in New York. As of the Tuesday close, the stock had gained about 12% in 2024.\nIn the fourth quarter, which ended June 30, capital expenditures \u2014 closely watched by investors as the company embarks on its historic AI build-out \u2014 jumped to $19 billion, including server farm leases, from $14 billion in the previous quarter. That number will increase in the new fiscal year, Hood said.\nIn an interview, investor relations chief Brett Iversen said Microsoft currently lacks sufficient capacity to fulfill customer demand for cloud and AI services. \u201cWe\u2019re building out for that as quickly as we can,\u201d he said.\nIn recent weeks, skittish investors have signaled impatience with tech companies\u2019 efforts to profit from their massive investments in AI. Last week, the shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc. sank after the company surprised Wall Street with sharply higher costs that overshadowed strong sales.\nMany of Microsoft\u2019s corporate customers are only just starting to use new AI assistants, which still struggle to understand the context of some requests and handle commands involving multiple apps. The Copilot service, which doubles the cost of a monthly subscription to about $60 per user for corporations, is expected to eventually generate a robust flow of recurring revenue.\nIversen said customers are increasingly adopting the company\u2019s higher-tier Office 365 product, which includes generative AI features. Sales from commercial cloud products including Azure and office applications rose 21% to $36.8 billion, Microsoft said, about in line with Wall Street estimates.\nTotal revenue in the fourth quarter increased 15% to $64.7 billion, while adjusted profit was $2.95 a share, the company said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts on average estimated sales of $64.5 billion and per-share earnings of $2.94.\nOn the call, Nadella said the number of people using Copilot at work doubled quarter-over-quarter. Use of Copilot within GitHub, which allows for AI assistance in software development, accounts for 40% of revenue growth within that business, he added.\nThe company\u2019s Xbox video-gaming unit posted 61% growth in content and services revenue, much of that fueled by the $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, which was completed in October.\nHours before reporting its financial results, Microsoft\u2019s Azure and Office 365 services suffered partial outages, which also took down services by customers including Starbucks Corp.\nJust a couple of weeks earlier, some 8 million computers running Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system crashed after the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. released a flawed software update. Though the outage was caused by CrowdStrike, \u201cMicrosoft may still have to deal with negative perception around perceived vulnerabilities to its operating system,\u201d Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup, wrote ahead of earnings.\nNadella touted progress in the company\u2019s cybersecurity products during the call with investors. The company says it has more than 1.2 million security customers, and Defender for Cloud, a security product, passed $1 billion in revenue over the past year. \u201cWe continue to prioritize security above all else,\u201d Nadella said.\n(Updates with share reaction in sixth paragraph.

Some analysts say, however, that Microsoft is coming up right behind the AI-chip titan.\nMicrosoft, which is slated to report fiscal-fourth-quarter results this month, earned $2.94 a share in the April quarter, up from $2.45 a share a year earlier and surpassing the FactSet analyst consensus estimate of $2.82.\nRelated: Microsoft delivers an AI blow to Nvidia\nRevenue totaled $61.86 billion, up from $52.9 billion and ahead of FactSet's call for $60.85 billion.\nNadella said the company posted a \"record third quarter\" that was \"powered by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $35 billion in revenue, up 23%.\"\n\"We are seeing AI democratize expertise across the workforce,\" Nadella said. \"What inventory turns are to efficiency of supply chains, knowledge turns, the creation and diffusion, and knowledge are to productivity of an organization, and Copilot for Microsoft 365 is helping increase knowledge turns.\"\nNow, you're probably fed up with all the predictions about AI being the virtual Godzilla of Next Big Things. But seriously, the people at McKinsey are forecasting some Very Big Things about generative artificial intelligence, which uses algorithms to derive original content \u2014 including audio, code, images, text, simulations, and videos \u2014 from existing content.\nThink of Microsoft-backed OpenAI, which unleashed ChapGPT onto the world in 2022.\nMcKinsey research indicates that generative-AI applications could add as much as $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually, and \"recent breakthroughs in the field have the potential to drastically change the way we approach content creation.\"\n\u201cThe opportunity for businesses is clear,\u201d the consulting firm said in an April report. \u201cGenerative-AI tools can produce a wide variety of credible writing in seconds, then respond to criticism to make the writing more fit for purpose.\u201d\nThis has implications for a wide variety of industries, from IT and software groups, which can benefit from the instantaneous, largely correct code generated by AI models, to organizations in need of marketing copy, the firm said.\n\u201cIn short, any organization that needs to produce clear written materials potentially stands to benefit,\u201d McKinsey said.\nMore AI Stocks:\nAnalyst adjusts Nvidia stock rating on valuation\nAnalyst revises Facebook parent stock price target in AI arms race\nGoogle falling behind climate goals thanks to AI ramp up\nWhile many have reacted to ChatGPT (and AI and machine learning more broadly) with fear, the firm said, machine learning \"clearly has the potential for good.\"\n\"In the years since its wide deployment, machine learning has demonstrated impact in a number of industries, accomplishing things like medical imaging analysis and high-resolution weather forecasts,\" McKinsey said.\nAnalysts say that Microsoft is well-positioned in the generative-AI space, a kind of GenAI Knight, if you will. (Or maybe you won't.)\nRelated: Analyst adjusts Nvidia stock rating on valuation\nLast month, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth told investors Microsoft was \"increasingly positioned to lead the AI revolution\" through the integration of generative-AI functionality throughout its software stack and products.\nAnalysts at Argus cited MSFT's GenAI strength on July 9 when they raised the investment firm's price target on Microsoft to $526 from $475 and affirmed a buy rating on the shares.\nMicrosoft put itself near the center of the generative AI platform transformation, with only hardware supplier Nvidia having a greater claim.\nArgus says in a research note that the Redmond, Wash., company will continue to pursue long-term growth through its GenAI and cloud investment.\nMicrosoft is also among the few names offering a complete integrated product set aimed at enterprise efficiency, cloud transformation, collaboration, and business intelligence while maintaining a large and loyal customer base, a large cash cushion, and a rock-solid balance sheet, the firm added.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of pain coming for stocks\n"

        "Text": "Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) and AMD (AMD) started off the trading day on Wednesday heading in opposite directions as Wall Street digested the companies\u2019 Tuesday evening earnings. Microsoft fell some 7% in after-hours trading following its shaky report and continued trading down more than 1% Wednesday afternoon. AMD shares, on the other hand, jumped more than 3%, lifting fellow chip behemoth Nvidia (NVDA) as well.\nThe companies\u2019 results and Wall Street\u2019s reaction brought the two sides of the AI trade into stark relief as traders showed their disappointment in Microsoft\u2019s AI software sales and exuberance over AMD\u2019s chip sales.\nThe opposing views show how anxious investors are to see a sizable return on companies\u2019 massive investments in the infrastructure needed to power their AI software offerings. On the flip side, chipmakers like AMD continue to reap the benefits of software makers\u2019 AI infrastructure buildout, sending revenue and shares higher.\nIn an investor note following Microsoft\u2019s announcement, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill noted that Microsoft\u2019s Azure revenue slowed in the quarter from 31% in Q3 to 30% in Q4, and is expected to continue slowing in Q1.\nAnd while Microsoft said it expects to see improvements in Azure growth in the second half of its current fiscal year, investors\u2019 reactions to the company\u2019s slight miss on Intelligent Cloud revenue, which includes its Azure platform and analysts\u2019 repeated questions about when Microsoft will start raking in cash from AI sales, shows Wall Street won\u2019t wait forever for the AI trade to pay off.\nMicrosoft\u2019s fourth quarter earnings were largely positive despite its Intelligent Cloud numbers, and even those weren\u2019t awful. The company reported Intelligent Cloud segment revenue of $28.5 billion, just shy of Wall Street\u2019s expectations of $28.7 billion, but up 19% year over year. Overall revenue came in at $64.7 billion versus an expectation of $64.5 billion.\nBut Microsoft also continues to plow cash into building out its AI data centers. According to CFO Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures, including finance leases, topped out at $19 billion, up from $14 billion in the third quarter.\n\u201cThis new figure requires faith that Microsoft is picking up sufficient demand signals, and in our view the \u2018return on capex\u2019 concerns are likely to persist,\u201d UBS Global Research analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following Microsoft\u2019s earnings announcement.\nStill, Microsoft pointed to a number of bright spots in its AI business, noting that AI contributed 8 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, up from 7 percentage points in Q3 and 1 percentage point in Q4 last year.\nThe Windows maker also noted that it\u2019s still dealing with supply constraints keeping more customers from gaining access to its AI products, which is one of the reasons for its massive AI spend. That bottleneck, however, should start to clear up sometime in the second half of 2025, the company said.\n\u201cWe believe the results and outlook for Azure AI are especially strong in light of the capacity constraints [Microsoft] faced in [the fiscal fourth quarter] and expects to continue to see in 1HF25 [first half of 2025]. More positively, management expects these issues to be alleviated by 2HF25, which should help drive a reacceleration in overall Azure revenue growth,\u201d Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz wrote in a note to investors Wednesday.\nWhile Microsoft shares struggled to gain traction Wednesday, AMD\u2019s stock climbed more than 4% in mid-day trading Wednesday, driven by better-than-expected results from the company\u2019s Data Center segment. AMD reported Data Center revenue of $2.8 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $2.75 billion, and climbing 115% year over year from $1.3 billion in Q2 last year.\nMicrosoft\u2019s capital expenditure expansion also plays into AMD\u2019s growth, since the cloud provider, and hyper scalers like it, will inevitably need to purchase graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) from the chip giant and its rivals, including Nvidia.\nTo that point, AMD raised its sales forecast for its AI chips for 2024 from $4 billion to more than $4.5 billion. We\u2019re still a few weeks away from Nvidia\u2019s earnings report on Aug. 28, but shares of the AI darling rocketed more than 10% on Wednesday on the strength of AMD\u2019s results.\nOf course, the AI trade is by no means settled, and we\u2019re still in the early days of not only the infrastructure build-out, but also in understanding how the software will impact businesses big and small, as well.\nAnd until AI hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon begin to see massive profits from their huge investments, you can expect investors to continue asking one question over and over again: \u201cWhen\u2019s the money coming in?\u201d\nGot a tip?

A big step up from the $10.95 billion in expenditure it recorded in the previous quarter.\nFears that runaway spending by tech giants on data centers would yield little payoff in the short term have dogged the US stock market this month amid signs that Wall Street may have become too optimistic about earnings growth.\nShares of Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG) fell more than 5% last week after the company reported a quarterly capital spending that exceeded estimates by nearly $1 billion, while the revenue boost from AI integrations remained modest, sparking a selloff in major tech companies.\nAlphabet said its quarterly capital expenditure would stay high for the rest of 2024 at or above $12 billion.\n\"Investors will be very focused on Microsoft's ability to continue to accelerate revenue growth, especially the portion related to AI. If revenue acceleration doesn't materialize and increases in capex continue, investors may be disappointed,\" said Gil Luria, senior software analyst at D.A. Davidson.\nMicrosoft has said it needs to spend on data centers now to overcome the capacity constraints that are hampering its ability to capitalize on AI demand.\nIts view echoes that of other tech companies, including Alphabet. The Google parent's CEO, Sundar Pichai, said last week that \"risk of under-investing (in AI infrastructure) is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing.\"\n 'Well positioned'\nThe spending surge has allowed Microsoft to court more business from its large enterprise client base by offering expanded access to its AI cloud service and rolling out features such as its 365 Copilot assistant for Word and Excel.\nMicrosoft has said the $30-per-month Copilot service, which can summarize heaps of emails into a few bullet points or speedily complete lines of computer code, is used by half of the Fortune 500 companies.\nThe Redmond, Washington-based tech giant is, however, yet to disclose the revenue contribution from the service, and analysts believe Copilot's impact will be more apparent in the back half of calendar year 2024.\n\"While a lot of focus has been on consumer-facing applications like ChatGPT, (generative AI) is potentially a larger opportunity for enterprise and Microsoft is just incredibly well positioned to capitalize on their install base,\" said Igor Tishin, analyst at Harding Loevner, a $55 billion asset manager that counts Microsoft and Alphabet among its largest holdings.\nMicrosoft shares have risen about 13% this year, adding more than $350 billion to the company's market value. The stock hit a record high on July 5, but has dipped nearly 9% in the recent tech selloff. It has underperformed a 14.5% rise in the S&P 500 this year.\nThe company is expected to post a 14.6% increase in overall revenue for the April-June period, compared with 17% growth in the previous quarter.\nThat is mostly down to slower growth in its personal computing business that includes Windows and the Xbox gaming division.

Google-parent Alphabet warned last week that its capital spending would stay elevated for the rest of the year.\nMicrosoft said its capital spending rose 77.6% to $19 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter that ends June 30, with cloud and AI-related spending accounting for nearly all of the expenditures. For all of fiscal 2024, capital spending totaled $55.7 billion.\nGroup CFO Amy Hood said the spending was necessary to support demand for AI services and the company was investing in assets that \"will be monetized over 15 years and beyond.\"\nStill, investors who have run up Microsoft stock by nearly a quarter in the past 12 months on AI optimism were disappointed with the Azure growth.\nMicrosoft predicted that the business would grow 28% to 29% on a constant currency basis in the July-September quarter, compared with estimates of 29.7%, according to Visible Alpha.\nThat followed a 29% rise in the quarter ended June 30, which was below estimates of 30.6% and marked a slowdown from the previous three months.\n\"The street doesn't have a lot of patience. They see you spending billions of dollars and they want to see a pickup in revenue of that amount,\" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which holds shares in Microsoft.\n\"If these companies do not hit it out of the ballpark and are far better than the estimates then they are going to be knocked back,\" he added.\nWhile overall Azure growth slowed, AI services accounted for a larger portion of the increase in revenue in the June quarter at 8 percentage points, compared with 7 percentage points in the previous quarter.\nThe company does not break out the absolute revenue figure for Azure, the part of its business best situated to capitalize on booming interest in AI.\nCEO Satya Nadella said that Azure AI was now used by more than 60,000 customers, up nearly 60% year-on-year and that the average spend per customer continues to grow.\nNadella has pushed the company to go all-in on the technology, weaving AI into almost every product from search engine Bing to productivity software such as Word.\nLarge parts of those efforts have been fueled by technology from OpenAI, in which Microsoft has invested about $13 billion, including the 365 Copilot assistant for enterprises.\nThe productivity business - home to the Office suite of apps, LinkedIn and 365 Copilot - posted growth of 11%, compared with expectations of 10%.\nRevenue from its Intelligent Cloud unit - home to the Azure cloud-computing platform - rose 19% to $28.5 billion in the fourth quarter, missing analysts' estimates of $28.68 billion, LSEG data showed.\nMicrosoft - seen as a bellwether for the tech industry thanks to its wide-spanning business - said total revenue rose 15% to $64.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had expected $64.39 billion, according to LSEG data.\nRevenue from its personal computing business, which includes Windows and devices such as the Xbox and Surface computers, grew 14% as Microsoft benefited from stabilizing personal computer sales. The PC market grew for the second straight quarter in the April-June period, according to research firm IDC.\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni and Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and Anna Tong in San FranciscoEditing by Sriraj Kalluvila, Sayantani Ghosh, Matthew Lewis and Sam Holmes)\n"

Stronger-than-expected performance in first-party content was partially offset by third-party content performance. Xbox hardware revenues declined 42% (down 41% at cc).At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 3 points to revenue growth, which was a 2-point drag on operating income growth and had a negative 6 cents impact on earnings per share. A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from the company\u2019s prior relationship as a third-party partner to first-party, and also includes $938 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs.\nMicrosoft offers the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from NVIDIA NVDA and AMD, as well as the company\u2019s own first-party silicon.

        "Text": "In 2023, Microsoft celebrated the 40th birthday of Microsoft Windows. Not long after that launch, they decided to become a publicly traded company. Even though the company has had a few ups and downs, many people have become quite wealthy because of its success.\nTrending Now: I\u2019m an Investor: I\u2019m Making These Money Moves Immediately If Trump Wins\nTry This: 6 Unusual Ways to Make Extra Money (That Actually Work)\n\u201cBack in 2015, I saw potential in Microsoft\u2019s cloud strategy and invested when their stock was around $40,\u201d says John Pennypacke, VP, Sales & Marketing at Deep Cognition. \u201cYes, that decision has paid off handsomely, with my investment growing over 600% since then. Microsoft\u2019s pivot to cloud computing and its grip on the enterprise software market really drove this success.\u201d\nIt\u2019s no secret that Microsoft has been extremely profitable for investors recently. A significant part of that success has been due to its AI and cloud products. Its most recent quarterly earnings reported a profit of $12.51 billion, a 32% year-over-year (YoY) growth for the intelligent cloud unit.\nBased on Microsoft\u2019s success for investors, we wanted to find out what other companies people should be optimistic about.\nAlso here\u2019s ten other companies best to invest in right now.\nLike Microsoft, Nvidia has been on a tear over the past year. Year to date (YTD), the stock is up 144%, and its one-year return is at 164%. Much of the recent success has been powered by its push into generative AI.\nBe Aware: In 5 Years, These 2 Stocks Will Be More Valuable Than Apple\nLearn More: 10 Things You Should Do When Your Child\u2019s 529 Account Reaches $20,000\n\u201cAt Deep Cognition, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs power our AI development,\u201d says Pennypacke. \u201cTheir lead in AI and graphics processing sets them up to ride the wave of growing AI applications across industries. I\u2019ve seen up close how their tech keeps pushing the boundaries of what we can do in AI.\u201d\nEven though some will tell you the AI and Nvidia run is starting to lose steam, others think there is still plenty of room for it. It\u2019s also important to remember that Nvidia was an important company before AI came into the picture. It helps run laptops, video game consoles, cloud platforms, self-driving technology, and more.\nWealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.\nSketchers, a designer and developer of casual footwear for men, women, and children, is another company to watch out for. YTD, they\u2019ve had a modest gain of 2%, but their stock price is up more than 19% over the past year.\nExpert Advice: I\u2019m a Self-Made Millionaire: 5 Stocks You Shouldn\u2019t Sell\n\u201cWe like SKX\u2019s (Sketchers) attractive projected double digit growth in both revenue and earnings, which the market currently prices at a very reasonable Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E) of 13.1x (2025),\u201d says Ulrich Ebensperger, Founder and CEO of Ziggma.\nSketchers will report their latest earnings on July 25, and the consensus is that quarterly sales growth will be roughly 10% to $2.21 billion. This comes after they announced quarterly revenue of $2.25 billion in the previous quarter, up 12.5%.\nMany people think of Amazon as one of the biggest retailers of consumer products. While that\u2019s true, Amazon\u2019s revenue is much more complex.\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the world\u2019s largest cloud services business, with more than $100 billion in annual revenue. Similar to Nvidia, much of its recent growth has come from AI. They offer businesses everything from chips to customized language models.\n\u201cWhile their e-commerce platform is everywhere, it\u2019s AWS that gets me excited as a tech leader,\u201d says Pennypacke. \u201cWe lean heavily on AWS, and I\u2019ve watched it become a must-have for businesses big and small. Their moves into healthcare and advertising also look promising for future growth.\u201d\nAmazon isn\u2019t the cheapest stock, with a P/E ratio of 40.1X, but its ability to continue to generate sustainable growth from its different business units should be exciting for investors.\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, social media websites like Pinterest were on fire. With people stuck inside their homes, they turned to social media to occupy their time. Unfortunately, once restrictions ended and people started venturing outside again, social media usage declined. For companies like Pinterest, this significantly impacted the stock price.\nHowever, with significant improvements made to the platform, including better search functionality and videos, Pinterest is once again starting to soar. They recently announced that their monthly active users were up 12% YoY to 518 million people, an all-time high.\nPinterest is also benefiting from the input of activist investor Elliot Advisors, who has been very vocal about the strategic changes needed within the company.\n\u201cWe like PINS because famous activist investor Elliott Advisors has identified a number of ways to drive shareholder value through growth and profitability initiatives,\u201d says Ebensperger. \u201cElliott is hard at work pushing the Board to implement these initiatives after having obtained a Board seat.\u201d\nTaiwan Semiconductor recently reported a blowout quarter, with revenue up 33% to $20.8 billion. 52% of this revenue was due to chips being used for AI.\nOne of the biggest unknowns for a company like Taiwan Semiconductor is what the impacts of a Trump victory in November might mean. While most production is outside the United States, they are building a complex in Phoenix, Arizona. The first part should be ready in 2025, and the next two by the decade\u2019s end. Its ability to manufacture inside the United States could greatly impact its profitability. However, even with these unknowns, the projected full-year revenue growth is 21%.\n\u201cAs we cook up cutting-edge AI solutions, we know how vital advanced semiconductors are,\u201d says Pennypacke. \u201cTaiwan Semiconductor\u2019s manufacturing chops make them a key player in the tech supply chain, and they\u2019ll only become more important as demand for advanced chips in AI, 5G, and IoT keeps climbing.\u201d\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I Got Rich Off Microsoft: Here Are 5 Companies You Should Invest in Now\n"

In the fiscal third quarter, the number of 100 million dollar-plus Azure deals increased more than 80% year over year, while the number of 10 million dollar-plus deals more than doubled.Azure's increased availability in more than 60 announced regions globally is expected to have strengthened the tech giant's competitive position in the cloud computing market, dominated by Amazon\u2019s AMZN cloud division, Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud.In the last reported quarter, AWS revenues (18% of sales) rose 17% year over year to $25.04 billion.

Google Cloud reported operating income of $900 million compared with $191 million in the year-ago quarter.\nMSFT\u2019s AI innovation continues to build on its strategic partnership with OpenAI.

The company also continues to innovate and partner broadly to bring customers the best selection of frontier models and open-source models, LLMs and SLMs.The number of Azure AI customers and average spend continue to grow.

        "Text": "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the world's largest and most influential tech companies. It's also the most valuable public company in the world at the moment at $3.4 trillion. In addition to providing cloud-computing services, market-leading operating systems, and productivity software, the technology giant is also at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nStrong earnings results and emerging opportunities in AI have helped power strong performance for the company's stock lately. The software giant's share price is up 34% over the last year alone.\nEven more impressive, the stock has delivered a return of more than 1,160% since Satya Nadella became the company's CEO in February 2014. That means that if you invested $1,000 on the day Nadella took over on Feb. 4, 2014, your investment would now be worth more than $12,570.\nWith Microsoft on a winning streak, it might be easy to forget that the company was facing some major challenges at the time Nadella took over in the CEO role. Due to some failed projects and unproductive strategic directions, the company and its stock had a rocky start to the 2010s. But Microsoft managed to deliver an incredible turnaround.\nNadella spearheaded a pivot to a new strategy that focused on subscription services. The company shifted Office and other software away from being one-time licensing purchases and instead started selling them on a subscription basis. This made the company's sales more dependable and also helped boost margins.\nHe also oversaw the strategic prioritization and growth of the company's Azure cloud infrastructure services. Azure has grown at an incredible rate over the last decade, and it currently stands as the second-largest player by market share -- trailing behind only Amazon's AWS.\nMicrosoft's cloud business is generating strong sales, growing rapidly, and posting impressive profit margins. It's also helped the company tap into emerging AI-driven demand, and the best is likely still to come.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

In 2019, when Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, hardly anyone noticed. But when ChatGPT was launched and the floodgates of generative AI innovation opened, Microsoft was seen as the leader in the AI arms race.

Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is one of the world\u2019s most important and biggest semiconductor companies. Tweaktown reports that the company's long list of customers includes tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, AMD, and Broadcom, among many others. The AI revolution is expected further to bolster Taiwan Semiconductor's demand and market share. According to Tweaktown's report, the company has a whopping 70% to 80% share of the 5nm semiconductor market and a 90% share of the 3nm chips market. Data from consultancy firm TrendForce shows that Taiwan Semiconductor had a 60% share of the global foundry market as of 2021.\nTaiwan Semiconductor's chips are used in everything from smartphones to electric car sensors and PCs. However, the huge demand for high-end chips unlocked by the generative AI boom has made TSM a promising AI stock. During a first quarter earnings call, Taiwan Semiconductor's management said it expects revenue contribution from AI processors to double this year and account for low-teens percent of total revenue. Revenue from AI is expected to grow at a 50% CAGR over the next five years and account for over 20% of the company's total revenue by 2028.\nTaiwan Semiconductor's moat in the AI chips industry is strong and wide. Firstly, the high-end chip manufacturing industry isn't easy to enter, even for major companies. Blackridge Research and Consulting firm reports that establishing a single 3nm fab could cost up to $20 billion. On top of that, Taiwan Semiconductor's real strength lies in churning millions of chips with almost no defects \u2014 the company's yield is over 95%, according to the Atlantic Council. Only Samsung is expected to come close to Taiwan Semiconductor's quality and manufacturing capability in the coming years amid its huge investments and plans to foray into the fab industry. Other than Taiwan Semiconductor, it has no formidable competitors.\nDon\u2019t Miss: Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\nDespite its dominance in the AI chips industry, Taiwan Semiconductor's share price growth has been capped, and its valuation still looks attractive compared to its peers. The stock's forward P/E is 27.7 (47 for Nvidia and 46 for AMD). The biggest concern around TSM is a possible Chinese escalation against Taiwan since the company's major manufacturing operations are based in Taiwan. However, many analysts believe these concerns are overblown and the company has no short-term risks. They say China cannot afford to go into a direct conflict with the US. According to a report by the Hudson Institute, any disruption in Taiwan's semiconductor industry could result in a $1.6 trillion economic loss to the US. Taiwan Semiconductor's chip industry dominance is seen as a \u2018Silicon Shield' for Taiwan, which the country can use to deter attacks. Earlier this month, Taiwan Semiconductor's Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei said that it's \"impossible\" to move chip manufacturing outside of Taiwan and that 80% to 90% of chip manufacturing remains in the country.\nWall Street is also growing bullish on the company. Recently, Bernstein analyst Mark Li said that high-end phones and advanced nodes could result in Taiwan Semiconductor topping its 2024 guidance. The analyst thinks the company\u2019s data center revenue is growing as expected. Li increased his price target for TSM to $200 from $150. He expects Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue to increase by 25% and EPS by 28% in 2024. Earlier this month, BofA's Brad Lin also increased his price target for TSM to $180. Lin thinks new AI plans revealed by Apple and other companies at the Computex 2024 event would drive the on-device AI trend, benefiting TSMC, which the analyst called the \"key enabler\" of AI prosperity.\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks...

        "Text": "By Foo Yun Chee\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Microsoft has clinched a 20-million-euro ($21.7 million) deal to settle an antitrust complaint about its cloud computing licensing practices, averting an EU antitrust investigation and potential hefty fine.\nCloud services organisation CISPE, whose members include Amazon and a score of small EU cloud providers, complained to the European Commission in late 2022 alleging that contractual terms imposed by Microsoft on Oct. 1 were harming Europe's cloud computing ecosystem.\nMicrosoft ranks behind market leader Amazon in the multibillion-dollar cloud computing sector but ahead of Alphabet's Google. The industry has drawn antitrust scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\"After working with CISPE and its European members for more than a year, I am pleased that we've not only resolved their concerns of the past, but also worked together to define a path forward that brings even more competition to the cloud computing market in Europe and beyond,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith said.\nMicrosoft will develop a product allowing CISPE's members to run Microsoft software on their platforms on the U.S. tech giant's Azure cloud infrastructure with prices equivalent to Microsoft's prices, CISPE said. It has nine months to deliver.\nMicrosoft will also compensate CISPE members for lost revenues related to their licensing costs over the last two years, the group said. It did not disclose financial figures.\nMicrosoft has offered about 20 million euros in total, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nThe settlement does not include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform and AliCloud, prompting criticism from the first two companies.\n\"We continue to stand with the growing number of customers, providers, and regulators globally who are calling on Microsoft to end its discriminatory practices for all customers,\" an AWS spokesperson said.\nThe head of Google Cloud said he hoped regulators elsewhere would continue to look into Microsoft's licensing practices\n\"Many regulatory bodies have opened inquiries into Microsoft's licensing practices, and we are hopeful there will be remedies to protect the cloud market from Microsoft's anti-competitive behavior,\" Amit Zavery said.\n\"We are exploring our options to continue to fight against Microsoft\u2019s anti-competitive licensing in order to promote choice, innovation, and the growth of the digital economy in Europe.\"\nCISPE said it would now withdraw its EU complaint and would not start or support complaints on these issues in Europe and elsewhere.\n\"This agreement will provide a level playing field for European cloud infrastructure service providers and their customers,\" CISPE Secretary General Francisco Mingorance said.\n($1 = 0.9240 euros)\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Christina Fincher and Mark Potter)\n"

        "Text": "Microsoft has relinquished its seat on the board of OpenAI, saying its participation is no longer needed because the ChatGPT maker has improved its governance since being roiled by boardroom chaos last year.\nIn a Tuesday letter, Microsoft confirmed it was resigning, \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d from its role as an observer on the artificial intelligence company's board.\n\u201cWe appreciate the support shown by OpenAI leadership and the OpenAI board as we made this decision,\" the letter said.\nThe surprise departure comes amid intensifying scrutiny from antitrust regulators of the powerful AI partnership. Microsoft has reportedly invested $13 billion in OpenAI.\nEuropean Union regulators said last month that they would take a fresh look at the partnership under the 27-nation bloc's antitrust rules, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Britain's competition watchdog have also been examining the pact.\nMicrosoft took the board seat following a power struggle in which OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was fired, then quickly reinstated, while the board members behind the ouster were pushed out.\n\"Over the past eight months we have witnessed significant progress by the newly formed board and are confident in the company\u2019s direction,\" Microsoft said in its letter. \u201cGiven all of this we no longer believe our limited role as an observer is necessary.\u201d\nWith Microsoft's departure, OpenAI will no longer have observer seats on its board.\n\u201cWe are grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership,\" OpenAI said in a statement.\nIt's not hard to conclude that Microsoft's decision to ditch the board seat was heavily influenced by rising scrutiny of big technology companies and their links with AI startups, said Alex Haffner, a competition partner at U.K. law firm Fladgate.\n\u201cIt is clear that regulators are very much focused on the complex web of inter-relationships that Big Tech has created with AI providers, hence the need for Microsoft and others to carefully consider how they structure these arrangements going forward,\u201d he said.\nOpenAI said it would take a new approach to \u201cinforming and engaging key strategic partners\" such as Microsoft and Apple and investors such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures, with regular meetings to update stakeholders on progress and ensure stronger collaboration on safety and security.\n"

You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nMicrosoft's performance in the fourth quarter of 2024 is expected to have shown robust growth, primarily driven by its Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes segments. The company's strategic focus on cloud services, particularly Azure and the Office 365 suite, is likely to have contributed significantly to top-line growth.In the Intelligent Cloud segment, the company anticipates revenues between $28.4 billion and $28.7 billion. Our model estimate for this segment is pegged at $28.54 billion, indicating growth of 19% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. In Azure, Microsoft expects revenue growth in the range of 30-31% at cc. Microsoft's Azure platform is spearheading the company's AI-driven growth strategy.A key factor in Microsoft's growth strategy has been Teams, its enterprise communication platform. Teams has been expanding its customer base and feature set, effectively competing against rivals like Zoom. The platform's growth is closely tied to the rising popularity of hybrid and flexible work models.\u00a0In the quarter under review, Microsoft announced that it is set to sell Teams separately from its Office product globally. The decision comes after the company unbundled the two products in Europe to avert a possible EU antitrust fine.Microsoft anticipates its Productivity and Business Processes segment to generate revenues between $19.9 billion and $20.2 billion. Our model estimate is pegged at $20.03 billion, indicating an increase of 9.5% year over year.This growth is underpinned by strong performance across various product lines. Office 365 Commercial is expected to see revenue growth of approximately 14% at constant currency (cc), which is in line with our model estimate. However, traditional Office Commercial products are projected to experience a decline in the mid-to-high teens range, highlighting the ongoing shift from on-premise to cloud-based solutions.The company's diversified portfolio continues to show promise, with Office Consumer products and cloud services expected to achieve revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digits. LinkedIn is projected to achieve mid-to-high single-digit growth. Our model estimate for LinkedIn is pegged at revenue growth of 6.6%.Dynamics 365, Microsoft's enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management platform, is another steady performer, with the company projecting revenue growth in the low-to-mid teens.\u00a0For the More Personal Computing segment, the company projects revenues between $15.2 billion and $15.6 billion. Revenues from Windows are likely to have been driven by steady traction seen in Windows Commercial products and cloud services growth amid improving personal computer (PC) demand.The Traditional PC market delivered its second quarter of growth following eight consecutive quarters of decline. According to preliminary results from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Personal Computing Device Tracker, worldwide shipments reached 64.9 million units in the second quarter of 2024, representing year-over-year growth of 3%.Among other major PC vendors, Lenovo (LNVGY) and Hewlett Packard (HPE) registered an increase in shipments. Lenovo's shipments increased 3.7% year over year to 14.7 million units, while HPE's shipments grew 1.8% year over year to 13.7 million units. Additionally, Apple (AAPL) registered a 20.8% year-over-year improvement in shipments, reaching 5.7 million units.Microsoft expects Windows OEM revenues to grow in the mid to low-to-mid single-digit range. In the Gaming segment, MSFT expects revenue growth in the low to mid-40s, including roughly 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Furthermore, Microsoft anticipates Xbox content and services revenue growth in the high 50s, driven by roughly 60 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. In the quarter under review, Microsoft announced the renewal of a publishing agreement with NetEase, which will bring back Blizzard Entertainment's games like World of Warcraft to players in China.\nShares of MSFT have returned 17.8% year to date compared with the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s growth of 21.5%. Shares of HPE and AAPL have gained 21.3% and 16.3%, respectively, while shares of LNVGY have declined 2.8%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNow, let\u2019s look at the value Microsoft offers investors at current levels. MSFT is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/S of 11.73X compared with the Zacks Computer - Software industry\u2019s 8.13X and higher than the median of 10.05X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMicrosoft presents a strong investment case with its dominant position in cloud computing (Azure) and productivity software (Office 365), driving consistent revenue growth. The company's strategic focus on AI integration and partnerships, like with OpenAI, positions it at the forefront of technological innovation. Microsoft's diversified portfolio, including gaming (Xbox) and professional networking (LinkedIn), provides stability and multiple growth avenues.\u00a0However, potential challenges include intense competition in the cloud market, particularly from Amazon and Google, and the cyclical nature of enterprise IT spending. Regulatory scrutiny over market dominance and data privacy concerns pose additional risks. Despite these challenges, Microsoft's strong balance sheet, consistent cash flow, and history of shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks make it an attractive option for investors seeking a balance of growth and stability in the tech sector.\nMicrosoft's strong performance in productivity and collaboration offerings is expected to drive substantial growth in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 despite a premium valuation and fierce competition in the cloud market. The company's strategic focus on cloud services, AI integration, and innovative product development has positioned it favorably in the competitive market. Maintaining a position in Microsoft appears prudent at present. Investors looking to buy the stock should, however, wait for a better entry point.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "The yearly results for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) were released last week, making it a good time to revisit its performance. Microsoft reported in line with analyst predictions, delivering revenues of US$245b and statutory earnings per share of US$11.80, suggesting the business is executing well and in line with its plan. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nTaking into account the latest results, the current consensus from Microsoft's 49 analysts is for revenues of US$278.7b in 2025. This would reflect a notable 14% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to expand 11% to US$13.21. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$280.0b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$13.36 in 2025. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\nThere were no changes to revenue or earnings estimates or the price target of US$498, suggesting that the company has met expectations in its recent result. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. The most optimistic Microsoft analyst has a price target of US$600 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$430. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. The period to the end of 2025 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 14% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 13% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 12% annually. It's clear that while Microsoft's revenue growth is expected to continue on its current trajectory, it's only expected to grow in line with the industry itself.\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. They also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, with the company predicted to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$498, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\nWith that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Microsoft going out to 2027, and you can see them free on our platform here..\nYou should always think about risks though.

        "Text": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the second-largest company in the world, with a market cap of around $3.3 trillion, slightly behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). In terms of performance over the past year, it is among the top Magnificent Seven stocks, up more than 18% YTD.\nMicrosoft has beaten consensus estimates for EPS and revenues for the last five quarters. It will report its Q4 2024 earnings on July 30. Wall Street analysts expect the company to post an EPS of $2.93, up from $2.69 in the year-ago period. According to data from Benzinga Pro, quarterly revenue is expected to be $64.35 billion, up from $56.19 billion in the year-ago period.\nDon\u2019t miss out: this property type is nearly recession-proof \u2014 see passive income real estate deals for accredited investors.\nThe 52-week range of Microsoft's stock price was $309.45 to $468.35.\nMicrosoft's dividend yield is 0.87%. It paid $3.68 in dividends during the last 12 months.\nLast week, a widespread Microsoft cloud service disruption grounded and canceled flights for several airlines, including Frontier Group (NASDAQ:ULCC), Allegiant Travel Company (NASDAQ:ALGT), and Sun Country Airlines (NASDAQ:SNCY). Microsoft reported issues with its cloud services in the Central U.S. region, which significantly impacted the operations of several airlines.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Build 2024 conference in May showcased groundbreaking advancements in AI and boosted investors' optimism in the company\u2019s innovative strides and strategic focus on AI. The three-day event focused on providing developers with in-depth sessions on the latest tools and features for Windows 11 and Microsoft 365. This year, significant emphasis is on new AI innovations and enhancements. Here\u2019s a look at some of the biggest announcements from the conference.\nCheck it out: Bezos' favorite real estate platform launches a way to cash in on the private credit boom \u2014 get started for just $100.\nIf you want to make $100 per month\u2014$1,200 annually\u2014from Microsoft dividends, your investment value needs to be approximately $137,931, around 310 shares at $444.09 each.\nUnderstanding the dividend yield calculations: When estimating, you need two key variables \u2013 the desired annual income ($1,200) and the dividend yield (0.87% in this case). So, $1,200 / 0.0087 = $137,931 to generate an income of $100 per month.\nYou can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the stock\u2019s current price.\nThe dividend yield can change over time due to fluctuating stock prices and dividend payments on a rolling basis.\nFor instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40).\nIn summary, investors may find Microsoft stock an attractive option for making a steady passive income of $100 per month by owning around 310 shares of stock, in addition to the significant gains made on its surging stock price. There may be more upside as investors benefit from the company's consistent dividend hikes. Microsoft has raised its dividend consecutively for the last 19 years.\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stories.\nChina and the United States continue to compete against each other as the AI boom continues to reign in the tech industry. On July 2, Reuters reported that China plans to develop 50 new national and industrial standards for artificial intelligence by 2026. The country aims to standardize systems in the artificial intelligence sector by providing thorough guidelines to companies and budding startups. Furthermore, on July 3, Reuters reported that China filed six times more patents than the United States for inventions in AI like chatbots. On a global scale, more than 50,000 patent applications were filed in the past decade, a quarter of which were filed in 2023 alone. China filed 38,000 generative AI applications between 2014 and 2023, while the United States only filed slightly over 6,200 applications during the same period. Of the total applications, ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft filed the largest number of applications. The report added that Chinese patent applications covered a wider range of sectors such as autonomous driving, publishing, and document management. South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.\nThe United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.\nWhile the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.\nOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.\nIn another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.\nAnthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.\nClaude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.\nA lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, which was sourced from Insider Monkey's proprietary database that tracks over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 293\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks second on our list of the best AI stories from this week. The technology company owns multiple platforms backed by artificial intelligence including Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, Power platform, and Microsoft Cloud. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is also reducing its reliance on AI hardware companies to produce efficient infrastructure systems for its AI products. Last year, the company introduced tailored AI chips including the Microsoft Azure Maia AI Accelerator and the Microsoft Azure Cobalt CPU. The Maia AI Accelerator is optimized to run artificial intelligence tasks and generative AI. The Cobalt CPU, on the other hand, is capable of running general-purpose compute workloads on the Microsoft Cloud.\nOverall, Microsoft Cloud reported $35 billion in revenue, up 35% year-over-year. Like Amazon, Microsoft is also big on forging partnerships with groundbreaking startups. Earlier this year, the company partnered with Mistral AI, an artificial intelligence company based in France. Mistral AI is capable of bridging communication gaps across different languages. Under the partnership, Mistral AI will gain access to Azure's AI infrastructure to help them develop the next generation of large language models.\nThe company's efforts in AI do not end here. Two weeks ago, on June 17, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced its efforts to empower scientists with AI-augmented scientific discoveries at companies like Unilever. Its Azure Quantum Elements platform is a groundbreaking addition to Microsoft's suite of AI products. The platform offers two distinct capabilities including Generative Chemistry and Accelerated DTF. The platform is capable of exploring novel molecular structures at groundbreaking speed and scale. Moreover, it can also dissect and simulate chemical and molecular structures. The platform will be able to expedite chemical research, compressing 250 years of research to only 25.\n293 investors were bullish on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) at the close of Q1 2024, with total stakes amounting to $88.16 billion.

        "Text": "The 2024 Q2 earnings season picks up considerable steam this week, with a notably busy reporting docket. We\u2019ll hear from many different companies, a list that includes several cloud computing players such as Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN.\nBoth stocks have been sensitive to their cloud results, often dictating the post-earnings move. We already heard from another notable cloud player, Alphabet GOOGL, and the results provided some insight into what to expect from MSFT and AMZN. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nAlphabet\u2019s quarterly release was overall positive. The company enjoyed 31% EPS growth on nearly 14% higher sales. Both figures exceeded our consensus expectations, building on its recent streak of quarterly positivity.\nCloud showed great growth, with revenues of $10.3 billion nearly 30% higher year-over-year and reflecting a quarterly record. In addition, operating income from Google Cloud saw a sizable jump, reported at $900 million vs. $191 million in the year-ago period.\nOverall, the results were positive, but shares faced pressure following the release due to some uncertainty about AI CapEx. Alphabet has regularly exceeded our consensus cloud expectations as of late, as shown below.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nCloud revenue growth of 23% year-over-year positively shocked investors in its latest release, showing stabilization after a few periods of slowing growth rates. Earnings and revenue expectations have overall remained stable over recent months, with the company expected to enjoy 8% EPS growth on 14% higher sales.\nRecent cloud results from the company have consistently exceeded our consensus expectations, as shown below. For the upcoming release, the $28.7 billion estimate suggests a 20% climb from the year-ago period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAWS delivered great results in the company\u2019s latest period, with net sales of $25 billion showing 17% year-over-year growth and snapping a recent streak of negative surprises on the metric. For the upcoming print, the Zacks Consensus estimate for Cloud revenue stands at $25.9 billion, reflecting a 17.2% Y/Y climb.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings and revenue expectations for the upcoming release have primarily been muted, but big growth is expected, with EPS expected to be up 63% on 10% higher sales. Easing costs and operational efficiencies have aided profitability in a big way, leading to meaningful margin expansion.\nPlease note that the chart below is on a trailing twelve-month basis.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSeveral major cloud players report this week, a list that includes Mag 7 members Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT. Google parent Alphabet GOOGL recently unveiled its cloud results, which were overall positive and showed great growth.\nInvestors will undoubtedly be laser-focused on the Y/Y growth rates these cloud businesses will post, as a deceleration could cause some spooks.

        "Text": "Microsoft is set to announce its fiscal Q4 2024 financial results on July 30, after the market close, a report that will be closely watched by the market for insights into AI adoption rates.\nWedbush analysts maintained an Outperform rating on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock ahead of the release, keeping it on their Best Ideas List.\n\"Our checks for Microsoft have been robust this quarter again as we believe the AI tidal wave with Redmond in the driver's seat is accelerating cloud deal flow for Azure with strong momentum into the rest of 2024/2025,\u201d they said in a note.\nThe investment firm expects a strong performance for the June quarter, with Microsoft projected to surpass the consensus estimates of $64.37 billion in revenue and $2.93 in earnings per share (EPS).\nWedbush believes that the Intelligent Cloud is likely to be a key area of upside. The most critical metric will be Azure growth, with the Street's target set at 30%, a figure analysts think Microsoft can exceed given the high level of deal activity from its core enterprise customers.\n\u201cWe strongly view this as Microsoft's \"iPhone Moment\" with AI set to change the cloud growth trajectory in Redmond the next few years and recent checks giving further confidence in this dynamic,\u201d analysts noted.\nTheir research indicates that over the next three years, more than 70% of Microsoft's installed base will adopt AI-driven functionality, fundamentally altering the landscape for the company.\nAnalysts believe the stock has yet to fully reflect the anticipated wave of cloud and AI growth, as enterprise AI use cases are expected to drive more budget allocations toward AI in 2024/2025. Citing their partner checks around Copilot deployments, Wedbush notes that this could add an additional $25 billion to Microsoft's top line by the fiscal year 2025 (FY25).\nFurthermore, the firm estimates that for every $100 spent on Azure cloud services in recent years, there will be an additional $40 allocated to AI spending moving forward.\nWedbush's thesis remains that the cloud, along with the Office 365/Windows ecosystem, will constitute a larger portion of Microsoft's revenue, driving accelerated growth and margins into FY25.\nRelated Articles\nWedbush: Microsoft earnings to reveal big cloud, AI momentum\nTech valuations have become attractive again: UBS\nCommodities fall, stocks steady ahead of Fed, BOJ rate decisions\n"

The company's update noted that connectively issues for \u201ca subset\" of Microsoft services began at around 11:45 a.m. UTC (7:45 a.m. EST) Tuesday and lasted nearly eight hours.\n\u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused,\u201d Azure Support wrote on social media platform X Wednesday morning.\nOutage reports were somewhat scattered Tuesday \u2014 with a handful of companies and services seeing user complaints that numbered in the hundreds or low thousands on outage tracker Downdetector. But there appeared to be a range in reach. Issues were reported by Minecraft video game players, Dutch football club FC Twente, the U.K. government's HM Courts and Tribunals Service and more. Many found workarounds or said that services were restored in a matter of hours.\nSome Starbucks customers, who were also among those impacted, were \u201cbriefly unable to access the mobile order and pay feature in the Starbucks app due to a third-party system outage\u201d on Tuesday, company spokesperson Jaci Anderson told The Associated Press \u2014 but by early afternoon, that had largely been restored.\nIn a statement sent to the AP Wednesday, Microsoft confirmed that the service interruption was \u201cfully resolved\u201d and pointed to Azure's status page for more details. According to Azure's mitigation update, the company plans to publish a preliminary post-incident report within 72 hours.\nTuesday's Azure troubles arrived less than two weeks after millions of Windows-powered computers worldwide were disrupted by a faulty software update by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike.\nAnd Microsoft itself is already under the microscope for cybersecurity practices. In April, a federal cybersecurity review board issued a report alleging that a \u201ccascade of errors\u201d by the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant let state-backed Chinese cyber operators break into email accounts of senior U.S. officials.\nThe report described shoddy cybersecurity practices, a lax corporate culture and a lack of sincerity about the company\u2019s knowledge of the targeted breach, which affected multiple U.S. agencies that deal with China.\nIt concluded that \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s security culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul\u201d given the company\u2019s ubiquity and critical role in the global technology ecosystem.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella repeatedly described cybersecurity as a top priority for the company on an earnings call Tuesday.\n___________\nAP Reporters Matt O'Brien in Providence, Rhode Island, and Dee-Ann Durbin in Detroit contributed to this report.\n"

        "Title": "Could Microsoft Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) have jumped 33% over the last 12 months, outperforming the S&P 500's already-impressive increase of 25%. The growth saw Microsoft surpass Apple as the world's most-valuable company, achieving a market capitalization above $3 trillion.\nThe company has rallied Wall Street by becoming one of the biggest threats in artificial intelligence (AI), an industry projected to hit nearly $2 trillion in spending by 2030. Meanwhile, consistent earnings gains, significant cash reserves, and leading positions in multiple areas of tech have made Microsoft's stock one of the most reliable investments out there.\nSo, here's why Microsoft stock could make you a millionaire with the right investment.\nMicrosoft's diversified revenue streams have instilled long-term reliability in its business. Its strength was most prevalent during an economic downturn in 2022. During the challenging year, rival Amazon's revenue rose 9% year over year while its operating income declined by nearly 50%. However, the same period saw Microsoft's revenue and operating income rise 7% and 6%, still delivering profit growth despite the marketwide pullback from consumers.\nAs a result, Amazon's stock fell 50% in 2022, while Microsoft's tumbled a more moderate 29%.\nMicrosoft owes much of its reliability to its varied activities in tech. The company offers investors the opportunity to back multiple industries, such as productivity software, cloud computing, digital advertising, video games, consumer products, AI, and more. That's before even considering Microsoft's dominance in sectors like operating systems with Windows and recent growth in its search engine, Bing.\nIts diversified business model has delivered consistent earnings and stock growth over the years, allowing Microsoft to keep investing in new opportunities like AI. The company invested $1 billion in the ChatGPT developer in 2019 and has since increased that figure to about $13 billion.\nThe partnership has allowed Microsoft to bring AI upgrades to many of its products, including launching its AI assistant Copilot through its Microsoft 365 productivity suite. The new feature is a $30 monthly add-on to a 365 subscription and shows the company beginning to monetize its AI offerings.\nMicrosoft has growth catalysts across tech that will likely keep its stock price rising for decades.\nShares in Microsoft have steadily risen 237% over the last five years and 958% in the last decade. The company has proven time and time again its worth as a long-term growth stock. As a result, it's an excellent option for investors looking for stocks to buy that will passively grow over the years.\nMicrosoft's free cash flow hit $71 billion this year, more than competitors Amazon or Alphabet. The figure suggests Microsoft is potentially best equipped to keep investing in its business and overcome unforeseen hurdles.\nMeanwhile, recent earnings gave a promising glimpse into the company's long-term future. In the third quarter of 2024 (which ended in March), Microsoft's revenue rose 17% year over year to $62 billion, beating Wall Street estimates by more than $1 billion.

Microsoft and G42 have pledged to team up on multiple projects in coming years, leveraging the UAE\u2019s regional ties.\nBut already there\u2019s growing concern in Washington that relying on Microsoft, G42 and the Emirati government could imperil national security \u2014 and without US officials on board, the firms won\u2019t be able to get the technology they need to make their partnership a success.\nThe linchpin of the two companies\u2019 relationship is an agreement, blessed earlier this year by the Biden administration, for Microsoft to invest $1.5 billion in the UAE firm in exchange for G42\u2019s agreement to cut ties with Chinese companies. Pentagon officials are skeptical G42 will entirely uncouple from China, according to people familiar with the situation.\nMicrosoft\u2019s chronic cybersecurity failures, enumerated recently in a scathing government report, also have stoked fears that foreign powers could access sensitive US networks. Other officials wonder if it\u2019s a good idea shipping advanced AI to Gulf states with questionable human-rights records.\nThe most immediate question is whether to approve shipments to the Middle East of Nvidia Corp.\u2019s H100 chips, semiconductors used in AI data centers. Some officials have come to see the issue as tantamount to nuclear proliferation, with Nvidia chips as the most desired weapon in an AI arms race.\nWhile the Biden administration hashes out a broader regional strategy, it has slowed license approvals for high-volume AI chip shipments to the entire Gulf. It\u2019s unclear whether those approvals will be granted, but US officials are hoping to reach a consensus in the coming months, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe resistance to the G42-Microsoft deal could hinder the administration\u2019s efforts to help US companies grab a global lead in the development of artificial intelligence, which is already emerging as the next front in Washington\u2019s Cold War with Beijing. US officials want to make sure that American firms \u2014 not their Chinese rivals \u2014 benefit from Gulf states\u2019 ambitions to fund and build big AI projects. By dangling the promise of access to American technology, they hope to persuade Middle Eastern states to sever ties to Beijing.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working closely with the National Security Council and Department of Commerce, and US national security will continue to be a principal priority,\u201d Microsoft spokesperson David Cuddy said in an emailed statement.\nThe Pentagon, Commerce and G42 declined to comment. The NSC didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nThe US government has long partnered with big business to extend America\u2019s geopolitical reach. And the Biden administration is no exception \u2014 touting a series of so-called economic corridors that promise local jobs and investment.\nSo far, these efforts mostly pale in comparison to Chinese investments in developing countries. Since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, US officials have gone all but silent on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor \u2014 an effort to link the emerging industrial powers of South Asia with Europe. Biden also has trumpeted the Lobito Corridor, a rail project through the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia and Angola, but the policy has been criticized for echoing Chinese efforts and focusing on resource extraction rather than sustainable business.\nOf the various efforts so far, the deal that Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo worked on with the Emiratis, Microsoft and G42 holds the most promise \u2014 if Washington can find a way to get comfortable with it. The UAE has the money and ties to the Global South. Microsoft has the technology and, in President Brad Smith, a kind of corporate secretary of state who has developed relationships around the globe. G42\u2019s Khazna division, a subsidiary that has built data centers in the UAE, is now expanding across Africa and Asia.\nKenya is a logical place to establish a foothold. With its fast-growing, youthful and increasingly tech-savvy population, the East African nation has emerged as a rival tech hub to Nigeria and South Africa. Nicknamed Silicon Savannah, Kenya has a vibrant startup ecosystem and is home to M-Pesa, a thriving fintech company that provides mobile financial services.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Smith says the nation reminds him of Southeast Asia in the early 1990s. \u201cYou see this enormous potential,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s important to the United States. China recognizes that as well.\u201d\nIn 2022, Biden named veteran tech executive Meg Whitman US ambassador to Kenya. The former Hewlett-Packard chief quickly established herself as a bridge between Kenyan officials and US tech leaders, last year accompanying President Ruto on a tour of Silicon Valley, with stops at Google and Apple Inc. In May, Google announced plans to build an undersea fiber-optic cable connecting Australia to Kenya and six other African nations.\nStill, operating in Kenya is challenging. Last month, protests forced Ruto to withdraw a law that would have raised taxes to help stabilize the country\u2019s finances. Kenyans stormed the National Assembly, chanting \u201cRuto Must Go,\u201d and as many as two dozen people were killed when the police opened fire. Ruto\u2019s reversal means Kenya will now struggle to balance its budget and pay its creditors.\nCorruption is endemic. Money laundering is an issue. And the US Treasury recently sanctioned a number of Kenyan entities for their links to terrorist funding. The country is also struggling to build out its physical infrastructure, including adequate roads and transport systems, water and power capacity. A State Department spokesperson said the US is working closely with the Kenyan government to \u201ccreate a business-friendly environment,\u201d and encourages companies to embrace opportunities there.\nCompeting with China, let alone dislodging it, won\u2019t be easy. As part of Beijing\u2019s Digital Silk Road effort, Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. have long targeted the Global South, dangling state-backed loans, discounted hardware, training and technical help. Huawei has played a key role in helping to build and fund a $14.5 billion \u201csmart city\u201d in Kenya called Konza Technopolis.\nMany African nations have based their IT systems on Chinese standards for digital data, a regulatory environment Microsoft could struggle to navigate, according to Olena Borodyna, a senior geopolitical risks advisor for ODI, a global affairs think tank. The company also could be outmaneuvered by Chinese firms that have spent years doing business there. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like selling a Tesla in Kenya or Uzbekistan,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see Chinese cars. You don\u2019t see many Teslas. It\u2019s the same story in digital infrastructure.\u201d\nThe key advantage the US has over China \u2014 for the moment \u2014 is a distinct lead in cloud computing and the large language models undergirding AI. But much will depend on Washington\u2019s willingness to deploy the technology.\n\u201cIn a place like the UAE, where you have G42 working very closely with Huawei, for example, we have an interest in changing that picture,\u201d Tarun Chhabra, the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for technology, said at a Council on Foreign Relations event in late June. \u201cWe see the effort to work with Microsoft as an alternative to Huawei as generally a positive development \u2014 and one that we want to encourage.\u201d However, he also said it will take time to transition from \u201can untrusted vendor.\u201d\nThe US curbed the sale of advanced chips and semiconductor equipment to China in 2022, and added much of the Gulf region to that framework last year. Commerce Department officials have been talking with their counterparts in the UAE and other affected countries about the export license process for high-end chips including Nvidia\u2019s, as well as strategies to safeguard sensitive technology, people familiar with the situation have said. G42\u2019s chairman, UAE National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, discussed the matter during a visit to Washington and Seattle in early June, other people said.\nThe US government\u2019s licensing decision hinges in part on how well Microsoft and G42 can secure the chips once they\u2019re in the data centers. One possibility is that Microsoft will put the most sensitive technology in a restricted-access area, something the company has done before. Others have thrown out ideas like putting a kill switch on the Nvidia chips, according to several people familiar with the conversations, or having the entire operation remotely controlled from the US. Microsoft has also pledged to follow so-called know-your-customer rules to determine who is using its data centers, and won\u2019t allow Chinese customers to train their models.\nAll of this is predicated on G42 removing Chinese gear from its supply chains. In recent months, the company hired a third-party auditor to determine whether it\u2019s abiding by those terms, several people said, prompting some US officials to worry that the large sum G42 is paying amounts to a conflict of interest. Asked how the US will enforce such agreements, the NSC\u2019s Chhabra said it will \u201cvary by context.\u201d That could mean direct diplomatic talks, he said, or it might include a push from a \u201cUS vendor that itself is going to want those assurances \u2014 because they generally want to continue working with the US government.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a growing feeling on Capitol Hill that the Microsoft-G42 deal needs congressional oversight. Several bipartisan staff delegations have visited the UAE in recent weeks, according to a House Foreign Affairs Committee Republican staffer who was briefed on the trips, with more outreach to come. The goal, the staffer said, is to make the UAE cognizant of growing concerns in Washington \u2014 and make clear that they need to honor their commitments, whatever they may be.\n--With assistance from Loni Prinsloo, Michelle Jamrisko, Kate O'Keeffe and Olivia Solon.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Stocks Became the Game That Record Numbers of Americans Are Playing\nThe Rich Investor Club Is Getting Crowded\nPsychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing\nOnline Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Last month, protests forced Ruto to withdraw a law that would have raised taxes to help stabilize the country\u2019s finances. Kenyans stormed the National Assembly, chanting \u201cRuto Must Go,\u201d and as many as two dozen people were killed when the police opened fire. Ruto\u2019s reversal means Kenya will now struggle to balance its budget and pay its creditors.\nCorruption is endemic. Money laundering is an issue. And the US Treasury recently sanctioned a number of Kenyan entities for their links to terrorist funding. The country is also struggling to build out its physical infrastructure, including adequate roads and transport systems, water and power capacity. A State Department spokesperson said the US is working closely with the Kenyan government to \u201ccreate a business-friendly environment,\u201d and encourages companies to embrace opportunities there.\nCompeting with China, let alone dislodging it, won\u2019t be easy. As part of Beijing\u2019s Digital Silk Road effort, Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. have long targeted the Global South, dangling state-backed loans, discounted hardware, training and technical help. Huawei has played a key role in helping to build and fund a $14.5 billion \u201csmart city\u201d in Kenya called Konza Technopolis.\nMany African nations have based their IT systems on Chinese standards for digital data, a regulatory environment Microsoft could struggle to navigate, according to Olena Borodyna, a senior geopolitical risks advisor for ODI, a global affairs think tank. The company also could be outmaneuvered by Chinese firms that have spent years doing business there. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like selling a Tesla in Kenya or Uzbekistan,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see Chinese cars. You don\u2019t see many Teslas. It\u2019s the same story in digital infrastructure.\u201d\nThe key advantage the US has over China \u2014 for the moment \u2014 is a distinct lead in cloud computing and the large language models undergirding AI. But much will depend on Washington\u2019s willingness to deploy the technology.\n\u201cIn a place like the UAE, where you have G42 working very closely with Huawei, for example, we have an interest in changing that picture,\u201d Tarun Chhabra, the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for technology, said at a Council on Foreign Relations event in late June. \u201cWe see the effort to work with Microsoft as an alternative to Huawei as generally a positive development \u2014 and one that we want to encourage.\u201d However, he also said it will take time to transition from \u201can untrusted vendor.\u201d\nThe US curbed the sale of advanced chips and semiconductor equipment to China in 2022, and added much of the Gulf region to that framework last year. Commerce Department officials have been talking with their counterparts in the UAE and other affected countries about the export license process for high-end chips including Nvidia\u2019s, as well as strategies to safeguard sensitive technology, people familiar with the situation have said. G42\u2019s chairman, UAE National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, discussed the matter during a visit to Washington and Seattle in early June, other people said.\nThe US government\u2019s licensing decision hinges in part on how well Microsoft and G42 can secure the chips once they\u2019re in the data centers. One possibility is that Microsoft will put the most sensitive technology in a restricted-access area, something the company has done before. Others have thrown out ideas like putting a kill switch on the Nvidia chips, according to several people familiar with the conversations, or having the entire operation remotely controlled from the US. Microsoft has also pledged to follow so-called know-your-customer rules to determine who is using its data centers, and won\u2019t allow Chinese customers to train their models.\nAll of this is predicated on G42 removing Chinese gear from its supply chains. In recent months, the company hired a third-party auditor to determine whether it\u2019s abiding by those terms, several people said, prompting some US officials to worry that the large sum G42 is paying amounts to a conflict of interest. Asked how the US will enforce such agreements, the NSC\u2019s Chhabra said it will \u201cvary by context.\u201d That could mean direct diplomatic talks, he said, or it might include a push from a \u201cUS vendor that itself is going to want those assurances \u2014 because they generally want to continue working with the US government.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a growing feeling on Capitol Hill that the Microsoft-G42 deal needs congressional oversight. Several bipartisan staff delegations have visited the UAE in recent weeks, according to a House Foreign Affairs Committee Republican staffer who was briefed on the trips, with more outreach to come. The goal, the staffer said, is to make the UAE cognizant of growing concerns in Washington \u2014 and make clear that they need to honor their commitments, whatever they may be.\n--With assistance from Loni Prinsloo, Michelle Jamrisko, Kate O'Keeffe and Olivia Solon.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Stocks Became the Game That Record Numbers of Americans Are Playing\nThe Rich Investor Club Is Getting Crowded\nPsychedelics Are Now Legal in Australia\u2014With a Catch\nDragons and Sex Are Now a $610 Million Business Sweeping Publishing\nOnline Shopping Warehouses Are Reshaping Rural America\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- The recent outage on Microsoft Corp.\u2019s cloud-computer platform demonstrated the persistence of an older, blunt-force style of cyberattack.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSinger Akon\u2019s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice\nNew York City\u2019s Outdoor Dining Sheds Will Start Disappearing\nThe 5 Coastal States That Face the Most Devastating Flood Risk\nParis Spent \u20ac1.4 Billion to Clean Up the Seine. Has It Worked?\nAfrica\u2019s Richest City Needs $12 Billion to Fix Infrastructure\nIt\u2019s called a distributed denial-of-service attack, DDoS for short, and it works by directing massive amounts of junk internet traffic at a target, like a website or server, to disrupt it or even knock it offline. It\u2019s become a favorite tool of hacktivists seeking to make a statement by targeting government institutions, banks or major companies.\nThe attack on Microsoft started Tuesday morning, hours before the technology giant was scheduled to announce quarterly earnings. Customers of its Azure cloud platform faced outages for hours. Mobile ordering at Starbucks Corp. was down, as were certain online services from the UK government\u2019s courts and tribunals service and the Dutch football club FC Twente. Microsoft 365, which includes popular applications like Outlook and Excel, was also impacted.\nTo make matters worse, an error in Microsoft\u2019s automated defense mechanism \u201camplified\u201d the attack instead of mitigating it, the company said in a status update.\nDDoS attacks were once considered a \u201csolved problem,\u201d according to Boaz Gelbord, chief security officer at Akamai Technologies Inc. \u201cAttackers could clog the pipes, and then providers could buy bigger pipes, and then they\u2019d be safe from DDoS.\u201d\nBut today, they are cheaper and easier than ever and can even be purchased on the dark web for as little as $11, according to Akamai.\n\u201cOne of the phenomena we\u2019ve seen in recent years is DDoS attacks resurging,\u201d Gelbord said.\u201cThey\u2019re a problem for small sites, but especially now for enterprise companies. It used to be the opposite.\u201d\nDDoS attacks, which have been around for decades, aim to flood web servers with so much traffic that they become virtually inaccessible to legitimate users. The proliferation of internet-connected devices has helped intensify the attacks. Specialized malware is used to infect everything from smart TVs and fitness trackers to baby monitors and video cameras. The malware weaves those infected devices into a single network known as a \u201cbotnet,\u201d a zombie army that can be directed to overwhelm servers with millions of requests at once.\nAside from making political statements, DDoS attacks are sometimes part of broader extortion schemes in which hackers seek a payment to make them stop. It\u2019s not yet clear who was behind the Microsoft attacks.\nDDoS mitigation efforts often involve filtering out malicious traffic. However, requests from bots \u2014 those zombie computers \u2014 can look nearly identical to requests from real users, said Pavel Odintsov, chief technology officer of DDoS-mitigation company FastNetMon. Odintsov and five other DDoS experts told Bloomberg News that Microsoft likely exacerbated the impacts of Tuesday\u2019s attack by blocking out real Azure users in its attempt to isolate illegitimate ones.\nA Microsoft spokesperson said \u201ca network device misconfiguration\u201d contributed to the service interruption, but didn\u2019t provide further details. The company is still investigating the Azure outage, which has now been fully resolved, the spokesperson said.\n\u201cWhen you have a hammer, everything is a nail,\u201d Odintsov said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to make a mistake and block real customers.\u201d Over the past four years, Odintsov said, the number of DDoS attacks his company has observed has approximately doubled each year.\nDDoS attacks are getting tougher to defend against, Gelbord said, because botnets are getting bigger and more accessible. With an ever-increasing number of web-connected devices and gadgets, cybercriminals have more potential electronic devices to enlist as unwitting participants in their attacks. \u201cYou have much more readily available botnet armies,\u201d Gelbord said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an industry. You can rent them for hire, fairly inexpensively.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA, jointly warned of potential DDoS attacks during the upcoming 2024 US presidential election. The attacks have been used in the past to target election infrastructure, and the government agencies said they will likely be used again for the same purpose.\nIn Venezuela, DDoS attacks have spiked tenfold since President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declared victory in a disputed election, according to NetScout Systems Inc. Political demonstrations have erupted on the streets of Caracas to protest what some are calling a fraudulent win.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a specific hacktivist group, but a form of digital protest to real-world events,\u201d said Richard Hummel, a senior threat intelligence manager at NetScout. \u201cThis is cyberactivity where adversaries are trying to effect chaos.\u201d\n--With assistance from Charles Gorrivan.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMark Zuckerberg Is Laughing at Zuck Memes, Too\nMade-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products\u2014and Broke Shopping in America\nForty-Eight Hours at the MAGA-fied Crypto Lovefest\nThe Future of Junk Food Could Be Healthy Food\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

This employee's laptop display was stuck on a blue screen with the message, \"Recovery. It looks like Windows didn't load correctly.\"\nThe company's information technology support then instructed everyone to shut down their computers, wait for further instructions and use mobile apps for instant messaging. The employee's accounting work was subsequently delayed by the outage. \"This month's [financial] report will be late,\" according to the staffer.\nAn employee from another foreign firm also reported experiencing blue screens around 1pm. While some of the employees could later restart their computers, they still could not access the company's website, which displayed a \"502 Bad Gateway\" error. The company told staff that \"global IT support has activated the highest level of response to address the issue\", according to the employee.\nOn Xiaohongshu, an Instagram-like Chinese social media platform, multiple users complained about the difficulty in checking into international franchise hotels such as Sheraton, Marriott and Hyatt in Chinese cities.\nAs China's public services largely remained unaffected, Microsoft's China website and social media channels did not issue any emergency notices. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\nChina's relative immunity to the outage showed the country's reduced reliance on foreign service providers such as Microsoft and the antivirus company CrowdStrike.

        "Author": "  Paolo Confino ",
        "Text": "Microsoft will require its employees in China to only use iPhones due to their enhanced security features.\nThe move comes as Microsoft undertakes a major cybersecurity overhaul. The project, internally known as the Secure Future Initiative, comes after Microsoft faced scrutiny for its subpar security practices. Microsoft\u2019s new policy, which will go into effect in September, means that employees in China will only be allowed to use iPhones for work, as first reported by Bloomberg. The new rule is meant to effectively limit the number of Android phones used by Microsoft\u2019s Chinese employees.\nMicrosoft will begin requiring employees to verify their identities and use two-factor authentication when logging into their work phones.\nMicrosoft had to ask its employees to only use iPhones for work because certain security apps like Microsoft Authenticator and the Identity Pass app weren\u2019t available on any other operating systems in China. In the U.S. and other countries, those two apps are also available on Google Play. But Google Play doesn\u2019t operate in China, which means Microsoft\u2019s employees could only get the relevant security apps on an Apple iPhone.\n\u201cDue to the lack of availability of Google Mobile Services in this region, we look to offer employees a means of accessing these required apps, such as an iOS device,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson told Fortune in an email.\nEmployees in China who don\u2019t have an iPhone will be given one by Microsoft, according to Bloomberg.\nChinese Android phones made by companies like Huawei and Xiaomi operate their own platforms. Microsoft\u2019s banning of Chinese smartphones is emblematic of a diverging digital ecosystem between China and the U.S. where the two governments and major corporations that work with them have become increasingly wary of allowing the other to access sensitive materials.\nChina has its own search engines and social media platforms, where U.S. giants like Facebook are banned. Its internet censors are legendary for their breadth and strictness. Meanwhile, in the U.S. the White House has limited exports of the most sophisticated semiconductor technology to Chinese companies. And Congress passed a bill that would force the sale of the Chinese-owned TikTok to an American buyer over concerns the social media platform could be used to influence public opinion.\nCyber security became a top priority for Microsoft after it was found its cloud systems were breached by state-backed Chinese hackers last year. The cyber attack came ahead of Secretary of State Anthony Blinken\u2019s visit to Beijing in June 2023, further exacerbating tensions between the U.S. and China. The hack raised major red flags about Microsoft\u2019s security practices. In April a federal agency released a scathing report that found \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s security culture was inadequate.\u201d\nIn March, a U.S. federal court charged a group of Chinese hackers for a separate set of cyber attacks that took place in 2018. The Chinese embassy in Washington D.C. said the charges were baseless. \u201cWithout valid evidence, the U.S. jumped to an unwarranted conclusion and made groundless accusations against China,\u201d Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the embassy said at the time.\nAs the relationship between the U.S. and China becomes more fraught, both sides have tried to firewall the others\u2019 cyber capabilities. Since 2023, Chinese government-backed companies have ordered employees to stop using foreign smartphones from manufacturers like Apple and Samsung. Meanwhile China has attempted to surveil parts of the U.S. with its own surreptitious methods. Early last year China sent several spy balloons into the U.S. Even electric vehicles and connected cars have been caught in the crosshairs, seen as a covert way to surveil Americans. The Biden administration is weighing a ban of all Chinese smart cars after a national security investigation found they collect data on passengers and use external sensors to gather information on U.S. infrastructure. A recent Fortune investigation found China\u2019s self-driving cars have already traveled 1.8 million miles on American roads.\nThose tensions have only grown after a report published on Tuesday by an Australian-led consortium of intelligence agencies including those from the U.S., U.K., Japan, and Germany detailed repeated cyber attacks from China\u2019s top spy agency.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Midnight Blizzard likely intended to check if the credentials were valid, presumably with the larger intention of breaching the VA\u2019s network, the officials said.\nThe agency changed the exposed credentials, along with log-in details across their Microsoft environments, once they were notified of the intrusion, they said.

The Peace Corps declined further comment.\nBloomberg News asked other federal agencies for comment, and none of the others disclosed that they were impacted by Midnight Blizzard\u2019s attack on Microsoft. Bloomberg previously reported that more than a dozen Texas state agencies and public universities were exposed by the Russian hack.\nMidnight Blizzard, also known in secularity circles as \u201cCozy Bear\u201d and \u201cAPT29,\u201d is part of Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence service, according to US and UK authorities.\nIn April, US federal agencies were ordered to analyze emails, reset compromise passwords and work to secure Microsoft cloud accounts amid fears that Midnight Blizzard may have accessed correspondence. Microsoft has been notifying some customers in the months since then that their emails with the tech giant were accessed by the Russian hackers.\nThe Midnight Blizzard breach was one in a series of high-profile and damaging security failures at the Redmond, Washington-based technology company, which has drawn strong condemnation by the US government.

There is currently no known impact on 999 so people should use these services as they usually would in emergency situations.\u201d\nIn the US, Kaiser Permanente, with its network of hospitals and medical offices, activated its national command centre to manage widespread effects, The New York Times reported citing spokesperson Steve Shivinsky.\nBanner Health, operating in six states, closed several outpatient facilities, although hospitals remained open for inpatient care.\nProvidence Health, with 52 hospitals and 1,000 clinics, also experienced significant disruptions.\nWhile patient records were still accessible via mobile devices, critical applications, including those used in surgeries, were down, leading to numerous cancellations, stated Providence chief information officer BJ Moore.\nThe system's 15,000 servers were offline, and approximately 40,000 out of 150,000 computers experienced failures.\nMore than 1,000 personnel, including some in India, are working to resolve the outage at Providence Health, with full restoration expected to take weeks, Moore estimated.\n\"Global healthcare systems face disruptions caused by Microsoft outage\" was originally created and published by Hospital Management, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

For example, mobile ordering at Starbucks Corp. was disabled for hours because of the issues affecting Azure, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nDenial-of-service attacks direct internet traffic at a website in mass volume to disrupt it or shut it down. The incidents have become a persistent annoyance for financial institutions, causing intermittent downtime and forcing security staffers to repel the activity.\nReports of outages on Azure and Microsoft 365 began to spike shortly after 7 a.m. in New York and comprised hundreds of complaints at the incident\u2019s peak, according to user reports compiled by Downdetector. Microsoft said the incident was fixed by about 5 p.m. in New York.\nThe issue also affected multiple Microsoft 365 services and features, Microsoft said in a post on social network X. Microsoft 365 includes common productivity applications like Outlook, Word and Excel.\nMobile ordering for Starbucks had largely been restored by about 1 p.m. in New York. The company was working to address limited interruptions that continued, a Starbucks spokesperson said.\nEarlier this month, some 8 million computers running on the Windows operating system crashed after the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. released a flawed software update. In addition, Microsoft has also been grappling with the fallout from a series of cyberattacks that prompted the US government to issue a scathing report calling for companywide changes.\nMicrosoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella touted progress in the company\u2019s cybersecurity products during a conference call Tuesday after the company reported quarterly earnings. He said the company has more than 1.2 million security customers.\n\u201cWe continue to prioritize security above all else,\u201d Nadella said.\n(Updates throughout to indicate outage began as cyberattack.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products\u2014and Broke Shopping in America\nHow to Calculate the Value of an MBA\nDC Welcomes Ex-OpenAI Board Member After Sam Altman Drama\nThe Future of Junk Food Could Be Healthy Food\nInside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

CISPE had argued Microsoft made it too difficult for customers to change cloud providers by tying its business software to its Azure cloud services.\n\u201cAfter working with CISPE and its European members for more than a year, I am pleased that we\u2019ve not only resolved their concerns of the past, but also worked together to define a path forward that brings even more competition to the cloud computing market in Europe and beyond,\u201d Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in the statement.\nThe agreement will allow CISPE members to use enhanced Microsoft Azure features, with service providers permitted to offer Microsoft applications and services on their local cloud infrastructures, the association said in a statement.\nA European Commission spokesperson said it would assess the impact of the settlement on competition in European cloud markets.\nThe deal however was not offered to CISPE\u2019s largest member, Amazon Web Services or to Google\u2019s Cloud Platform and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s cloud service, CISPE said.\nAWS said in a statement that the settlement \u201cdoes nothing for the vast majority of Microsoft customers who are still unable to use the cloud of their choice in Europe and around the world.\u201d\nThe agreement between Microsoft and CISPE puts an end to a long-running back-and-forth between the parties, that saw Microsoft make a spate of concessions in order to appease the concerns of cloud service providers. On the heels of those complaints, EU regulators had been informally asking market rivals and customers about Microsoft\u2019s conduct.\n\u201cWe are exploring our options to continue to fight against Microsoft\u2019s anti-competitive licensing in order to promote choice, innovation, and the growth of the digital economy in Europe,\u201d Amit Zavery, head of platform at Google Cloud, said.\nMicrosoft is no stranger to EU antitrust scrutiny and in previous decades fought a long battle with regulators over abuses linked to the market dominance of Windows.\nMore recently, its $13 billion investment into OpenAI Inc. is the focus of an informal investigation by regulators, after concerns emerged about the AI firm\u2019s exclusive use of Microsoft\u2019s cloud technology. In June, the EU also accused the company of abusing its market power by bundling the Teams video-conferencing app to its other business software.\n(Updates with European Commission comment in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla\nLooser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom\nUkraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs\nAsia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel\nFrench Elections Result Is Least Worst Outcome for Business\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has avoided the threat of a lengthy European Union antitrust probe into its cloud business after it brokered a deal with an Amazon.com Inc.-backed trade lobby that had complained about its software license agreements.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBlackRock Says Gunman From Trump Rally Appeared in Firm\u2019s Ad\nTrump Shooting Changes Biden\u2019s Plan to Revive 2024 Campaign\nTrump Taps Vance as Running Mate, Picking Populist Protege\nTrump Classified Documents Case Dismissed by Florida Judge\nBold and Bloodied Trump Seizes the Moment After Being Shot\nThe association of Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe struck a deal with Microsoft on Wednesday that will see the lobby withdraw its complaint to the EU\u2019s competition department, Microsoft said in a statement. CISPE had argued Microsoft made it too difficult for customers to change cloud providers by tying its business software to its Azure cloud services.\n\u201cAfter working with CISPE and its European members for more than a year, I am pleased that we\u2019ve not only resolved their concerns of the past, but also worked together to define a path forward that brings even more competition to the cloud computing market in Europe and beyond,\u201d Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in the statement.\nThe agreement will allow CISPE members to use enhanced Microsoft Azure features, with service providers permitted to offer Microsoft applications and services on their local cloud infrastructures, the association said in a statement.\nA European Commission spokesperson said it would assess the impact of the settlement on competition in European cloud markets.\nThe deal however was not offered to CISPE\u2019s largest member, Amazon Web Services or to Google\u2019s Cloud Platform and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd\u2019s cloud service, CISPE said.\nAWS said in a statement that the settlement \u201cdoes nothing for the vast majority of Microsoft customers who are still unable to use the cloud of their choice in Europe and around the world.\u201d\nThe agreement between Microsoft and CISPE puts an end to a long-running back-and-forth between the parties, that saw Microsoft make a spate of concessions in order to appease the concerns of cloud service providers. On the heels of those complaints, EU regulators had been informally asking market rivals and customers about Microsoft\u2019s conduct.\n\u201cWe are exploring our options to continue to fight against Microsoft\u2019s anti-competitive licensing in order to promote choice, innovation, and the growth of the digital economy in Europe,\u201d Amit Zavery, head of platform at Google Cloud, said.\nMicrosoft is no stranger to EU antitrust scrutiny and in previous decades fought a long battle with regulators over abuses linked to the market dominance of Windows.\nMore recently, its $13 billion investment into OpenAI Inc. is the focus of an informal investigation by regulators, after concerns emerged about the AI firm\u2019s exclusive use of Microsoft\u2019s cloud technology. In June, the EU also accused the company of abusing its market power by bundling the Teams video-conferencing app to its other business software.\n(Updates with European Commission comment in fifth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla\nLooser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom\nUkraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs\nAsia Is The New Hot Destination for Luxury Travel\nFrench Elections Result Is Least Worst Outcome for Business\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "A Microsoft subsidiary is the target of the latest privacy complaint from the European nonprofit Noyb, which has successfully battled a number of other companies in recent years. And the accusations in this case are quite something.\nThe issues lie with a Microsoft-owned ad-tech outfit called Xandr, which offers a real-time bidding platform for online ad placements\u2014meaning it processes a ton of personal data to infer what people are likely to click on. (Note: In Europe, \u201cpersonal data\u201d means any data that can be connected with an identifiable person.) Much of Xandr\u2019s data is highly sensitive, covering things like religious beliefs, sexuality, health, and financial status.\nNoyb, complaining in Italy on behalf of an unnamed Italian, says Xandr violates the EU's General Data Protection Regulation by failing to let people access the data it holds on them or to erase the data. It also claims that Xandr breaks the law by doing what it does quite badly.\nThe way Noyb tells it, much of the data Xandr uses for targeting is inaccurate and contradictory. The complainant couldn\u2019t get their data from Xandr, but they had better luck with Xandr supplier Emetriq, a data broker that tracks people online and then sells the resulting information. Emetriq\u2019s data suggested the complainant was both a man and a woman, fell into every age segment between 16 and 60+, was both a light and heavy TV viewer, was both employed and a job seeker\u2026you get the picture.\n\u201cIt seems that parts of the advertising industry don\u2019t really care about providing advertisers with accurate information,\u201d said Noyb lawyer Massimiliano Gelmi, adding that \u201cthis can potentially benefit companies like Xandr as they can sell the same user as young and old to different business partners.\u201d\nNeither Microsoft nor Emetriq had responded to requests for comment by the time of publication.\nNoyb says it wants the Italian data protection authority to make Xandr comply with the parts of the GDPR that ban holding excessive data about individuals, and that any data held must be accurate. It also wants Xandr to get \u201can effective, proportionate and dissuasive\u201d GDPR fine of up to 4% of global revenue\u2014and it wants the operation to finally let people access and delete the data it keeps on them.\nThat could be a problem as\u2014according to the complaint\u2014Xandr tells people its ad platform \u201conly contains consumers\u2019 pseudonymous personal data and not personally identifiable information,\u201d making it impossible to find and turn over information about a specific person.\nNoyb claims Xandr can do this, as its cookies assign unique identifiers to people. The complaint casts doubt on Xandr\u2019s claims about only holding pseudonymized data\u2014which can still be linked to people when correlated with other information, unlike anonymized data, which can never be re-linked. It also says that, even if the data is pseudonymized, the people it\u2019s about still have the right to access it or demand that it be deleted.\nApart from reflecting badly on how usefully Microsoft\u2019s real-time bidding platform serves advertisers, this case feels like another Jenga block being slid out from underneath the online ad industry in Europe.\nLast year, the EU\u2019s highest court blew up the legal foundations of Meta\u2019s targeted ad business in a ruling the company is still struggling to deal with (it may soon have to actually ask for people\u2019s consent before tracking them). And earlier this year, the court ruled in a case about consent popups that a pseudonymized string of letters and numbers, containing information about someone\u2019s preferences, can still be considered personal data if it can be linked with the user\u2019s device\u2014meaning the user still gets to demand access and deletion, even if the company says it has no way of doing this.\nMore news below.\nDavid Meyer\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Eric Volkman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Inaction rather than action was a key cause of tech incumbent Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) stock dip on Wednesday. A media report stating that the company is apparently unwilling to modify its relationship with a troubled business partner dampened investor sentiment. Ultimately, the shares closed the day nearly 4% lower, a worse performance than the 2.3% dip of the S&P 500 index.\nIn a brief article published that morning and citing an unidentified \"person familiar with the issue,\" Reuters said that there is no indication the company plans to limit CrowdStrike's (NASDAQ: CRWD) access to Microsoft's Windows operating system.\nThe news agency did not elaborate, and Microsoft has not yet commented on the story.\nLast Friday, CrowdStrike updated its cloud-based software offerings. This didn't exactly go smoothly; a defect found its way into the update, and it crashed millions of Microsoft Windows devices throughout the world. Many of these devices were operated by businesses dependent on them, and the resulting shutdowns were extremely disruptive in numerous instances.\nCrowdStrike isn't doing a good job of handling the fallout from the crisis and reassuring clients, and Microsoft isn't pursuing a much smarter strategy. It seems determined to maintain silence on the issue, likely in a play at keeping CrowdStrike sweet (the cybersecurity company is still an important business partner, at least as of this writing).\nNeither is a particularly wise approach since many of those customers suffered real reputational and even financial damage from the incident. Microsoft wasn't directly responsible, of course, but it wouldn't hurt the company to be more communicative and contrite about the matter.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\nTo the extent that worries about pricey tech stocks and rising AI capex spending were partly behind last week's market shakeout, Microsoft's quarterly update should prove a key moment later on Tuesday, just as the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting gets under way.\nMarkets run the gauntlet of three major central bank decisions this week, the July U.S. employment report on Friday and four U.S. megacap earnings reports.\nWith U.S. election uncertainty as the backdrop, trepidation ahead of the week's events understandably held most major macro prices in check. U.S. stock futures were marginally higher ahead of Tuesday's bell, while Treasury yields and the dollar nudged up too.\nCaution ahead of the Fed's policy decision on Wednesday - which is preceded by a possible tightening jolt from the Bank of Japan earlier that day - may muffle the initial reaction to Microsoft's report.\nBut a key question for investors will be whether growth in Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing business has picked up enough to justify the billions of dollars being spent on artificial intelligence infrastructure. Its stock was down a touch, out of hours on Tuesday.\nMeta follows with its earnings release on Wednesday and Apple and Amazon report the day after.\nFor the next 36 hours or so, however, it will be hard to disentangle the issues surrounding the so-called Magnificent Seven megacaps from the Fed meeting - where signals on a first interest rate cut as soon as September are expected.\nWith disinflation resuming, Fed attention is shifting to the other side of its twin mandate and what appears to be a significant cooling of the labor market.\nFriday's national payrolls report for July comes too late to influence Fed thinking this week. But policymakers will today get a glimpse of just how much the jobs market was loosening last month with the latest JOLTS job openings numbers.\nTreasury markets remained calm - helped by Fed easing hopes, a cut in government borrowing estimates for the coming quarter and falling crude oil prices.\nThe U.S. Treasury said on Monday it expects to borrow $740 billion in the third quarter, $106 billion lower than the April estimate and mainly due to lower redemptions in the Federal Reserve System Open Market Account and a higher cash balance at the beginning of the quarter.\nThe government will offer more details on the refunding schedule on Wednesday morning.\nEven though the election fogs the windscreen before then, analysts are already crunching the Treasury numbers to see what it may mean for the debt ceiling, which is due to be reinstated on Jan. 2 unless Congress suspends it again. As it stands, the estimated cash balance for December makes it likely government could last until July or August before running out of cash.\nWith OPEC+ oil ministers due to meet again on Thursday and political tensions in OPEC member Venezuela rising after a disputed weekend election result there, crude oil prices ebbed to their lowest in six weeks and clocked their deepest year-on-year loss since Feb. 1 - almost 5%.\nElsewhere, the yen weakened into the BOJ meeting and sterling was steady ahead of the Bank of England's likely tight decision on a first UK rate cut on Thursday.\nThe euro rose on mixed bag of economic numbers. Even though Germany recorded an unexpected contraction of its economy in the second quarter, and some German states exceeded inflation expectations for July, the euro zone economy as a whole actually beat forecasts as GDP in the bloc climbed 0.3% in Q2.\nAnd it was a heavy earnings diary in Europe too.\nStandard Chartered jumped almost 6% after the UK-based bank announced a $1.5 billion share buyback, its biggest ever, and lifted its income outlook for 2024.\nUK asset manager St James's Place soared more than 20% after outlining a six-year plan to slash costs and revamp its services, putting its stock on course for their biggest one-day rise since 2008.\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday: * US June JOLTS job openings report, July consumer confidence, Dallas Fed July service sector survey, May house prices\n* Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee starts two-day policy meeting, decision Wednesday; Bank of Japan also holds Monetary Policy Meeting, decision Wednesday\n* US corporate earnings: Microsoft, Advanced Micro Devices, Pfizer, Merck, Corning, Proctor & Gamble, Starbucks, Caesars Entertainment, Arista Networks, Archer-Daniels-Midland, Sysco, Stryker, Skyworks Solutions, S&P Global, Stanley Black & Decker, American Tower, Illinois Took Works, Mondelez, Essex Property, First Solar, FirstEnergy, Howmet, Xylem, Incyte, Zebra, Match, Live Nation, Ecolab, Gartner etc\n(By Mike Dolan; Editing by Kevin Liffey; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)\n"

        "Text": "Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) is often considered a reference stock for the technology sector, being one of the two largest stocks by market cap along with Nvidia (NVDA) (they have been swapping places over the last few weeks). Despite exceeding a whopping $3 trillion market capitalization and sitting at the top of the market, the company has exciting days ahead with double-digit growth thanks to the quality of its cloud business and its ability to incorporate artificial intelligence in all major business units and customer solutions.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nList of 52-Week Lows\nList of 3-Year Lows\nList of 5-Year Lows\nStock analysts often highlight the products of Microsoft when referring to its growth. The company's growth potential is, however, rooted in its organization and not in specific products like Azure or Copilot.\nMicrosoft is a very large corporation with a complex structure. If I had to compare it to an animal, it would be the octopus as the company has three primary arms that have a number of subdivisions under each, which support the overall company. The main divisions are Intelligent Cloud (including the high-growth Azure unit), Personal Computing (including Windows and Gaming, which holds the recently acquired Activision Blizzard subsidiary) and Productivity & Business Processes, which encompasses all the corporate solutions (Teams, Skype, Outlook, etc.).\nSource: Lexchart\nMicrosoft's current growth catalyst is Intelligent Cloud, in particular its cloud solution Azure. The company managed to implement AI technology into the software to create rapid and custom-built solutions for its customers. According to the earnings report released on April 25, the Intelligent Cloud has been the fastest-growing business unit with 21% year-over-year revenue growth, second only to Xbox's 62% growth, of which 61% is a net impact of the Activision acquisition.\nWithin the Intelligent Cloud segment, server products and cloud services (which includes Azure) grew 24%. This growth rate is well above Amazon Web Services' 17% growth, showing the software is catching up. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS is still in first place with 31% market share, but Azure is trailing close behind with 24% market share.\nSource: Mordor Intelligence\nThe company is likely to continue outperforming its competitors, particularly AWS, given it is a few steps ahead in terms of AI relative to Amazon. Being the main investor in OpenAI (Microsoft invested around $13 billion) helped and will continue to help it stay ahead of competition in terms of AI, with perhaps the only serious threat being Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Despite the competition, the space is large enough for all these companies to continue on a path of growth. Indeed, the cloud computing market is expected to grow at a 16.40% compounded annual rate in the next five years. Therefore, given Azure's AI capabilities and backing by other business units of Microsoft, it is not unreasonable to assume continued growth above 20%.\nMicrosoft's financials are solid and enviable. Its balance sheet is pristine. Despite the $68.70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard to boost its stagnant Gaming & Personal Computing segment, the company still has $80 billion in cash on hand, which is sufficient for another large acquisition. Its total debt amounts to $106 billion and with $70 billion of expected free cash flow it would generate in 2024, the company could easily repay all of its debt in a hypothetical scenario.\nFurther, free cash flow continues to trend higher year after year. Free cash flow is an indicator that is appreciated by investors as it shows the ability of a company to efficiently manage its business. Rising free cash flow is also an excellent indicator for the coming years; the cash generated by the company can support acquisitions and investments into the business that will in turn trigger new growth catalysts (i.e., investment in OpenAI, acquisition of Activision).\nFree cash flow is also a reassurance for shareholders as an uptrend also increases the likelihood of cash returned to investors in the form of share buybacks. Microsoft already returned $8.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends in the last quarter, according to its latest earnings report. The dividend yield is rather low (0.67%) - in part due to fast-paced stock price growth - but the dividend payments have been rising consecutively for 19 years.\nRevenue has been growing at an average rate of 14% over the last five years. Its return on capital averaged 30% per year and its earnings margin averaged 40% in the same period, which altogether further confirm the business is efficiently managed and the cash it generates continues to support and fuel its growth.\nAt first glance, the stock may appear slightly overvalued. It is trading at 23 times last 12 months earnings and 27 times forward earnings, which puts it on the higher range of its historical valuation. However, it is important to note Microsoft's valuation has been on the rise since the Global Financial Crisis, with earnings multiples expanding. This is typical of companies that show sustained high growth, and it is likely that the multiples will continue expanding in the coming years.\nFrom a pure multiple perspective, the stock may indeed not be undervalued, as shown by the GF Value chart above.\nBut when computing the valuation via a discounted cash flow model, we can see the stock may actually be undervalued by approximately 20% to 25%. For the calculation, I used the actual total earnings per share in the last 12 months and a (very) conservative 7.50% growth rate for earnings per share. This gave me a stock value of $496 per share. Interestingly, this is in line with Citi analyst Tyler Radke's initial price target ($495) before he hiked it to $520, citing recent media reports in relation to OpenAI's doubled annualized revenue and Microsoft's cloud deal with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).\nIn the technology sector, the main threat is always obsolescence, which is rooted in lack of innovation and results in the competition overtaking it. Especially for large and successful companies, staying at the top for decades is particularly hard. This requires consistency in the management team. There is one large exception here, however: the company's octopus-like structure and continued investments in distinct business units. These numerous tentacles of innovation and growth allow Microsoft to remain one of the top-performing companies and to minimize any adverse impacts when one or even multiple business units are struggling.\nDespite having reached an impressive market cap, Microsoft still has wonderful years ahead of double-digit growth. Artificial intelligence is yet another tailwind that is already boosting its cloud business and putting the company as one of the likely AI leaders.\nIts direct exposure to OpenAI additionally increases the likelihood of Microsoft staying ahead of the competition in the sphere of generative AI. Its structure ensures innovation and finds new growth catalysts in a rapidly changing technological landscape. The stock is attractively valued and represents a buying opportunity for long-term tech-focused or diversified investment portfolios.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "Chinese cybersecurity companies are taking advantage of the massive Microsoft Windows outage that upended businesses and grounded flights around the world on Thursday and Friday by promoting their own software, as Beijing pushes to cut the country's reliance on foreign suppliers.\nAustin, Texas-based cybersecurity company CrowdStrike caused the outage, one of the largest in history, by pushing a bad software update that crashed the Windows operating system. It affected airports, banks, and hospitals, among many other businesses.\n360 Security Technology, China's largest cybersecurity firm, took the opportunity to promote its products, which it claimed were \"more reliable, stable, comprehensive and intelligent\".\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Photo: Xinhua>\nQAX, another well-known firm in the sector, wrote in a blog post on Friday that \"software vendors involved in system stability need to have stricter quality control of their software\".\nTencent Holdings, which operates the Tencent PC Manager platform, said on Friday that it received reports from some users who experienced the Windows error screen, known as the blue screen of death. It referred users to CrowdStrike's official workaround steps to resolve the problem.\nThe incident adds to Beijing's list of reasons for seeking to move away from foreign technology as it pursues technological self-reliance in the face of mounting export restrictions and sanctions from Washington. Key infrastructure was largely unaffected in China, where only foreign businesses and luxury hotels were hit.\nWhile Microsoft said on Friday that its systems had been restored, many businesses continued to deal with the fallout.\nThe Hong Kong International Airport, whose passenger check-in system collapsed, issued a notice on Saturday saying operations had returned to normal.\nChina's cybersecurity market is dominated by local players. Beijing has long been phasing out software from companies like Russia's Kaspersky Lab and US-based Symantec. CrowdStrike does not sell products and services in China, according to its website.\nCrowdStrike shares fell 11.1 per cent to US$304.96 on the Nasdaq on Friday, while Microsoft edged down 0.74 per cent. Competitors SentinelOne and Palo Alto Networks gained 7.85 per cent and 2.16 per cent, respectively.\nWhile China has pursued technological self-reliance to varying degrees for decades, the government's mistrust of foreign commercial software deepened after the 2013 leaks from US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden revealed methods that the National Security Agency used to access information from some of the world's biggest tech companies.\nThe government made a concerted push to completely switch to domestic security software a decade ago, according to a 2014 report by state-owned China News Service.\nAll the departments of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology have installed 360 software, the report said, and state-owned enterprises would follow by also installing domestic alternatives.\nCrowdStrike has made monitoring for Chinese cyberattacks an important part of its business, as Western countries have warned of an increasing number of attacks coming from China-linked actors.\nIn 2015, the company reported seven Chinese cyberattacks against US technology and pharmaceutical companies. China's foreign affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at the time that \"the Chinese government would not in any way participate, encourage or support enterprises in engaging in the theft of trade secrets\".\nIn its latest annual report, CrowdStrike said that \"China-nexus adversaries increasingly targeted third-party relationships\" in 2023.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Text": "The eyes of a great many investors were on Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) after the market closed on Tuesday. That's when the tech giant published its latest set of quarterly results. While these certainly weren't bad, certain fundamentals were concerning enough to inspire a bit of a sell-off in the company's stock the following day. Microsoft's share price slipped by a bit over 1% on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 index notched a 1.6% gain.\nMicrosoft divulged that it earned $64.7 billion in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, for a 15% year-over-year increase. Net income, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) standards, was just over $22 billion, or $2.95 per share, representing a nearly 10% improvement over the year-ago profit.\nGrowth in headline figures is always welcomed by investors. However, Microsoft only marginally beat the average analyst estimates. Collectively, prognosticators tracking the stock were modeling just under $64.4 billion for revenue and $2.94 in per-share net income.\nOf its three business segments, Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud unit was the largest in terms of revenue for the quarter. It also boasted the most growth, rising 19% year over year to bring in more than $28.5 billion. Productivity and Business Processes rose by 11% to $20.3 billion. Finally, More Personal Computing increased by 14% to almost $15.9 billion.\nOne sore spot among those figures was Microsoft's take for its Azure cloud service -- a key driver of revenue growth lately for the company. Azure's year-over-year growth was 29%. However, the consensus analyst estimate was for slightly over 30%.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Microsoft's robust cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities position it as a leader in digital transformation.\nContinuous innovation in productivity and business processes drives growth and customer engagement.\nStrategic investments in gaming and personal computing segments expand market reach.\nGlobal economic conditions and competitive forces present both challenges and opportunities for Microsoft.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nOn July 30, 2024, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) filed its 10-K report, revealing a comprehensive overview of its operational and financial performance. Known for its Windows operating systems and Office productivity suite, Microsoft has diversified its offerings across productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and personal computing. The financial tables from the filing indicate a company with a solid balance sheet and a strong position in the market, driven by significant revenue growth in its cloud services and a steady increase in Microsoft 365 subscribers.\nRobust Cloud Infrastructure and AI Capabilities: Microsoft's cloud business, spearheaded by Azure, is a testament to its strength in the market. The company's ability to provide hybrid consistency, developer productivity, data and AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance sets it apart from competitors. With economies of scale in datacenters and multi-tenancy locations, Microsoft offers computational resources at a lower cost per unit, enhancing its competitive edge. The introduction of custom AI accelerators like Azure Maia and partnerships with chip manufacturers further solidify Microsoft's position as a leader in AI at scale.\nInnovation in Productivity and Business Processes: Microsoft's continuous innovation, particularly in its productivity and business processes segment, is a key strength. The integration of AI with Microsoft 365, including the development of Copilot for Microsoft 365 and role-based extensions like Copilot for Sales, Service, and Finance, demonstrates the company's commitment to advancing productivity tools. These innovations not only improve user experience but also streamline business processes, contributing to Microsoft's growth and customer retention.\nDependency on Third-Party Manufacturers: Microsoft's reliance on third-party contract manufacturers for device production introduces potential risks. The limited number of qualified suppliers for certain components could lead to disruptions in manufacturing, affecting the company's ability to meet consumer demand on time. This weakness underscores the importance of diversifying the supply chain and mitigating risks associated with supplier concentration.\nIntense Competition in Personal Computing and Gaming: The More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows, Devices, and Gaming, faces fierce competition from companies like Apple, Google, and various gaming platforms. While Microsoft has made strategic investments in this area, the rapidly evolving preferences for devices and form factors, along with the challenge of differentiating in a crowded market, remain significant weaknesses that require ongoing innovation and marketing strategies to overcome.\nExpansion of Digital Transformation Services: The global shift towards digital transformation presents a significant opportunity for Microsoft. By leveraging its strong cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities, the company can cater to the growing demand for digital services across various sectors. Microsoft's investments in sustainable computing and the expansion of its datacenter footprint to support AI services align with this opportunity, potentially leading to increased market share and revenue growth.\nGrowth in Gaming and Entertainment: The gaming industry's expansion offers Microsoft the chance to capitalize on its Xbox ecosystem and cloud gaming services. With the acquisition of gaming studios and content, Microsoft can enhance its Xbox Game Pass offerings and attract a broader user base. The focus on creating unique gaming experiences and diversifying across subscriptions, ads, and digital stores positions Microsoft to tap into new revenue streams within the gaming sector.\nGlobal Economic and Geopolitical Factors: Microsoft's performance is influenced by global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which can be unpredictable. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and changes in global demand for software, services, and devices due to economic conditions pose threats to Microsoft's revenue and profitability. The company must navigate these challenges by adapting its strategies to mitigate the impact of economic downturns and geopolitical tensions.\nRapid Technological Changes and Innovation by Competitors: The technology industry is characterized by rapid changes and innovation. Microsoft faces the threat of competitors developing new software and devices, as well as deploying competing cloud-based services. To maintain its competitive edge, Microsoft must continue to invest in research and development, embrace disruptive technology trends, and quickly adapt to changes in customer preferences and technology advancements.\nIn conclusion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) exhibits a strong foundation with its robust cloud infrastructure, AI capabilities, and continuous innovation in productivity tools. However, it must address weaknesses such as dependency on third-party manufacturers and intense competition in personal computing and gaming. Opportunities for growth lie in the expansion of digital transformation services and the gaming industry. Microsoft must remain vigilant of threats from global economic conditions and rapid technological changes. By leveraging its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats, Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the technology sector.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Jeff Butts ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nFollowing criticism from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) of Microsoft\u2019s planned price and feature changes to its Game Pass subscription service, the software giant has responded to allegations of product degradation. In a letter to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court, Microsoft argues that its new least expensive Game Pass tier is a better product for gamers, not a degraded one, because it includes multiplayer functionality.\nOn Thursday, the FTC submitted a letter to the Ninth Circuit Court accusing Microsoft of product degradation following its Activision-Blizzard acquisition. At issue was Microsoft\u2019s removal of day-one new release access to subscribers, something gamers had under the less expensive console-only Game Pass base tier. Under the new Game Pass Standard tier, $4 per month more expensive than the previous entry-level plan, gamers get multiplayer functionality but lose out on included access to new games.\nThe FTC alleged that constituted \u201cthe hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger,\u201d something the FTC claims it was worried about from the beginning of the merger talks. For its part, Microsoft doesn\u2019t agree. The company pointed out in its own letter to the Circuit Court that under previous pricing, what its new Game Pass Standard offers was actually more expensive.\n\"It is wrong to call this a 'degraded' version of the discontinued Game Pass for Console offering,\u201d Microsoft wrote. \u201cThat discontinued product did not offer multiplayer functionality, which had to be purchased separately for an additional $9.99/month (making the total cost $20.98/month).\"\nMicrosoft also pointed out that Game Pass Ultimate would offer more value to subscribers than it previously did. With the merger, Game Pass Ultimate will now offer day-one availability to new Activision-Blizzard games like the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Before the merger, gamers weren\u2019t afforded that benefit at all; if they wanted to play Call of Duty games the day they were released, they had to buy them.\nMicrosoft also pointed out that the FTC didn\u2019t seem too concerned about its Game Pass subscription offering when it was trying to block the merger. Instead, FTC arguments centered on \u201cthe theory that Microsoft would withhold Call of Duty from Sony's console.\u201d That fear turned out to be unfounded, as Microsoft and Sony entered into a 10-year contract to keep Call of Duty titles on PlayStation.\nThe FTC is appealing the decision that allowed Microsoft to purchase Activision-Blizzard, and the dialog of letters is another episode in that ongoing saga. Whether the Ninth Circuit Court will reverse the merger remains to be seen.\n"

        "Author": "  Alexei Oreskovic ",
        "Text": "The three giants of the AI valley have spoken. What have we learned?\nNot much\u2014other than the fact that all three (Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta) see no limit to the amount of wealth they\u2019re itching to pump into their AI projects.\nOver the course of three hour-long earnings calls, the only hard numbers about AI that we heard this week related to capital expenditures. The Big Tech trio spent a combined $40.5 billion on the infrastructure, land, and chips that power their AI services during the second quarter. And each company indicated that those numbers will only get bigger next year.\nThe rest of the AI info that was served up\u2014particularly anything related to the revenue side of the ledger\u2014amounted to mostly empty rhetoric.\nLet\u2019s start with Meta. On Wednesday CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was on track to have \u201cthe world\u2019s most used AI assistant by the end of the year.\u201d\nZuck didn\u2019t provide much context to help listeners understand what this feat might mean. Is an AI assistant in the same category as a \u201ccopilot,\u201d the generative AI tool that rival Microsoft is fervently pushing to its customers? Unclear.\nLet\u2019s assume an \u201cAI assistant\u201d is a traditional chatbot, in the same class as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and Google\u2019s Gemini. How does Meta AI stack up? Search around, and you\u2019ll discover that even trying to make an apples-to-oranges comparison is not easy. Google said in May that \u201cover 1 million people have signed up to try Gemini Advanced in just three months,\u201d and on its earnings call last week CEO Sundar Pichai said that Gemini is now used in \u201call six of our products with more than 2 billion monthly users\u201d\u2014nice large numbers that don\u2019t really tell us anything. For its part, OpenAI said in May that \u201cevery week, more than a hundred million people use ChatGPT.\u201d\nAll of this suggests that Meta, which now has 3.3 billion daily users across its family of apps, could theoretically declare victory if at year\u2019s end there are 101 million people per week using the AI assistant that it has very conspicuously bolted on to Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. The bar doesn\u2019t appear to be very high.\nAs for when these Meta AI users will lift the company\u2019s top line, Zuckerberg takes a long-term view: Generative AI will not be a meaningful driver of the business for \u201cyears.\u201d Don\u2019t expect generative AI to move the needle next year, or even in 2026, Zuckerberg said\u2014AI revenue in 2025 and 2026 will come from the traditional, behind-the-scenes AI tools that the company uses to improve feed recommendations and advertising, but not from Meta AI.\nSatya Nadella had lots of impressive sounding but similarly hazy data points to share on the Microsoft earnings call, and he unleashed them in a rapid-fire barrage. Azure AI customers increased by more than 60% year over year, with roughly 60,000 customers in total. Microsoft 365 customers increased 60% from the previous quarter, with the majority of enterprise customers \u201ccoming back to purchase more seats.\u201d And the number of customers with more than 10,000 Microsoft seats more than doubled quarter over quarter, we learned, but it was left unspecified if those are all paid seats. (Microsoft confirmed after publication that they were paid seats).\nThe closest Nadella came to dropping a hard number involved GitHub, and the AI \u201ccopilot\u201d that helps computer programmers write code.\nGitHub\u2019s annual revenue \u201crun rate\u201d is now $2 billion, Nadella said. Run rates are a slippery thing, of course\u2014what is the $2 billion run rate extrapolated from: revenue rung up in the most recent quarter? Month? Day? Hour? Nadella didn\u2019t say. But he noted that copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub\u2019s revenue growth this year (note that this revenue growth is not the same thing as the just-mentioned revenue run rate, so that $2 billion number is not relevant). He then said that GitHub copilot is already a larger business than the entirety of GitHub when Microsoft acquired the company back in 2018.\nThere\u2019s no public number for GitHub\u2019s revenue at the time of its acquisition, since it was a private company. But a New York Times article at the time cites analyst estimates that GitHub\u2019s revenue was \u201crunning at $200 million a year.\u201d\nSo there you have it, one somewhat solid data point about AI from the Big Tech earnings reports: GitHub copilot\u2019s revenue is somewhere just north of $200 million a year, and very likely below $400 million (since Nadella would presumably have described the business as \u201cmore than twice the size\u201d if that were the case, right?).\nWall Street analyst notes recapping the earnings are full of commentary about \u201cstrong demand signals\u201d and promising AI uptake. And Meta\u2019s stock is riding high today, following Wednesday\u2019s earnings report, thanks to the enduring strength of its advertising business. But when you look closely at what we actually learned about generative AI, there\u2019s not much there there.\nCorrection: The number of Microsoft 365 copilot customers increased 60% in Q2, rather than doubled. And the number of customers with at least 10,000 enterprise seats more than doubled, as opposed to the total number of enterprise seats being 10,000.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

Under the agreement, Microsoft President Brad Smith will join the UAE firm\u2019s board and G42 will use Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud for its AI applications. The deal was supported by the Biden administration, which is determined to bolster US AI leadership around the world \u2014 and see G42 decouple from Chinese companies including Huawei Technologies Co.\nBut the arrangement quickly attracted scrutiny in Washington, where some officials had already grown wary of G42 over its alleged ties to blacklisted Chinese companies. The concerns range from the possibility of China accessing sensitive American technology to the risks of shipping AI to Gulf states with questionable human-rights records.\nOne key question is whether the US will approve shipments of cutting-edge Nvidia Corp. H100 chips for data centers in the Middle East. Officials have been slow-walking those licenses over the past several months, Bloomberg has reported, as they hash out an AI national security strategy for the Gulf.\nMcCaul and Moolenaar said in their letter that they\u2019ve had \u201cnumerous productive conversations\u201d with Microsoft about their worries. But they want to see \u201csignificantly more robust\u201d national security guardrails before the US transfers any sensitive technology \u2014 including hardware, services and research. They also called for a more formal framework around the export of chips and AI model weights.\nIn addition to the risks of hardware shipments, some Pentagon officials are also skeptical that G42 will fully decouple from China, a key promise that paved the way for the Microsoft partnership. A new Abu Dhabi investment vehicle called Lunate is taking over management of what was G42\u2019s 42XFund, an entity with stakes in units of Chinese tech giants such as ByteDance Ltd.

In an unusual arrangement for the industry to help address concerns about the merger made back in 2022, Microsoft pledged to stay neutral if Activision Blizzard workers in the U.S. and Canada seek to organize into a labor union.\nWith Wednesday's World of Warcraft news, alongside other recent organizing efforts, CWA says more than 1,750 video game workers at Microsoft now have representation with the union.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve accomplished at World of Warcraft is just the beginning,\" Eric Lanham, a World of Warcraft test analyst and member of the newly-formed guild said in a statement \u2014 noting that the next step is a strong contract. \u201cWe know that when workers have a protected voice, it\u2019s a win-win for employee standards, the studio, and World of Warcraft fans looking for the best gaming experience.\u201d\nTom Smith, senior director of organizing at CWA, added that Wednesday's news \u201cmarks a key inflection point\" in the broader industrywide efforts to organize video game workers.\nAlso on Wenesday, CWA announced that a group of 60 quality assurance workers at Blizzard Entertainment in Austin, Texas, also joined the union and were recognized by Microsoft. These quality assurance workers \u2014 who work on franchisees like Diablo and Hearthstone \u2014 and World of Warcraft's development employees both had their unions confirmed by a neutral arbitrator after a majority signed authorization cards or cast support through an online portal, CWA said.\nIn a statement to The Associated Press Thursday, a spokesperson for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said the company continues \u201cto support our employees\u2019 right to choose how they are represented in the workplace\u201d and will negotiate with the CWA in good faith to work towards a collective bargaining agreement.\nThe World of Warcraft workers' union representation marks a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d in a journey that dates back to a 2021 employee walkout at Activision Blizzard's headquarters, CWA noted Wednesday.

        "Text": "Microsoft tore the wrapping paper from its latest contact center offer with the general availability of \u2018Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Center\u2019 on July 1, 2024.\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 Contact Center is a contact center-as-a-service (CCaaS) offer that works across channels including voice, SMS, chat, email, and social media apps. It incorporates Microsoft Copilot, a proprietary generative AI (GenAI) and natural language processing engine to provide personalised self-service as well as automate repetitive agent tasks such as summarising conversations, drafting emails, and offering suggested responses.\nIntelligent routing can transfer self-service requests to an agent best qualified to assist. GenAI-based, real-time reporting allows supervisors to assess center operations. Users can also connect to customer resource managements (CRMs) and custom apps they already use.\nWhen it comes to Microsoft, contact center is the gift that keeps on giving. Pre-dating this new arrival is a string of ancestors born annually, featuring overlapping functionality and sometimes bearing similar names. Sorting through the morass is confusing.\nIt is not clear whether Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Center is a unique persona or merely a twin. The name reads like a cross between \u2018Microsoft Digital Contact Center Platform\u2019 released in July 2022 and \u2018Copilot in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service\u2019 released in March 2023. Also, functionality bears a striking resemblance across the three offers. For example: the option of self-service capability or connection to a virtual or live agent; support for numerous customer engagement channels; suggested responses to customer inquiries; automation of multiple agent tasks; and extensive use of GenAI.\nThe confusion does not terminate there: Microsoft also just introduced \u2018Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service Premium,\u2019 which takes Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Center and layers on top another service - the similar sounding \u2018Dynamics 365 Customer Service Enterprise.\u2019 The combined offer is an integrated contact center and CRM service solution that creates personalised customer journeys. However, the value of the offer gets lost in the shuffle of confusing naming conventions.\nA sequence of contact center offers that are difficult to parse is only one Achilles\u2019 heel that Microsoft needs to resolve. Competitors such as Cisco, Zoom, and RingCentral bring contact center offers to the market as well, and they are continually enriching them with new features and capabilities. In addition, they don\u2019t suffer puzzling nomenclature, nor do they come with historical baggage attached: Customers avoid the struggle of attempting to decipher the portfolio.\nMicrosoft could alleviate some of the competitive pressure by mimicking those same rivals and coupling Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Center with Microsoft Teams to fill the growing need for integrated unified communications-as-a-service (UCaaS) and CCaaS that allows all customer facing employees to better serve customers.\nIt is surprising that Microsoft has not taken that logical step. If it does and plants a firm stake in the ground with an unwavering, definitive, flagship contact center offer, it would make for a nice springboard for future success in the contact center space.\n\"Microsoft contact center portfolio is puzzling\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Alexandra Alper and Christopher Bing ",
        "Text": "By Alexandra Alper and Christopher Bing\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republican lawmakers asked the Biden administration for an intelligence assessment of Microsoft's $1.5 billion investment in UAE-based artificial intelligence firm G42 over concerns about transfer of sensitive technology and G42's historic ties to China.\nRepresentative Michael McCaul, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and John Moolenaar, leader of the Select Committee on China, made the request for a briefing in a letter dated Wednesday to White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, the committees said.\nThe Republicans said they want the briefing on the deal, announced in April, before it advances to a second phase involving the transfer of export-restricted semiconductor chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.\nThe letter is a sign of growing concern about the lack of regulations around the export of sensitive AI models, as fears mount that companies like G42 might share the prized technology with U.S. adversaries like China.\n\"We remain deeply concerned by attempts to move quickly to advance a partnership that involves the unprecedented transfer of highly sensitive, U.S.-origin technology, without congressional consultation or clearly defined regulations in place,\" the lawmakers said in the letter.\nThey asked for a U.S. assessment of G42's ties to China's Communist Party, military and government before the Microsoft deal advances. They cited a recent visit by UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to Beijing to discuss, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua, cooperation in AI.\nMicrosoft said in a statement it was working closely with the U.S. government and \"U.S. national security will continue to be a principal priority.\" The White House National Security Council spokesperson said in a statement that the administration has been in regular dialogue with lawmakers to ensure they are aware of the risks associated with digital infrastructure. \"National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan looks forward to continuing this engagement, including with Chair McCaul,\" the person added.\nSpokespeople for G42 and the United Arab Emirates embassy did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe Chinese Embassy said, \"The U.S. has repeatedly undermined cooperation between Chinese companies and other countries on trumped-up security grounds.\"\nCONCERNS ABOUT CHINA\nA House Select Committee aide told reporters on a phone call on Thursday that based on conversations with Microsoft, the lawmakers expect the U.S. company to export otherwise severely restricted AI semiconductor chips to train models as well as AI model weights.\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith told Reuters in May that the deal with G42 could eventually involve the transfer of sophisticated chips and tools.\nThe Republicans' letter also cited G42's past \"digital surveillance\" work as an area of possible risk. The aide highlighted prior connections between G42 staff and Emirati cybersecurity firm DarkMatter, which was the subject of a 2019 Reuters investigation on its cyber espionage activities.\nThe U.S. has had deepening concerns about China's influence in the Middle East and the United Arab Emirates, a longstanding U.S. ally.\nBut G42 said in February it divested its investments in China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with U.S. companies. G42 previously had investments or partnerships in China with TikTok owner ByteDance, vaccine developer Sinopharm and U.S.-blacklisted biotech firm BGO Genomics.\nThe New York Times reported in April that the Microsoft deal with G42 was largely orchestrated by the Biden administration to box out China. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told the paper that the Microsoft deal did not authorize the transfer to G42 of AI models or processors to develop AI applications.\nAlong with Microsoft, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, the country's ruling family and U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake hold stakes in G42, whose chairman, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is the UAE national security adviser and a brother to the president.\nReuters reported in May that the Commerce Department was considering rules to restrict the export of proprietary or closed-source AI. Currently, nothing is stopping U.S. AI giants from selling them to almost anyone in the world without government oversight.\n(Reporting by Alexandra Alper and Christopher Bing; Editing by Lisa Shumaker, David Gregorio and Cynthia Osterman)\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Tech companies from Microsoft Corp. to Qualcomm Inc. are embarking on a marketing blitz for a new type of computer they are dubbing \u201cAI PCs,\u201d promising artificial intelligence features embedded in their laptops and desktops.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSaudis Warned G-7 Over Russia Seizures With Debt Sale Threat\nSaudi Prince\u2019s Trillion-Dollar Makeover Faces Funding Cutbacks\nStock Rotation Hits Megacaps on Bets Fed Will Cut: Markets Wrap\nTesla Delays Robotaxi Event in Blow to Musk\u2019s Autonomy Drive\nModi\u2019s Embrace of Putin Irks Biden Team Pushing Support for Kyiv\nThe new laptops differ from standard devices with the inclusion of an additional processor that\u2019s tailored to speed up AI features like personal assistants and the ability to automate tasks.\nBut only 3% of PCs shipped this year will meet Microsoft\u2019s processing power threshold to be considered an AI PC, according to industry research firm IDC. To persuade consumers and corporations that it\u2019s time to buy, the industry will need to offer a wider variety of the PCs and deliver software that takes advantage of the new hardware.\nSo far, analysts and reviewers also are taking a skeptical tone toward the new laptops\u2019 artificial intelligence abilities. Usefulness is limited because few software makers beyond Microsoft are building features to utilize the new chips in the machines optimized for AI tasks, said Eric Compton, a financial analyst focused on the PC industry at Morningstar.\nApplication makers like Adobe Inc., Salesforce Inc. and SentinelOne Inc. rebuffed one of the largest PC makers when it asked them to tweak software so AI tools could be used directly on the new computers in time for the launch, according to a person familiar with the discussions. All of those companies deliver AI features through the cloud.\nSentinelOne is looking at optimizing its products for AI PCs in future development, but it will likely take years for these devices to reach a \u201csufficient proportion of deployed machines,\u201d Gregor Stewart, the company\u2019s vice president of AI, said in a statement. Clara Shih, who leads Salesforce\u2019s AI efforts, said the company is developing on-device language models, the technology that underpins many types of generative AI, but didn\u2019t provide any expected timeline for release.\nSome smaller software makers optimized their apps for on-device AI. That includes Blackmagic Design Inc., which makes video-editing software that competes with Adobe\u2019s Premiere, and Algoriddim\u2019s music-mixing tool djay.\nFor now, available AI features are largely gimmicks, said a Best Buy Co. employee shortly after launch in June, who asked not to be identified for fear of professional repercussions. Machines known as \u201cCopilot+ PCs\u201d are limited to features like a tool that makes it appear you are looking at the camera during a video meeting when in reality your eyes are focused elsewhere. Generative AI models can be used to produce images on the device, but still require internet connection for content moderation. A flagship Microsoft feature that would let a user easily find past activity on their computer, called Recall, was delayed due to privacy concerns.\nA Microsoft spokesperson said developers have \u201cshown great enthusiasm\u201d in building apps to use the new hardware and user feedback for the new devices has been \u201cterrific.\u201d\nThe stakes are high for many of the companies involved. Qualcomm, the provider of the new chips, says it\u2019s ready to challenge Intel Corp.\u2019s dominance in the machines. PC makers like Dell Technologies Inc. and HP Inc. hope the machines will fuel consumer excitement for personal computers again. But the companies will need to ensure performance matches the marketing to avoid previous dead ends \u2013 like Windows short-lived mobile operating system or detachable screens.\nAn HP spokesperson said the company is working with software vendors to build new experiences for the AI PC while touting existing features like real-time translation.\nEven if features are currently limited, AI PCs have the potential to fuel a wave of new higher-priced purchases. Many consumers, businesses and schools bought laptops in the early months of the pandemic, but haven\u2019t yet upgraded. New AI capabilities will help steer buyers toward higher-end options, Michael Dell, founder and chief executive officer of the namesake company, said in a May interview. \u201cDo you want to buy a PC that is not capable of doing those AI things that you\u2019ll want to do in the future? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\nThere are early signs of traction. A fifth of computers sold during launch week were AI PCs, according to data provided by market researcher Circana. Tech-savvy consumers like content creators have been quicker to adopt the new machines, while the general public is likely still a bit \u201cconfused,\u201d said Mike Crosby, executive director at Circana.\nThe other major selling point is better battery life than other laptops that use Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating systems. Qualcomm claims its more-efficient chips based on Arm Holdings Plc designs can mean days of use without charging. Avi Greengart, an industry analyst at Techsponential who helped host a Qualcomm promotional event, said in an interview that battery life rather than AI is the main selling point of the laptops at this point.\nBut the different chips also raise the potential for compatibility issues with generations of software written for Intel or Advanced Micro Devices Inc. processors. Common apps like Microsoft Office, Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s WhatsApp and Adobe\u2019s Photoshop have been optimized for the Arm-based systems. But many legacy applications still used within businesses will not be supported, likely capping adoption among enterprises, said Erik Woodring, an analyst at Morgan Stanley.\nQualcomm acknowledges it has to step up efforts to promote its brand and help PC makers with advertising. That\u2019s necessary because the industry has relied on Intel for promotional dollars for decades under arguably the most successful component campaign ever: \u201cIntel Inside.\u201d Consumers in particular have been trained to see that label on their computers as a sign of quality. And Intel has even managed to bring sub brands to the forefront. Its Centrino push in 2003 led to an explosion in notebook use with the inclusion of Wi-Fi connections.\nQualcomm, which has tried and failed previously to grab a piece of the PC market, is spending more than $75 million per year to print the name of its Snapdragon processor on the jerseys of Manchester United Football Club players. It has also upped its payments to partners like PC makers to help support marketing, said Chief Marketing Officer Don McGuire.\n\u201cThis is a moment, but this has to be a sustained thing,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the next six years, not the next six months.\u201d\nAverage starting prices for the new slate of Qualcomm-based AI PCs are about 48% more expensive than their non-AI counterparts, wrote Samik Chatterjee, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. He sees Qualcomm owning about 25% of the AI PC market by 2026.\nLater this year, Intel and AMD are expected to release their own AI PCs, which are likely to have fewer of the compatibility issues associated with Arm-based devices.\nStill, it\u2019ll be a long road to get consumer and business adoption. In 2026, AI PCs will still only make up about 20% of new PC shipments, according to IDC.\n--With assistance from Jaewon Kang, Matt Day and Dina Bass.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Rivian Became the Anti-Tesla\nUkraine Is Fighting Russia With Toy Drones and Duct-Taped Bombs\nLooser Visa Rules for Indian Travelers Stoke a Tourism Boom\nAt SpaceX, Elon Musk\u2019s Own Brand of Cancel Culture Is Thriving\nHow Digital Money Really Works\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

This diplomatic engagement has heightened anxieties about potential technology transfers to China, a country with which the U.S. has increasingly strained relations in the tech sector.Microsoft has responded to these concerns, stating that it is working closely with the U.S. government and that \"U.S. national security will continue to be a principal priority.\" The White House National Security Council has also indicated its commitment to ongoing dialogue with lawmakers regarding the risks associated with digital infrastructure.Adding another layer of complexity to the situation, G42's past involvement in \"digital surveillance\" work and alleged connections to Emirati cybersecurity firm DarkMatter have been cited as areas of possible risk. These concerns highlight the intricate web of international relationships and potential security implications surrounding the deal.Interestingly, G42 announced in February that it had divested its investments in China and accepted constraints imposed by the United States to work with U.S. companies. This move, along with reports that the Microsoft-G42 deal was largely orchestrated by the Biden administration to limit China's influence, presents a complex picture of competing interests and strategic maneuvers in the global AI landscape.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs this situation unfolds, it underscores the delicate balance that must be struck between fostering technological innovation, maintaining international partnerships and safeguarding national security interests. The outcome of this congressional inquiry and any subsequent actions could have far-reaching implications for future international AI collaborations and the regulatory framework surrounding AI technology exports.Microsoft continues to face regulatory scrutiny on multiple fronts. The company's $13 billion investment in OpenAI Inc. is under informal investigation by EU regulators due to concerns about the AI firm's exclusive use of MSFT's cloud technology. In response, Microsoft has relinquished its board observer seat at OpenAI to alleviate antitrust concerns in the United States and United Kingdom.Recent legal challenges include a $14.4 million settlement with California's Civil Rights Department over alleged discrimination against employees on parental and disability leave. Additionally, the EU has accused Microsoft of abusing its market power by bundling the Teams video-conferencing app with its business software.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has successfully resolved a potential European Union antitrust investigation into its cloud business practices by reaching an agreement with the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), an Amazon-backed trade association. This settlement comes after Microsoft made several concessions to address concerns raised by cloud service providers, effectively ending a prolonged dispute.

This settlement, pending court approval, marks a significant development in workplace rights and corporate accountability.The lawsuit, which primarily affected women and disabled employees, alleged that Microsoft penalized workers who took protected leave by giving them lower bonuses and unfavorable performance reviews.The California Civil Rights Department's three-year investigation uncovered a workplace culture that reportedly discouraged employees from using protected leave, with managers allegedly making negative comments about such absences.As part of the settlement, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has committed to implementing several measures to prevent future employment abuses.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us.\nIf you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Microsoft, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.29 = US$107b \u00f7 (US$484b - US$119b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nTherefore, Microsoft has an ROCE of 29%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Software industry average of 7.5%.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Microsoft compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Microsoft .\nInvestors would be pleased with what's happening at Microsoft. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 29%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 75%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Microsoft thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\nIn summary, it's great to see that Microsoft can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And a remarkable 249% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.\nLike most companies, Microsoft does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.\nMicrosoft is not the only stock earning high returns.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Edge Computing Market Size and 7 Best Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other edge computing stocks.\nThe information technology sector has consistently outperformed investor and analyst expectations in 2023, and this trend appears to be continuing into the current year. This impressive performance can largely be attributed to significant advancements such as the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI, which have driven tech stock prices to unprecedented highs. Of course, AI is not the only area that is revolutionizing the technology space. Edge Computing comes in as another compelling area of growth and investment. Also known as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) or Multi-Access Edge Computing, Edge Computing focuses on bringing computing power closer to where data is generated, rather than relying on a centralized cloud-based system. In layman's terms, Edge Computing involves relocating part of the storage and computing capabilities from a central data center to locations near the data sources.\nBy keeping computational capacity close to users, devices, or data sources, edge solutions offer benefits such as reduced latency, increased bandwidth, local device processing, and data offloading. For instance, smart speakers perform minimal computational work, sending requests to servers owned by the provider. With Edge Computing, smart speakers could process a user\u2019s request entirely on the device itself. Gartner, in its March 2024 Market Guide for Edge Computing, states:\n\u201cBy placing data, data management capabilities and analytic workloads at optimal points, ranging all the way to endpoint devices, enterprises can enable more real-time use cases. In addition, the flexibility to move data management workloads up and down the continuum from centralized data centers or from the cloud-to-edge devices will enable greater optimization of resources.\u201d\nThe automotive industry is a prime example of rapid advancements driven by edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI) integration in recent years. As vehicles evolve to incorporate self-driving capabilities, these technologies have become essential for effective decision-making and real-time responses. For instance, Tesla leverages extensive real-world driving data to refine its AI algorithms for autonomous driving. The rollout of EV maker's Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta software to more drivers highlights its performance in real-world conditions, with the vast amount of visual data collected during these drives enhancing the company's AI learning process.\nFurthermore, the advent and adoption of 5G, the fifth generation of cellular network technologies offering substantially greater bandwidth, is accelerating the growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and facilitating the widespread adoption of edge computing. With 5G networks enabling lightning-fast speeds and a greater number of connected devices, data volumes are expected to surge. Predictions state that by 2025, every connected person will interact with digital data at least once every 18 seconds, largely due to the billions of IoT devices projected to generate over 90 zettabytes of data by then.\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global edge computing market was valued at $15.96 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from $21.41 billion in 2024 to $216.76 billion by 2032, at a compound annual growth rate of 33.6% over the forecast period. This growth is fueled by the increasing adoption of edge devices, ranging from IoT devices such as mobile point-of-sale kiosks and smart cameras to computational infrastructure that enables faster and real-time data analysis at the source. On the other hand, PwC projects that the global market for edge data centers will nearly triple, growing from $4 billion in 2017 to $13.5 billion this year. This expansion is driven by the potential of locally situated data centers to reduce latency, manage intermittent connections, and facilitate data storage and computation close to end-users.\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best edge computing stocks to buy now.\nOur Methodology\nFor our list of the best edge computing stocks, We began by sifting through ETFs' holdings and online rankings to gather a preliminary list of 15 stocks. We then scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s first-quarter database which tracks 920 elite money managers and selected the top seven that were the most widely held by hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 293\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American multinational technology company based in Redmond, Washington. The company is best known for its software products, including the Windows operating systems, the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, and the Edge web browser. Microsoft Azure has rapidly gained prominence in the realm of edge computing by supporting edge initiatives in both hardware and software.\nAmong the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Texas-based Fisher Asset Management is a notable shareholder in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), holding 25.9 million shares valued at over $10.9 billion.\nNew Street Research recently initiated coverage of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) with a Buy rating, stating that the company is well positioned to grow profits in the \"low teens for years to come,\" even if the AI revolution doesn't fully materialize. They set a price target of $570 on the stock. Additionally, on June 14, Tigress Financial Partners updated their outlook on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), raising the 12-month price target to $550 and maintaining a Buy rating all the while emphasizing the company's strategic position to lead the AI revolution, which has been a key driver of its financial performance.\nIn its recent earnings report, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) posted a 17% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenue, reaching $61.9 billion. This growth was driven by strong performances across various segments, including a 23% increase in cloud revenue, totaling $35.1 billion. The expansion of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s cloud services, particularly Azure, played a central role in this success, supported by significant customer migration and a growing number of large Azure deals.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cOur second largest purchase during the quarter was the software platform,\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT), which we continued to add to, after initiating a position in the fourth quarter of 2023. Microsoft continues to report strong quarterly results, with revenue growth of 16% year-over-year in constant currency thanks to better-than-expected demand in its intelligent cloud segment, which saw revenue growth of 19% year-over-year, driven by Azure growth of 28% with AI contributing 6pts to growth compared with 3pts in the prior quarter. While the adoption of GenAI remains in its early stages, Microsoft has disclosed positive initial data points with 53,000 Azure AI customers as of its December quarter up from 18,000 in the prior quarter, 1.3 million paid GitHub Copilot subscribers (up 30% sequentially) and more than 230,000 organizations who have used AI capabilities in the power platform (up 80% sequentially). Management also noted that large cloud optimizations that started a year or so ago have largely finished. Profitability also continues to be strong with 44% non-GAAP operating margins, which was 120bps better than expected.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the best edge computing stocks to buy.

        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "When Satya Nadella became Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) third CEO in 2014, he vowed to transform the aging tech giant into a \"mobile first, cloud first\" company. That bold strategy boosted the company's annual revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2023 (which ended last June) as its earnings per share (EPS) grew at a CAGR of 16%. It also repurchased nearly 10% of its shares over the past 10 years.\nDuring that golden decade, Microsoft's stock rallied nearly 890%, which turned it into the world's second-most-valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion. A lot of that growth has been driven by Azure, which expanded into one of the three dominant leaders of the booming cloud computing market.\nBelow is a fresh look at Azure, how fast it's growing, and why it will likely remain Microsoft's most important business for the foreseeable future.\nMicrosoft launched Azure in 2008 to provide cloud-based infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) tools to large companies. Instead of installing more on-site servers -- which are expensive, consume lots of power, take up valuable space, and require constant maintenance -- companies could simply rent that computing and storage power from Azure as usage-based or subscription-based services.\nSatya Nadella previously led Microsoft's cloud and enterprise group before becoming its CEO, so he recognized the growth potential of Azure's cloud platform. But when he took the helm, Azure was still a lot smaller than Amazon\u00a0Web Services (AWS), which had already established a first-mover's advantage in the market.\nTo narrow that gap, Microsoft aggressively invested in Azure -- even though that strategy temporarily squeezed its operating margins. It expanded its ecosystem with more tools, locked in big retailers like Walmart and Target (which directly competed against Amazon), and invested in OpenAI to integrate the start-up's generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools into its own cloud services.\nAzure's expansion supported Microsoft's transformation of its desktop-based Office and Dynamics applications into cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. That shift drove the company to launch mobile versions of its flagship applications for iOS and Android devices, tether its Windows OS to more cloud-based services, and launch cloud-based gaming platforms for its Xbox consoles.\nBack in 2015, Microsoft set an ambitious goal of growing its annual cloud revenue from $6.3 billion to $20 billion by fiscal 2018. It surpassed that target ahead of schedule in fiscal 2017, and that figure soared to $110 billion (52% of its total revenue) in fiscal 2023. More than half of its total cloud revenue came from Azure during that year.\nAccording to Synergy Research, Azure's share of the global cloud infrastructure market grew from 14% to 26% between the fourth quarters of calendar 2017 and 2023. During that same period, AWS' share dipped from 32% to 31%, while Alphabet's\u00a0Google Cloud grew its share from 8% to 10%.\nThose figures suggest that Azure and Google Cloud might be chipping away at AWS' dominant market share, but they're also pulling a lot of business away from smaller competitors that lack the scale to keep pace with the three cloud leaders.\nMicrosoft doesn't disclose its exact revenue or operating-income figures for Azure's cloud infrastructure business. Instead, it only reports the year-over-year growth rate of its \"Azure and other cloud services\" segment on a quarterly basis.\nThis segment grew at more than 60% throughout most of fiscal 2020 but cooled off to the high-20s and low-30s over the past year. That slowdown wasn't surprising, since the macro headwinds drove many companies to rein in their cloud spending, but Azure's revenue growth actually accelerated over the past three quarters.\nMetric\nQ3 2023\nQ4 2023\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2024\nQ3 2024\nAzure and other cloud services revenue growth (year over year)\n27%\n26%\n29%\n30%\n31%\nData source: Microsoft. Chart by author.\nThat acceleration can be attributed to bigger AI workloads -- which are driving more companies to scale up their cloud infrastructure services -- and the integration\u00a0of OpenAI's popular generative AI tools into its own cloud-based services.\nAnalysts expect Microsoft's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 15% and 17%, respectively, from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2026. Its stock isn't cheap at 33 times next year's earnings, but its scale and diversification justify that higher valuation. It's still an easy to stock to recommend for anyone who wants more exposure to the growing cloud, AI, and gaming markets.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Yasmin Khorram    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) has reached a $14.4 million settlement with California\u2019s Civil Rights Department over claims the company discriminated against employees who were on parental and disability leave.\nThe department announced today that the settlement, which is subject to court approval, means Microsoft has pledged to take numerous steps to prevent future employment abuses.\n\u201cBy allegedly penalizing employees for taking protected forms of leave, Microsoft failed to support workers when they needed to care for themselves or their families,\u201d Kevin Kish, director of California\u2019s Civil Rights Department, said in a statement. \u201cThe settlement announced today will provide direct relief to impacted workers and safeguard against future discrimination at the company.\u201d\nThe complaint said most of those affected have been women and disabled employees. It alleges that employees who used protected leave were given lower bonuses and unfavorable performance reviews.\nThe agency said that Microsoft \u201cfailed to take sufficient action to prevent discrimination from occurring, altering the career trajectory of women, people with disabilities and other employees who worked at the company, ultimately leaving them behind.\u201d\nAccording to legal filings, a three-year investigation by the agency found \u201cmanagers have commented negatively on employees\u2019 use of protected leave\u201d and \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s workplace culture discourages employees from using protected leave.\u201d\nIn an emailed statement to Yahoo Finance, a Microsoft spokesperson said the company \"is committed to an environment that empowers our employees to take leave when needed and provides the flexibility and support necessary for them to thrive professionally and personally. While we believe the agency\u2019s allegations are inaccurate, we will continue to listen, learn, and support our employees.\u201d\nThe complaint said impacted employees have suffered economic injuries such as lost earnings, lost future employment opportunities, plus other non-economic damages.\nImpacted Microsoft workers employed between May 2017 to when the court enters the judgment will be eligible for compensation from a $14.2 million settlement fund. The remainder of the settlement will go toward the agency\u2019s enforcement efforts.\nThe software giant, headquartered in Redmond, Wash., employs 6,700 workers in California and approximately 221,000 worldwide. As a leader in the artificial intelligence boom, its stock has jumped roughly 35% in the past year.\nUnder the proposed settlement, Microsoft will retain an independent consultant to make recommendations about the company\u2019s practices for workers' annual rewards and promotions. It'll also ensure its employees know how to raise complaints about discrimination. The company will be required to report its findings to the department.\nCalifornia\u2019s civil rights agency is cracking down on Big Tech. Last month it settled a $15 million sex-based discrimination lawsuit against Snap (SNAP). The social media company denied the allegations in the suit but said it agreed to settle to avoid a legal battle.\nLast December, a historic $54 million settlement was announced in a years-long discrimination lawsuit against video gaming firm Activision Blizzard, which was acquired by Microsoft that October.\nAt the time, Activision said in a statement: \"We appreciate the importance of the issues addressed in this agreement and we are dedicated to fully implementing all the new obligations we have assumed as part of it.\"\nMicrosoft is facing legal challenges on other fronts. Last week, the company and OpenAI were sued in Manhattan\u2019s federal court by the Center for Investigative Reporting over alleged copyright infringement. The nonprofit newsroom raised concerns over Microsoft\u2019s significant investment in the ChatGPT maker.\nMicrosoft is also facing a steep fine after the European Commission, the European Union's antitrust authority, announced last month that the company breached antitrust laws by bundling Teams with its other applications for businesses. The company could be fined up to 10% of its global revenue, which totaled $211 billion in 2023.\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith said in a statement, \"having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission's remaining concerns.\"\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.\nSatya Nadella\nThank you, Brett. We had a solid close to our fiscal year. All up annual revenue was more than $245 billion, up 15% year over year, and Microsoft Cloud revenue surpassed $135 billion, up 23%. Before I dive in, I want to offer some broader perspective on the AI platform shift. Similar to the Cloud, this transition involves both knowledge and capital-intensive investments.And as we go through this shift, we are focused on two fundamental things: first, driving innovation across a product portfolio that spans infrastructure and applications, so as to ensure that we are maximizing our opportunity while, in parallel, continuing to scale our cloud business and prioritizing fundamentals, starting with security.Second, using customer demand signal and time to value to manage our cost structure dynamically and generate durable long-term operating leverage.With that, let me highlight examples starting with Azure. Our share gains accelerated this year driven by AI. We expanded our data center footprint announcing investments across four continents. These are long-term assets around the world to drive growth for the next decade and beyond.We added new AI accelerators from AMD and NVIDIA as well as our own first-party silicon Azure Maia, and we introduced new Cobalt 100, which provides best-in-class performance for customers like Elastic, MongoDB, Siemens, Snowflake, and Teradata.We continue to see sustained revenue growth from migrations. Azure Arc is helping customers in every industry from ABB and Cathay Pacific to LaLiga to streamline their cloud migrations. We now have 36,000-odd customers, up 90% year over year.We remain the hyperscale cloud of choice for SAP and Oracle workloads Atos, Kohl's, Daimler Truck AG, Domino's, Helion, for example, all migrated their mission-critical SAP workloads to our Cloud, and with our Azure VMware solution, we offer the fastest and most cost-effective way for customers to migrate their VMware workloads, too.With Azure AI, we are building out the app server for the AI wave providing access to the most diverse selection of models to meet customers' unique cost, latency, and design considerations. All up, we now have over 60,000 Azure AI customers up nearly 60% year over year and average spend per customer continues to grow.Azure OpenAI service provides access to best-in-class frontier models, including as of this quarter GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini. It's being used by leading companies in every industry, including H&R Block, Suzuki, Swiss Re, Telstra as well as digital natives like Freshworks, Meesho, and Zomato.With Phi-3, we offer a family of powerful small language models, which are being used by companies like BlackRock, Emirates, Epic, ITC, Navy Federal Credit Union, and others. And with Models as a Service, we provide API access to third-party models, including as of last week, the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral.The number of paid Models as a Service customers more than doubled quarter over quarter, and we are seeing increased usage by leaders in every industry from Adobe and Bridgestone to Novo Nordisk and Palantir.Now on to data. Our Microsoft intelligent data platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, and governance along with seamless integration with all of our AI services. The number of Azure AI customers also using our data and analytics tools grew nearly 50% year over year.Microsoft Fabric, our AI-powered next-generation data platform, now has over 14,000 paid customers, including leaders in every industry. from Accenture and Kroger to Rockwell Automation and Zeiss, up 20% quarter over quarter. And this quarter, we introduced new first of their kind, real-time intelligence capabilities in Fabrics, so customers can unlock insights on high-volume, time-sensitive data.Now on to developer tools. GitHub Copilot is by far the most widely adopted AI-powered developer tool. Just over two years since its general availability, more than 77,000 organizations from BBVA, FedEx, and H&M to Infosys and Paytm have adopted CoPilot up 180% year over year. And we're going further with Copilot Workspace, we offer Copilot native end-to-end developer productivity across plan, build, test, debug, and deploy cycle.Copilot is driving GitHub growth all up. GitHub annual revenue run rate is now $2 billion. Copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub revenue growth this year and is already a larger business than all of GitHub was when we acquired it.We are also integrating generative AI across Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, automate workflows, or build a website. To date, over 480,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform, up 45% quarter over quarter. In total, we now have 48 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up 40% year over year.Now on to future work. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is becoming a daily habit for knowledge workers as it transforms work, workflow, and work artifacts. The number of people who use Copilot daily at work nearly doubled quarter over quarter as they use it to complete test faster, hold more effective meetings, and automate business workflows and processes.Copilot customers increased more than 60% quarter over quarter. Feedback has been positive with majority of enterprise customers coming back to purchase more seats, all up the number of customers with more than 10,000 seats more than doubled quarter over quarter, including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, Kyndryl, Novartis, and EY alone will deploy Copilot to 150,000 of its employees, and we are going further adding agent capabilities to Copilot.New Team Copilot can facilitate meetings and create an assigned task. And with Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot for Microsoft 365 and build custom Copilots that proactively respond to data and events using their own first and third-party business data. To date, 50,000 organizations from Carnival Corporation, Cognizant, and Eaton to KPMG, Majesco, and McKinsey have used Copilot Studio, up over 70% quarter over quarter.We're also extending Copilot to specific industries, including healthcare with DAX Copilot, more than 400 health care organizations, including Community Health Network, Intermountain, Northwestern Memorial Healthcare, and Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center have purchased DAX Copilot to date, up 40% quarter over quarter and the number of AI-generated clinical reports more than tripled.Copilot is also transforming ERP and CRM business applications. We again took share this quarter as customers like Thermo Fisher Scientific switch to Dynamics. Our new Dynamics 365 contact center is a Copilot first solution that infuses generative AI throughout the contact center workflow.Companies like 1-800-Flowers, Mediterranean Shipping, Synoptic will rely on it to deliver better customer support. And Dynamics 365 Business Central is now trusted by over 40,000 organizations for core ERP.Microsoft Teams has become essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate, and do business. We once again saw year-over-year usage growth. Teams premium has surpassed 3 million seats, up nearly 400% year over year as organizations like Dentsu, Eli Lilly, and FOR, chose it for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation.When it comes to devices, we introduced our new category of Copilot+ PCs this quarter. They are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever. They include a new system architecture designed to deliver best-in-class performance and breakthrough AI experiences. We are delighted by early reviews, and we are looking forward to the introduction of more Copilot+ PCs powered by all of our silicon and OEM partners in the coming months.More broadly, Windows 11 active devices increased 50% year over year, and we are seeing accelerated adoption of Windows 11 by companies like Carlsberg, E.ON, National Australia Bank.And now on to security. We continue to prioritize security above all else. We are doubling down on our Secure Future Initiative as we implement our principles of secure by design, secure by default, and secure operations. Through this initiative, we are also continually applying what we are learning and translating it into innovation for our customers, including how we approach AI.Over 1,000 paid customers used Copilot for security, including Alaska Airlines, Oregon State University, Petrofac, Wipro, WTW, and we are also securing customers' AI deployments with updates to Defender and Purview. All up, we now have 1.2 million security customers over 800,000, including Dell Technologies, Deutsche Telekom, TomTom use four or more workloads, up 25% year over year.And Defender for Cloud, our cloud security solutions, surpassed $1 billion in revenue over the past 12 months as we protect customer workloads across multi-cloud and hybrid environment.Now let me turn to our consumer businesses, starting with LinkedIn. LinkedIn continues to see accelerated member growth and record engagement 1.5 million pieces of content are shared every minute on the platform and video is now the fastest-growing format on LinkedIn with uploads up 34% year over year. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message to the right audience on a safe, trusted platform.And when it comes to our subscription businesses, premium sign-ups increased 51% this fiscal year, and we are adding even more value to our members and customers with new AI tools. Our reimagined AI-powered LinkedIn Premium experience is now available for every premium subscriber worldwide, helping them more easily and intuitively connect to opportunity, learn, and get career coaching. Finally, hiring took share for the second consecutive year.And now on to search, advertising, and news. We are ensuring that Bing, Edge, and Copilot collectively are driving more engagement and value to end users, publishers and advertisers. Our overall revenue ex-TAC increased 19% year over year, and we again took share across Bing and Edge.We continue to apply generative AI to pioneer new approaches to how people search and browse. Just last week, we announced we are testing a new generative search experience, which creates a dynamic response to users' query while maintaining click share to publishers.And we continue to drive record engagement with Copilot for the web. Consumers have used Copilot to create over 12 billion images and conduct 13 billion chats to date, up 150% since the start of the calendar year.Thousands of news and entertainment publishers trust us to reach new audiences with Microsoft Start. And in fact, we have paid them $1 billion over the last five years. We are helping advertisers increase their ROI, too. We have seen positive response to Performance Max, which uses AI to dynamically create and optimize ads and Copilot and Microsoft ad platform helps marketers create campaigns and troubleshoot using natural language.Now on to gaming. We now have over 500 million monthly active users across platforms and devices, and our content pipeline has never been stronger. We previewed a record 30 new titles at our showcase this quarter. 18 of them, such as Call of Duty, Black Ops 6 will be available on Game Pass. Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream games directly on devices they already have, including as of last month, Amazon Fire TV.Finally, we are bringing our IP to new audiences. Fallout, for example, made its debut as a TV show on Amazon Prime this quarter. It was the second most watched title on the platform ever and hours played on Game Pass for the Fallout franchise increased nearly 5x quarter over quarter.In closing, I'm energized about the opportunities ahead. We are investing for the long term in our fundamentals, in our innovation, and in our people.With that, let me turn it over to Amy.\nAmy Hood\nThank you, Satya. And good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $64.7 billion, up 15% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.95 and increased 10% and 11% in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, we again delivered double-digit top and bottom line growth with continued share gains across many of our businesses and record commitments to our Microsoft Cloud platform.Commercial bookings were significantly ahead of expectations and increased 17% and 19% in constant currency. This record commitment quarter was driven by growth in the number of $10 million-plus and $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365 and consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions.Commercial, remaining performance obligation, increased 20% and 21% in constant currency to $269 billion. Roughly 40% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year over year. The remaining portion recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 21%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was 97%.At a company level, Activision contributed a net impact of approximately 3 points to revenue growth, was a 2-point drag on operating income growth, and had a negative $0.06 impact to earnings per share.A reminder that this net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party and includes $938 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs.FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $36.8 billion and grew 21% and 22% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations.Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year over year to 69%, in line with expectations. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by improvement in Azure even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure.Company gross margin dollars increased 14% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year over year to 70%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly even with the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, integration, and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.Operating expenses increased 13% with 9 points from the Activision acquisition. At a total company level, head count at the end of June was 3% higher than a year ago. Operating income increased 15% and 16% in constant currency, and operating margins were 43%, relatively unchanged year over year.Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased slightly, driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier and improved operating leverage through continued cost discipline.Now to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $20.3 billion and grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results across all business units.Office commercial revenue grew 12% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 13% and 14% in constant currency with ARPU growth primarily from E5 momentum as well as Copilot for Microsoft 365.Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 7% year over year, with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although both segments continued to moderate. Office commercial licensing declined 9% and 7% in constant currency with continued customer shift to Cloud offerings.Office consumer revenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 10% to $82.5 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected performance across all businesses.Dynamics revenue grew 16%, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 19% and 20% in constant currency. We saw continued growth across all workloads and better-than-expected new business. Dynamics 365 now represents roughly 90% of total Dynamics revenue.Segment gross margin dollars increased 9% and 10% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year over year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by Office 365 as we scale our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, and operating income increased 12% and 13% in constant currency.Next, the intelligent cloud segment. Revenue was $28.5 billion, increasing 19% and 20% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21% and 22% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 30% in constant currency, in line with expectations and consistent with Q3 when adjusting for leap year.Azure growth included 8 points from AI services, where demand remained higher than our available capacity. In June, we saw slightly lower-than-expected growth in a few European geos. In our per user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 10% to over 281 million seats, with continued impact from moderated growth in seats sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. Therefore, our Azure consumption business continues to grow faster than total Azure.In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2% and 3% in constant currency. Growth was driven by demand for our hybrid solutions, although with slightly lower-than-expected transactional purchasing.Enterprise and partner services revenue decreased 7% on a strong prior year comparable for enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year over year.Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mix shift to Azure, partially offset by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even with the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. Operating expenses increased 5%, and operating income grew 22% and 23% in constant currency.Now to more personal computing. Revenue was $15.9 billion, increasing 14% and 15% in constant currency, with 12 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Results were above expectations, driven by Windows Commercial and Search. The PC market was as expected, and Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year over year.Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 11% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher in-period revenue recognition from the mix of contracts. Devices revenue decreased 11% and 9% in constant currency, roughly in line with expectations as we remain focused on our higher-margin premium products.While early days, we're excited about the recent launch of our Copilot+ PCs. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 19%, ahead of expectations, primarily due to improved execution. Healthy volume growth was driven by Bing and Edge.And in gaming, revenue increased 44% with 48 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61%, slightly ahead of expectations with 58 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.Stronger-than-expected performance in first-party content was partially offset by third-party content performance. Xbox hardware revenue decreased 42% and 41% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21% with 10 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition.Gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points year over year, primarily driven by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 43% with 41 points from the Activision acquisition, operating income increased 5% and 6% in constant currency.Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $19 billion, in line with expectations and cash paid for PP&E was $13.9 billion. Cloud and AI-related spend represents nearly all of our total capital expenditures. Within that, roughly half is for infrastructure needs where we continue to build and lease data centers that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond.The remaining cloud and AI-related spend is primarily for servers, both CPUs and GPUs to serve customers based on demand signals. For the full fiscal year, the mix of our cloud and AI-related spend was similar to Q4.Cash flow from operations was $37.2 billion, up 29% driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $23.3 billion, up 18% year over year, reflecting higher capital expenditures to support our cloud and AI offerings. For the full year, cash flow from operations surpassed $100 billion for the first time, reaching $119 billion.This quarter, other income expense was negative $675 million more favorable than anticipated with lower-than-expected interest expense and higher-than-expected interest income. Our losses on investments accounted for under the equity method were as expected. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%, higher than anticipated due to a state tax law signed in June that was affected retroactively.And finally, we returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our total cash return to shareholders to over $34 billion for the full fiscal year.Now moving to our outlook. My commentary for both the full year and next quarter is on a US dollar basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY25.First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full year revenue, COGS, or operating expense growth. Next, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth as we focus on delivering differentiated value for our customers. To meet the growing demand signal for our AI and cloud products, we will scale our infrastructure investments with FY25 capital expenditures expected to be higher than FY24.As a reminder, these expenditures are dependent on demand signals and adoption of our services that will be managed through the year. As scaling these investments drives growth in COGS, we will remain disciplined on operating expense management.Therefore, we expect FY25 OpEx growth to be in the single digits. And given our focused commitment to managing at the operating margin level, we still expect FY25 operating margins to be down only about one point year over year. And finally, we expect our FY25 effective tax rate to be around 19%.Now to the outlook for our first quarter. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue and segment level revenue growth by less than one point. We expect FX to decrease COGS growth by less than one point and to have no meaningful impact to operating expense growth.In commercial bookings, increased long-term commitments to our platform and strong execution across core annuity sales motions should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can derive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 70%, down year over year, driven by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure. We expect capital expenditures to increase on a sequential basis given our cloud and AI demand as well as existing AI capacity constraints. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure build-outs and the timing of delivery of finance leases.Next is segment guidance. In productivity and business processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10% and 11% in constant currency or USD20.3 billion to USD20.6 billion. In office commercial, revenue growth will again driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5 and Copilot for Microsoft 365. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be approximately 14% in constant currency.In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid- to high teens. In office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high single digits driven by continued growth across all businesses.And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens, driven by Dynamics 365. For intelligent cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 18% and 20% in constant currency or USD28.6 billion to USD28.9 billion.Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q1 revenue growth to be 28% to 29% in constant currency.Growth will continue to be driven by our consumption business, inclusive of AI, which is growing faster than total Azure. We expect the consumption trends from Q4 and to continue through the first half of the year. This includes both AI demand impacted by capacity constraints and non-AI growth trends similar to June. Growth in our per user business will continue to moderate.And in H2, we expect Azure growth to accelerate as our capital investments create an increase in available AI capacity to serve more of the growing demand.In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low single digits as continued hybrid demand will be more than offset by lower transactional purchasing. And in enterprise and partner services revenue should decline in the low single digits.And more personal computing, we expect revenue to grow between 9% and 12% in constant currency or USD14.9 billion to USD15.3 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be relatively flat, roughly in line with the PC market.In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the mid-single digits. As a reminder, our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In devices, revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits.Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the mid- to high teens. This will be higher than overall search and news advertising revenue growth, which we expect to be in the low-single digits.And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-30s, including approximately 40 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-50s, driven by the net impact from the Activision acquisition. Hardware revenue will again decline year over year.Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between USD19.95 billion to USD20.5 billion, including approximately $700 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. We expect operating expense of USD15.2 billion to USD15.3 billion, including approximately $200 million from purchase accounting, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition.Other income and expense should be roughly negative $650 million, driven by losses on investments accounted for under the equity method as interest income will be mostly offset by interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.In closing, we remain focused on delivering innovations that matter to our global customers of every size. That focus extends to delivering on our financial commitments as well. We delivered operating margin growth of nearly 3 points year over year even as we accelerate our AI investments, completed the Activision acquisition, and had a headwind from the change in useful lives last year.So as we begin FY25, we will continue to invest in the cloud and AI opportunity ahead, aligned, and if needed, adjusted to the demand signals we see. We are committed to growing our leadership across our commercial cloud and within that, the AI platform, and we feel well positioned as we start FY25.With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.\nBrett Iversen\nThanks, Amy. We'll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley.\nKeith Weiss\nThanks. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and congratulations on another great quarter and really solid overall fiscal year. Right now, there's an industry debate ranging around the CapEx requirements around generative AI and whether the monetization is actually going to match with that. And I think the question for you guys, from a Microsoft perspective, is CapEx still an appropriate leading indicator for cloud growth?Or does the shift in gross margin profile change that equation? Or said another way, maybe can you give us a little bit more help in understanding the timing between the CapEx investments and the yield on those investments? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella\nThank you, Keith. Let me start, and then Amy can add to this. I think, I would say we primarily start right now from the demand side. What I mean by that is what's the product -- shape of the product portfolio, what we learned even from the cloud transition, which, as you know, Keith, was similar in the sense that it was both a knowledge intensive and a capital-intensive transition.We needed to have the product portfolio where there was the right mix of, I'll call it, infrastructure meters as well as SaaS applications. So that's the first thing that we are looking at.And how is that value landing with customers and what's the growth rate. So when I think about what's happening with M365 Copilot as perhaps the best Office 365 or M365 suite we have had, the fact that we're getting recurring customers, so our customers coming back buying more seats. So GitHub Copilot now being bigger than even GitHub when we bought it. What's happening in the contact center with Dynamics.So I would say -- and obviously, the Azure AI growth, that's the first place we look at. That, then, drives bulk of the CapEx spend, basically, that's the demand signal because you got to remember, even in the capital spend, there is land and there is data center build, but 60%-plus is the kit, that only will be bought for inferencing and everything else if there is demand signal, right? So that's, I think, the keyway to think about capital cycle even.The asset, as Amy said, is a long-term asset, which is land and the data center, which, by the way, we don't even construct things fully. We can even have things which are semi-constructive, we call coal, shelves, and so on. So we know how to manage our CapEx spend to build out a long-term asset and a lot of the hydration of the kit happens when we have the demand signal.There is definitely spend for training. Even there, of course, we will only be scaling training as we see the demand accrue in any given period in time. So I would say it's more important to manage to capture the opportunity with the right product portfolio that's driving value.And on that front, I feel good about the breadth of Microsoft offering, whether it's in consumer side, whether it's on commercial per seat side or on the consumption meters, that's, I think, the fundamental driver.\nAmy Hood\nAnd Keith, I do think -- and I really do appreciate how you phrased the question as well because I think the timing and some of the questions you all have had really led to how we were talking even about capital expense in our comments -- in my comments today.Being able to maybe share a little more about that when we talked about roughly half of FY24's total capital expense as well as half of Q4's expense, it's really on land and build and finance leases, and those things really will be monetized over 15 years and beyond.And they're incredibly flexible because we've built a consistent architecture first with the commercial cloud and second with the Azure stack for AI, regardless of whether the demand is at the platform layer or at the app layer or through third parties and partners or, frankly, our first-party SaaS, it uses the same infrastructure. So it's a long-lived flexible assets.And if you think about it, that way, you can see what we're doing and focused on is building out this network in parallel across the globe. Because when we did this last transition -- the first transition to the cloud, which seems a long time ago sometimes. It rolled out quite differently.We rolled out more geo by geo and this one because we have demand on a global basis, we are doing it on a global basis, which is important. We have large customers in every geo. And so hopefully, with that shape of our capital expense, it helps people see how much of that is near-term monetization driver as well as a much longer duration.\nKeith Weiss\nThank you very much,\nBrett Iversen\nThanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator\nMark Moerdler, Bernstein Research.\nMark Moerdler\nThank you for taking the question and congrats on a strong year. GenAI has been a bit of roller coaster of a tech over the last year with periods of acceleration, high expectations, and the expectations drop as reality kicked in. With Azure growth we've seen this quarter and O365 Commercial, not yet fully visible in numbers even though Amy, you gave us a lot of color on it.Two quick parts to the question. Satya, how should we think about what it's going to take for GenAI to become more real across the industry and for it to become more visible within your SaaS offerings?And Amy, with cloud, it took time for margins to improve. It looks like with AI, it's happening quicker. Can you give us a sense of how you think about the margin impact near term and long term from all the investment on AI? Thank you.\nSatya Nadella\nYes. Thanks again, Mark, for the question. So to me, look, at the end of the day, GenAI is just software. So it is really translating into fundamentally growth on what has been our M365 SaaS offering with a newer offering that is the Copilot SaaS offering, which, today, is on a growth rate that's faster than any other previous generation of software we launched as a suite in M365.That's, I think, the best way to describe it. I mean the numbers I think we shared even this quarter are indicative of this, Mark. So if you look at it, we have both the landing of the seats itself quarter over quarter that growing 60%, right? That's a pretty good healthy sign.The most healthy sign for me is the fact that customers are coming back there. That is the same customers with whom we landed the seats coming back and buying more seats. And then the number of customers with 10,000-plus seats doubled, right? It's 2x quarter over quarter. That, to me, is a healthy SaaS core business.And on top of that, some of the things that Amy shared are on Dynamic. That's another exciting place for us, which is, one, we are gaining share. We are -- Dynamics with the GenAI built-in is really biz app, it's probably the category that gets completely transformed with GenAI.Contact centers being a great example. We ourselves are on course to save hundreds of millions of dollars in our own customer support and contact center operations. I think we can drive that value to our customers.And then on the Azure side, you see the numbers very clearly. In fact, I think last quarter is when we started giving you that. You saw an acceleration of that this quarter. One of the other pieces, Mark, is AI doesn't sit on its own, right? So it's just for -- we have a concept of design wins in Azure. So in fact, 50% of the folks who are using Azure AI are also using a data meter.That's very exciting to us because the most important thing in Azure is to win workloads in the enterprise. And that is starting to happen. And these are generational things once they get going with you. So that's, I think, how we think about it at least when I look at what's happening on our demand side.\nAmy Hood\nAnd, Mark, to answer the second half of your question on margin improvement looking different than it did through the last cloud cycle. That's primarily for a reason I've mentioned a couple of times. We have a consistent platform. So because we're building to on Azure AI stack, we don't have to have multiple infrastructure investments.We're making one. We're using that internally first party, and that's what we're using with customers to build on as well as ISVs. So it does, in fact, make margins start off better and obviously scale consistently.\nMark Moerdler\nThank you.\nBrett Iversen\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator\nKash Rangan, Goldman Sachs.\nKasthuri Rangan\nHi. Thank you very much and congrats on a great year -- fiscal year ending. A question for you, Amy. When you look at the CapEx, how do you ring efficiencies out of the CapEx? You've disclosed that 50% of the infrastructure, the other 50% tech, is very useful.So in other words, do you have to keep growing CapEx at these elevated rates? Or could you slow down CapEx and still get that consistent revenue growth rate in your Azure and generative AI? That's the main question in my mind. Thank you so much.\nAmy Hood\nThanks, Kash. That's a very good question. There's really two pieces, I think, as I heard your question that I would reflect on. The first is, could we see consistent revenue growth without maybe what you would say is more of this elevated capital expense number or something that continues to accelerate.And the answer to that is yes because there's two different pieces, right? You're seeing half of this go toward long-term builds that Satya mentioned, the pace at which we fill those builds with CPUs or GPUs will be demand-driven.And so if we see differences in demand signal, we can throttle that investment on the CPU side, which we've done for, I guess, a long time at this point, as I reflect, and we'll use all that same learning and demand signal understand to do the same thing on the GPU side.And so you're right that you could see relatively consistent revenue patterns and yet see these inconsistencies and capital spend quarter to quarter.The other thing I would note, Kash, is you'll also notice there's a growing distinction between our CapEx number, and on occasion, the cash that we pay for PP&E and you're going to start to see that more often in this period because it happens when we use leases.Leases show up all at once. And so you'll see a little bit more volatility. I've mentioned it back in my comments before, but I mentioned it again just because you're starting to see that distinction in my comments and hopefully that's helpful context.\nSatya Nadella\nJust one other thing, Amy, if I want to add. I think as people think about capital spend, I think it's important to separate out leases from build. And when it comes to build, I think it's important for us to think about -- we think about it in terms of what's the total percentage of cost that goes into each line item, land which obviously has a very different duration and a very different lead time.So those are the other two considerations. We think about lead time and duration of the asset. Land, network, construction, the system or the kit, and then the ongoing cost. And so if you think about it that way, then you know how to even adjust, if you will, the capital spend based on demand signal.\nKasthuri Rangan\nThank you. It was triggered by the jump in CapEx. And as Amy pointed out, you're guiding to accelerating -- Azure revenue growth rate, which, I guess, follows the CapEx surge. Thank you so much.\nBrett Iversen\nThanks, Kash. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator\nBrent Thill, Jefferies.\nBrent Thill\nThanks. Amy, the magnitude to beat this quarter was a little lower than we've seen in the past. Was there anything unusual on sales cycle that close rate that you saw off?\nAmy Hood\nThanks, Brent. Actually, no. As I was talking on the quarter, I mean commercial bookings were much better than we expected going into the quarter. Commitments were very good execution across both the core annuity renewal motion was good, as expected, the larger long-term commitments were better than we expected.So Brent, I would not say there was anything really unusual in how I thought about what we saw in our commercial execution through the quarter.\nBrent Thill\nGreat. Thank you.\nBrett Iversen\nThanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator\nKarl Keirstead, UBS.\nKarl Keirstead\nOkay. Great. So maybe I'll direct this to Amy. Amy, I know when you set your Azure guidance, you're always looking to meet or beat the high end the 30% you put up in the June quarter, amazing number given the scale of Azure, but it did come in at the low end of your range.And I'd just love for you to maybe elaborate on the delta. I guess as I reflect on what you said in your comments, there's two things that I heard you say. One, it sounded like there's persistent capacity constraints that you think might get alleviated in the second half.And then, secondly, you mentioned perhaps some modest softness in Europe. I presume that's a little bit more economic rather than Azure-specific. Is that the right way to frame the performance in the quarter? Thank you.\nAmy Hood\nThanks, Karl. Yes, that's exactly right. Maybe I'll just repeat it, just so people can hear it in my words as well to that 30% to 31% guide for Q4 and coming in at the lower end of 30%. You're exactly right.The distinguishing between being at the higher end or at the lower end, really was some softness we saw in a few European geos on non-AI consumption really made the difference in that number. And we've assumed that going forward into H1 inclusive of my guide 28% to 29% going forward.And then let me separate which was your larger point, which is what are the other factors you see ongoing. Number one, you're right, capacity constraints, particularly on AI and Azure will remain in Q4 and will remain in H1. So hopefully, that's helpful.\nKarl Keirstead\nYeah. Thank you, Amy.\nBrett Iversen\nThanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator\nBrad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick\nGreat. Thank you very much. Amy, with Azure demand, once again greater than available capacity, I appreciate the CapEx investments and the build-out and acceleration you expect in the back half. But as we think about cloud capacity and AI services specifically, can you talk about both the near-term and long-term strategy around the AI partnerships that you're signing with the likes of Oracle and Cohere, for example? Thank you.\nAmy Hood\nThanks, Brad. Maybe separate a couple of things. We are -- and we've talked about now for quite a few quarters, we are constrained on AI capacity. And because of that, actually, we've, to your point, have signed up with third parties to help us as we are behind with some leases on AI capacity.We've done that with partners who are happy to help us extend the Azure platform, to be able to serve this Azure AI demand. And you do see us investing quite a bit as we've talked about in builds so that we can get back in a more balanced place.\nSatya Nadella\nYes. I mean, to me, it's no different than leases that we would have done in the past. These -- even say sometimes buying from Oracle, maybe even more efficient leases because they're even shorter date.\nBrad Zelnick\nExcellent. Thanks for the color.\nBrett Iversen\nThanks, Brad. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator\nMark Murphy, JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy\nThank you very much. With a couple of quarters of Copilot for M365 availability under your belt now, how are you assessing the capability of Copilot to replicate the productivity gains that they've created for developers, which seem to be very high and to do something similar for the broader population of knowledge workers?For instance, you're mentioning the 10,000 feet deals, the repeat purchases, is it possible to eventually see co-pilot penetration rate equally high in office as they will be in GitHub?\nSatya Nadella\nYeah, that's a great question. In fact, the GitHub design system and the GitHub Copilot workspace design system, which now, for example, you start with an issue, you create a plan, from a plan, you create a spec, or you create a spec and from a spec, you create a plan and then you go operate across the full repo. That's effectively the design system that is getting replicated inside of even the M365 Copilot.And you see this even now -- for example, you get an email, you're in sales, you want to respond to the customer. The data from the email is essentially context for a prompt but you expand by bringing in all of your CRM data, right? So this customer email is in the context of some order, all of the CRM record gets completed in context and a reply gets generated with the CRM data. That's the type of stuff that's already happening.Then you take something like Copilot Studio, you can start even grounding it in more data and then completing workflows. So you could say if this email comes from this customer whose order date is got a particular issue with it. You can then go and escalate it to somebody else who gets a notification in Teams.And those are the kinds of workflows that are getting built within IT or by end users themselves, what used to be line of business applications to us are Copilot extensions going forward. So we think of this as really a new design system for knowledge and frontline work to drive productivity, which would be very akin to what has happened in software engineering.So when you think about marketing or finance or sales or customer service, we will effectively replicate what you just said, which is the type of productivity we've seen in developers, will come to all of these functions as they think about their work, workflow and workout effect, all being driven by Copilots.\nMark Murphy\nThanks.\nBrett Iversen\nThanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator\nKeith Bachman, BMO Capital Markets.\nKeith Bachman\nI actually wanted to veer towards gaming, if I could, for a second. Xbox Content Services revenue grew 61%, 58 points held from Activision. So net is about 3 points of growth. How should investors think about the longer-term growth potential in this area?You've made significant investments, including the Activision deal. But how should investors be thinking about the growth potential of the gaming? Or what are the puts and takes to help make considerations here?\nSatya Nadella\nYes. For us, our investment in gaming fundamentally was to have, I would say, the right portfolio of both what we love about gaming and always have loved about gaming, which is Xbox and the content for the console and expand from there so that we have content for everywhere people play games, starting with the PC.So when I think about the Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console. And then, of course, assets to cover mobile sockets, which we never have. So we feel that now we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high scale platforms where people play games, which is the console, PC, and mobile.But we're also excited about these new sockets, right? I mean the fact that even in this last quarter, we expanded X Cloud to Amazon TV, I forget the name of what it's called. But that's the type of new access that really helps us a lot, get reach new gamers or the same gamer everywhere they want to play.And that ultimately will show up in that software plus services and transaction revenue for us, which is really our long-term KPI, and that's what we're building towards. And that was strategy behind Activision as an asset.Amy, if you want to add to it?\nAmy Hood\nNo, I do think the real goal here is to be able to take a broad set of content to more users in more places, and really build what looks more like to us, the software annuity and subscription business. with enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP, which is quite valuable long term.As Satya mentioned, things where with the ownership of IP, it can be monetized in multiple ways. And I think we're really encouraged by some of the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass as well with some of the new announcements. Thank you, Keith.\nBrett Iversen\nThanks, Keith. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today's earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.\nAmy Hood\nThank you.\nSatya Nadella\nThank you all.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.\n"

Prior to the acquisition, Activision was battling the state of California and the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, after the state and agency filed lawsuits accusing the company of violating civil rights laws.\nThese lawsuits were part of an ongoing battle with Activision, sparked by an employee walkout in 2021. The walkout came after the Department of Fair Employment and Housing in California filed a complaint alleging a \u201cfrat boy culture\u201d and harassment at the company. In the end, Activision paid an eight-figure settlement to resolve the dispute; however, the settlement also meant that all parties agreed that \u201cno court or any independent investigation has substantiated any allegations that there has been systemic or widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard.\u201d\nIn 2022, Microsoft announced a set of principles designed to facilitate unionization. Microsoft maintains an uncharacteristically union-friendly stance, supporting its employees' right to unionize and committing to good-faith negotiations with the CWA. As such, Microsoft Corp agreed to voluntarily recognize and negotiate with the union if majority support was secured, reflecting its ongoing commitment to a collaborative approach to unionization.\nMicrosoft has adopted a similar approach to organizing efforts by other American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) unions. The tech giant is also partnering with AFL-CIO represents to understand the impact of artificial intelligence on workers.\nThe decision to unionize by the World of Warcraft team is part of a broader trend that includes unionization victories at Apple, Amazon, Volkswagen and Starbucks.\nThese efforts reflect a growing movement toward organized labour in various high-profile workplaces since the start of the pandemic.\nRead more: Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year \u2014 but you can be smarter than that.

The study authors found that, for publicly traded firms, the process of unionization led to a decrease in market value.\nAccording to the study data, in the two years after NLS unionized the firm experienced an abnormal decline in profits that resulted in a -75% return. Similar companies in this sector reported a -10% loss during the same time period.\nWhen factoring in rising worker costs and lost profits due to inefficiencies, report authors David Lee and Alexandre Mas concluded that each newly unionized NLS worker cost the firm approximately $40,500. This equity loss due to unionization can take 15 to 18 months to full materialize.\nThe impact on Microsoft's market value could follow the pattern identified in the Princeton study \u2014 with a decline in profit and shareholder value over the next few years; however, authors Lee and Mas both acknowledged that not all transitions to a unionized workforce lead to big profit declines. Plus, not all declines had longevity.\nThere are a variety of strategies to consider when significant changes take shape in a well-capitalized, profitable company, like Microsoft Corp.\nFor the next 12 months, investors may want to consider how to use the potential shifts in the profitability of Microsoft Corp. stock.\nFor instance, this may be an opportunity for investors to buy stock in Microsoft Corp., assuming that the tech giant will rebound from the temporary changes imposed by the unionization of the workforce.\nFor bearish investors, this could be an opportunity to short-sell \u2014 capitalize on the belief that stock prices for Microsoft Corp. will decline.\nAs with all investment decisions, the key is to investigate and only execute on a trade if it follows your investment plan and strategy.\nCost-of-living in America is still out of control \u2014 use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says\nJeff Bezos and Oprah Winfrey invest in this asset to keep their wealth safe \u2014 you may want to do the same in 2024\nStop crushing your retirement dreams with wealth-killing costs and headaches \u2014 here are 10 'must-haves' when choosing a trading platform (and 1 option that has them all)\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

It's made headlines as the world's second-most valuable company, but what often gets overlooked is the dividend. While Microsoft's paltry yield of less than 1% is nothing to brag about at the moment, it's certainly something to keep an eye on as the company approaches two decades of dividend increases.\nHere's a quick answer. Microsoft has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share for fiscal year 2024 (which ended on June 30). On an annual basis, this totals $3.00 per share. \nIf you add up all the shares of Microsoft stock outstanding -- 7.43 billion as of the latest financial reports --\u00a0and multiply this by the annual dividend per share of $3.00, you get a dividend payout of approximately $22.29 billion this year. \nIt's likely that the total dividend payout number quoted above will not be the exact amount Microsoft will shell out to shareholders in 2024. For one, the number of outstanding shares can change, affecting the total payout. Also, a dividend hike could be coming before the end of the year, as Microsoft typically announces a dividend increase in September, though nothing is set in stone yet.\nSo far this year, Microsoft has paid a dividend of $0.75 per share in March and June. Investors have already received word that another $0.75 per share dividend will hit their accounts in September. However, the fourth dividend payment of the year, if there is one, is still up in the air. If dividend trends continue, shareholders will likely receive a pay raise in December, bumping up the total dividend payout for 2024.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Helping to found Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) nearly 50 years ago, Bill Gates is widely recognized as one of the wealthiest individuals in the world. Forbes, for example, estimates Gates's net worth at about $135 billion. He's also one of the most philanthropic. Valued at $46 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2024, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation performs charitable work in more than 130 countries -- from assisting with agricultural development to improving financial resources for low-income communities.\nBut how much exactly does Microsoft represent in the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust's portfolio? Let's take a look.\nWhile some smaller companies represent nominal positions in the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, most of the holdings are well-recognized names. Trash pickup and disposal specialist Waste Management, Berkshire Hathaway, and Canadian National Railway each account for about 16% of the trust's portfolio as of the end of Q1 2024. And then there's Microsoft, which holds a commanding position among tech stocks with a market capitalization of $3.4 trillion, dwarfing its closest peer, Oracle, which has a market cap of $398 billion.\nOf the 24 holdings in the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust's portfolio, Microsoft is the largest holding, making up about 34% of the portfolio and valued at about $15.4 billion. It's not only the sizable standing, however, that's worth noting. The 36,499,597 shares also generate a considerable amount of dividend income -- more than $27 million in Q2 2024.\nAlthough Microsoft provides the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust with a prodigious amount of passive income, it's unlikely that the forward-yielding dividend of 0.64% is going to excite most income investors. Those looking for artificial intelligence (AI) exposure, however, should consider Microsoft as its generative AI chatbot Copilot grows in popularity. On Microsoft's recent Q3 2024 conference call, management noted that \"Thirty thousand organizations across every industry have used Copilot studio to customize Copilot for Microsoft 365 or build their own, up 175% quarter over quarter.\"\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "It\u2019s for the best that Microsoft and Apple won\u2019t be observing OpenAI\u2019s board meetings",
        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "OpenAI\u2019s board meetings were about to get really weird, with not one but two major customers and partners sitting in as observers. But that awkward situation has suddenly been averted.\nMicrosoft, OpenAI\u2019s biggest partner and investor, has been a board observer since last year\u2019s leadership crisis, in which Microsoft and everyone else were shocked by OpenAI's board abruptly and briefly firing CEO Sam Altman. And, as I wrote last week, Apple, which plans to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, was reportedly about to get the same privilege.\nHowever, it emerged today that Microsoft has dropped its observer role with immediate effect, and Apple won\u2019t take one either. Microsoft reportedly told OpenAI in a letter that its seven months observing meetings \u201cprovided insights into the board\u2019s activities without compromising its independence,\u201d and the role was no longer necessary because \u201cwe have witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board and are confident in the company\u2019s direction.\u201d\nInstead of having board observers, OpenAI said it will now just hold regular meetings with its strategic partners and investors. This seems a far more sensible approach, for multiple reasons.\nFirstly, while European antitrust officials earlier this year dropped a probe into Microsoft\u2019s relationship with OpenAI\u2014they conceded Microsoft had not taken control of its partner\u2014there\u2019s now a broader EU review taking place, covering strategic investments and partnerships across the entire AI industry. Regulators in the U.K. and U.S. are also paying close attention. This is not a time for Microsoft and OpenAI to appear overly cozy.\nSecondly\u2026well, here I\u2019m going to hand things over to Data Sheet reader JE, who wrote me this in response to last week\u2019s essay about the subject:\n\u201cThe issue of letting major customers sit in on board meetings would seem to raise all kinds of issues. As the retired chair of the board of a publicly traded company, I would have real concerns about how we could have functioned with customers or even large shareholders sitting in on what should be candid, serious and confidential discussions\u2026I question how this \u2018observation\u2019 can be helpful if open-ended. Having input and discussion for a defined topic and time in meetings with customers is fine; attending meetings as an observer or participant is not.\u201d\nDoubly so if two competing customers like Microsoft and Apple are both in the room, I imagine.\nSince we\u2019re on the subject of AI, Elon Musk\u2019s xAI startup has decided to build its own data center systems rather than continuing its server rental agreement with Oracle. The Information had the scoop and the man himself confirmed it on X, where he said xAI\u2019s only chance of catching up with more established rivals was to move faster than them.\n\u201cOracle is a great company\u2026but, when our fate depends on being the fastest by far, we must have our own hands on the steering wheel, rather than be a backseat driver,\u201d Musk tweeted.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. has for the first time accused another country of using generative AI in a foreign influence campaign, Reuters reports. You will be shocked to hear that Russia is the alleged miscreant\u2014a Russian organization apparently designed an AI-powered bot farm to spread disinformation in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nFinally, Fortune AI maestro Jeremy Kahn has a new book out! It\u2019s called Mastering AI: A Survival Guide to Our Superpowered Future and I for one can\u2019t wait to read it. We published an excerpt yesterday\u2014which appropriately focuses on AI\u2019s potential for surreptitiously influencing people\u2014and you can also read Jeremy\u2019s own rundown of the book\u2019s key themes in yesterday\u2019s Eye On AI essay.\nMore news below.\nDavid Meyer\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

As reported by GamesIndustry.biz, the figures showed that Microsoft's gaming revenue is up by 44% compared to the same period last year, while revenue from Xbox content and services is up 61% compared to the same financial quarter from the previous financial year.\nIn an investor's call following the report, Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood was asked how investors should think about the growth of Microsoft's gaming business. \"I do think the real goal here is to be able to take a broad set of content to more users in more places, and really build what looks like more to us, the software annuity and subscription business,\" Hood responded.\nThat's a long way of Hood saying that Microsoft wants Xbox to focus more on the subscription side of the business, like Xbox Game Pass, in order to get its IPs in front of more people. \"It can be monetized in multiple ways,\" Hood said of Xbox's IPs, adding \"I think we're really encouraged by some of the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass.\"\nAgain, that's a long way of saying that Microsoft is broadly pleased with how Xbox Game Pass is panning out for its business. It's not really a surprise to hear that Microsoft is betting big with Xbox Game Pass growth after Xbox's decision to launch Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 via the subscription service on day one later this year on October 25.\nTake a look at our upcoming Xbox Series X games guide for an overview of all the other first-party games that will be on the service on day one.\n"

Analysts polled by FactSet Research had been looking for revenue of $64.4 billion.\nMicrosoft's growth was led by its cloud computing business, where quarterly revenue rose 19% to $28.5 billion. That was still lower than what some analysts expected, leading to the stock shedding about 5% in after-hours trading Tuesday.\nThe Redmond, Washington-based company doesn\u2019t report revenue specifically from AI products but says it has infused the technology into all of its business segments, particularly its Azure cloud computing contracts, but increasingly its workplace software and other products. Much of its generative AI technology has been built as part of its multibillion-dollar investments in OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT.\nRevenue from Microsoft's productivity services \u2013 such as its Office line of products \u2013 rose 11% to $20.3 billion.\nMicrosoft\u2019s personal computing business, centered on licensing its Windows operating system, made $15.9 billion for the quarter, up 14% from last year.\n"

Elsewhere, the Dow saw an upswing of 0.53%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq appreciated by 0.4%.\nHeading into today, shares of the software maker had gained 2.48% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.22% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.78% in that time.\nThe upcoming earnings release of Microsoft will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.90, reflecting a 7.81% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $64.16 billion, reflecting a 14.19% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\nInvestors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Microsoft. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month. Right now, Microsoft possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Microsoft has a Forward P/E ratio of 34.41 right now. This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 30.81.\nAlso, we should mention that MSFT has a PEG ratio of 2.14. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The average PEG ratio for the Computer - Software industry stood at 2.49 at the close of the market yesterday.\nThe Computer - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 102, finds itself in the top 41% echelons of all 250+ industries.\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups.

Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\nWhile it's common for investors to rely on consensus earnings and revenue estimates for assessing how the business may have performed during the quarter, exploring analysts' forecasts for key metrics can yield valuable insights.\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Microsoft metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- Productivity and Business Processes' of $20.10 billion.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF.\u00a0Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nOver the past few months the market has seen a massive influx of AI-related ETFs as investors look to ride the bandwagon of AI investing. A report from Wall Street Journal in June said that all ten AI ETFs tracked by website ETF.com saw inflows this year. One major AI ETF, launched by Roundhill, saw its assets grow to $35 million from under $1 million in just two weeks.\nAmid the craze of AI ETFs, does it make sense to start investing in every new ETF? Analysts offer some guidance. A Wall Street Journal report quoted Morningstar analyst Kenneth Lamont, who said that we should look for \u201cthematic purity\u201d while investing in AI ETFs. The ETF you choose, according to the analyst, must be investing in \u201cbellwether\u201d stocks positioned to benefit from the AI industry trends.\nThere is a new AI ETF in town. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), launched earlier this month, tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, which captures the performance of AI tech companies. The index seeks exposure to three main AI categories: hardware, infrastructure, and applications. The index picks companies by assigning \u00a0AI Exposure Score, which assesses each company\u2019s relevance to AI tech. You can get exposure to AI companies focusing on data centers, LLMs, AI tech to reduce costs and improve customer experience.\nIn this article, we will discuss the top 10 holdings of this new AI ETF and see whether they have the potential to rise in the coming months and weeks. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 293\nMicrosoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the biggest holding of the KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), accounting for about 8.6% of the total assets.\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill recently chose Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) as his top enterprise AI pick. While talking to CNBC, the analyst said Microsoft is in \u201cgreat shape\u201d with its \u201cCopilot strategy\u201d for the back half of 2024.\nDan Ives of Wedbush also believes MSFT is one of the leaders in the AI enterprise segment.\nNew Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \u201clow teens for years to come\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The\u00a0 stock\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cThe Strategy trailed the Russell 3000 Index benchmark largely due to our diversified positioning, although we maintain a considerable portfolio allocation to large cap AI-related companies. These positions were indeed among our top contributors in the quarter, such as\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT). The company is finding more ways to deploy AI for sustainability objectives such as its ability to better measure, predict and optimize complex systems, which can help its partner communities reduce wildfire risk.\u201d\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Insiders At Microsoft Sold US$82m In Stock, Alluding To Potential Weakness",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "In the last year, many Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nThe President & Vice Chairman, Bradford Smith, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$20m worth of shares at a price of US$412 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$459. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 8.7% of Bradford Smith's holding.\nMicrosoft insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Microsoft. In total, Executive VP & Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff sold US$11m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Microsoft insiders own about US$1.1b worth of shares (which is 0.03% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\nAn insider hasn't bought Microsoft stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Microsoft makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. For example - Microsoft has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If you buy and hold a quality stock for the long term, you expect to earn a good return. But often, I see investors dismiss valuations because the argument is that everything will sort itself out in the long run -- and that can be a dangerous assumption.\nIf you buy a stock at a high valuation, it can be difficult to earn a good return. And in some cases, you could even face the risk of a sell-off due to that heightened valuation.\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is a great example of this, because it might surprise you to learn that holding the stock for more than 20 years has actually been a worse move than owning it over a much shorter time frame.\nWhile long-term investors have made out well from owning the stock, those who prioritized valuation and bought the stock at a more reasonable multiple made out much better than those who didn't.\nMicrosoft has been a top technology stock for decades. But even good stocks can become overvalued. Here's a look at Microsoft's price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple back in the first few months of 2000, right before the big dot-com crash.\nAt the start of 2000, it was trading at more than 70 times earnings. The danger with paying a high price for a stock is that it can take a long time for the underlying financials to catch up since that inflated valuation has a lot of future earnings already baked into that price. You're effectively paying for growth the company hasn't achieved yet.\nToday, Microsoft isn't anywhere near those inflated multiples, but it's still not cheap, either, trading at more than 40 times its trailing earnings.\nFor investors who bought at the start of 2000 and who ignored the stock's extremely high valuation, they endured a costly dot-com crash. Here's a look at what a $10,000 investment in Microsoft's stock back in 2000 would be worth today.\nYou see a bit of a dip in the price. And in the end, you would see your investment grow to around eight times its value by today. You still end up with a great return by holding on for the long run.\nBut now, consider what your returns would be if you invested in the stock in 2016, when Microsoft was trading at a P/E of around 39.\nYour investment would actually be worth more now versus the investor who bought shares back in 2000 and incurred a big decline. While looking back over 20 years, it looks like nothing more than an insignificant blip in the stock's overall performance, it did have a significant adverse effect on the stock's overall gains.\nThere are different norms for different industries when it comes to earnings multiples. In tech, investors are accustomed to paying more than the 10 to 15 times earnings they might pay for bank stocks or consumer goods stocks.\nBut that doesn't mean that paying an obscene multiple is always justifiable and likely to lead to a good return as long as you hang on long enough. Microsoft is a good stock, but paying an egregious multiple for the stock in 2000 proved to be a costly mistake for investors.\nEven today, at 40 times earnings, it's a bit pricey since a lot depends on how it grows its business as it focuses on artificial intelligence. But it's still nowhere near the incredibly high price it was at in early 2000.\nWhile you shouldn't necessarily try to time the market, it's important to always consider valuations. There are many good growth stocks to choose from, and by factoring in valuations, you can find the best ones to buy. Today, Microsoft is still a good buy for the long term because it has new opportunities to pursue, but there could also be better-priced options to consider.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adrian Volenik ",
        "Text": "Steve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft, was one of Bill Gates\u2019 early hires, joining the company in 1980 as its 30th employee. After dropping out of Stanford Business School, he joined as an assistant to the president, serving more as a business manager than a PA to the owner and CEO, Bill Gates.\nDon't Miss:\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nMiami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city before that happens.\nIn Microsoft\u2019s early days, Ballmer led the sales and operations teams, and his share of the profits quickly grew as the company took off because he worked out a deal where he would earn a $50,000 base salary plus 10% of any profit growth he generated.\nThe profit-sharing deal quickly became too much for Microsoft, so Ballmer traded it for company shares. He negotiated an 8% stake for himself, while Bill Gates and Paul Allen kept 84%, and another 8% was set aside for other employees. Fortune reports that although Allen didn\u2019t want to give Ballmer such a large share, Gates stepped in and agreed to reduce his own holdings to accommodate Ballmer\u2019s 8%. When he became CEO in 2000, his Microsoft shares were worth nearly $2 billion.\nAlthough he arguably wasn\u2019t the one who was the most responsible for spearheading Microsoft into the powerhouse it is today, Ballmer\u2019s energetic and sometimes unconventional leadership style left a lasting imprint on the company, contributing to its dynamic corporate culture and innovative drive.\n\nTrending: Will the surge continue or decline on real estate prices? People are finding out about risk-free real estate investing with just $100\nAccording to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, his net worth has recently jumped to $158 billion, surpassing Bill Gates, who has $157 billion, and making Ballmer the sixth-richest person globally, surpassing industry titans like Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, and Sergey Brin.\nMost of Ballmer's wealth \u2014 over 90% \u2014 comes from his many Microsoft shares. When he left the company in 2014, he owned nearly 333 million shares, about 4% of the company. According to reports, he received $1 billion in dividends from Microsoft in 2024 alone. He also bought the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion.\nSteve Ballmer\u2019s wealth has increased significantly recently because of big advances in artificial intelligence that have boosted Microsoft\u2019s stock price. Microsoft has been investing heavily in AI, especially with companies like OpenAI, and this has caused its stock to go up by about 36% since July 2023. In 2023 alone, Ballmer\u2019s net worth increased by $30 billion because of these AI advancements.\nBill Gates, on the other hand, has diversified his investments. Now worth $157 billion, Gates has invested significantly in Cascade Investment, which he created using profits from selling Microsoft stock and dividends. Gates also has a $21 billion stake in Republic Services Inc., a waste-management company, through Cascade.\nSteve Ballmer is one of the 26 billionaires in the U.S. who made their fortunes by climbing the corporate ladder.

        "Title": "1 Phenomenal Stock That Could Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) are having a dramatic impact on the technology landscape, which is evident in the market value of some of the world's most technologically advanced businesses. What many of these companies have in common is that they're trailblazers in AI.\nApple is currently the leader (as of this writing), with Microsoft currently at No. 2, with market caps of $3.4 trillion and $3.3 trillion, respectively. Nvidia's ascent has been breathtaking, adding nearly $2 trillion in value over the past year and climbing to $2.9 trillion to take the No. 3 spot. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- all at the forefront of the AI revolution -- boast market caps of $2.2 trillion, $1.9 trillion, and $1.2 trillion, respectively.\nWith a market cap of just $387 billion, it might seem like a longshot to suggest that Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) might be in the running for membership in the $1 trillion club. However, an examination of the company's recent results and commentary from management suggests the adoption of generative AI could push the company to new heights over the next few years.\nOracle is in an enviable place in the AI revolution. It offers cloud, database, and enterprise-software solutions that are relied upon by 98% of the global Fortune 500 companies. Oracle's information technology (IT) expertise makes it one of the go-to sources for enterprises looking to adopt generative AI solutions.\nThis has helped fuel solid overall growth. During Oracle's fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended May 31), revenue of $14.3 billion grew 3% year over year, while operating income jumped 15% -- but that doesn't tell the whole story.\nDuring the Q4 earnings call, Chairman and Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison noted that the company had inked more than 30 AI-centric contracts worth more than $12 billion in the most recent quarter alone. This included some of the largest contracts in Oracle's history. Ellison said he expects robust demand for generative AI to \"turbocharge\" the company's cloud database growth.\nThis, in turn, pushed the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- or contracts not yet recognized as revenue -- to $98 billion, up 44% year over year. When RPO is growing faster than revenue, this suggests sales growth is accelerating. This helps to illustrate that Oracle is capitalizing on the growing demand for AI among its sizable customer base.\nOracle's long track record of cloud and AI experience has many new and existing enterprise clients jumping on the generative AI bandwagon, looking to benefit from the increased productivity resulting from AI adoption. That said, fortune favors the patient, as this process will take some time to come to fruition.\nAccording to Wall Street, Oracle is expected to generate revenue of $57.9 billion in its fiscal 2025 (which began June 1), giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 7. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Oracle would need to grow its revenue to approximately $148 billion annually to support a $1 trillion market cap.\nRevenue grew by 11% year over year in the most recent quarter and is expected to accelerate to 15% for the fiscal year. If the company achieves 11% sales growth, Oracle could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2034. However, if the company can maintain a growth rate of 15%, it would knock a couple of years off that timeline, reaching a $1 trillion market cap by 2032.\nThat said, estimates regarding the impact of generative AI adoption continue to ratchet higher. Conservative estimates suggest the market could grow to between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\nIf Oracle continues to successfully tap into this AI opportunity and proceeds along its current growth trajectory, the company could achieve a $1 trillion market cap sooner than many expect.\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Oracle wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Why Microsoft (MSFT) is Poised to Beat Earnings Estimates Again",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Microsoft (MSFT), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Software industry.\nThis software maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5.39%.\nFor the most recent quarter, Microsoft was expected to post earnings of $2.81 per share, but it reported $2.94 per share instead, representing a surprise of 4.63%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.76 per share, while it actually produced $2.93 per share, a surprise of 6.16%.\nFor Microsoft, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nMicrosoft currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.08%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on July 30, 2024.\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Lip said that he\u2019s still bullish on tech stocks and a single event does not show a trend.

        "Title": "Microsoft (MSFT) Strikes Deal With Cloud Lobby, Dodges EU Probe",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Microsoft MSFT has successfully navigated away from a potentially lengthy European Union (EU) antitrust investigation into its cloud business practices. The tech giant reached an agreement with the Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), an Amazon AMZN-backed trade association that had previously raised concerns about Microsoft's software licensing agreements.The deal will result in CISPE withdrawing its complaint to the EU's competition department. CISPE had alleged that Microsoft was making it challenging for customers to switch cloud providers by tying its business software to its Azure cloud services. This practice, according to the lobby group, was hindering fair competition in the European cloud market.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has not only addressed past concerns but also collaborated with CISPE to create a framework for increased competition in the cloud computing sector across Europe and beyond. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The agreement allows CISPE members to access enhanced Microsoft Azure features and permits service providers to offer Microsoft applications and services on their local cloud infrastructures.This latest development demonstrates Microsoft's efforts to navigate the complex regulatory landscape in Europe, reminiscent of its past battles with EU regulators over Windows' market dominance.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe agreement marks the end of a protracted dispute between Microsoft and CISPE, during which MSFT made several concessions to address the concerns of cloud service providers. This development comes at a time when EU regulators had been informally probing market competitors and customers about Microsoft's business practices.Despite this resolution, Microsoft continues to face scrutiny on other fronts. The company's $13 billion investment in OpenAI Inc. is currently under informal investigation by EU regulators due to concerns about the AI firm's exclusive use of MSFT's cloud technology. Microsoft has given up its board observer seat at OpenAI in a move aimed at easing U.S. and U.K. antitrust regulators' concerns about the extent of its control over the AI startup amid the soaring popularity of generative AI.Last week, the company agreed to a $14.4 million settlement with California's Civil Rights Department over allegations of discrimination against employees on parental and disability leave. (Read More: Microsoft Settles Discrimination Lawsuit in California)Additionally, in June, the EU accused Microsoft of abusing its market power by bundling the Teams video-conferencing app with its other business software. (Read More: Microsoft Faces Charges by EU for Bundling Teams, Office)As the tech industry continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how this agreement will shape the competitive dynamics of the European cloud market and whether it will fully address the concerns raised by other major players in the industry.While the European Commission has stated it will evaluate the settlement's impact on competition in European cloud markets, the deal has not been extended to some major players in the industry. CISPE confirmed that Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d), Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google Cloud Platform and Alibaba BABA cloud service were not included in the agreement. This exclusion has drawn criticism from these companies, with AWS asserting that the settlement fails to address the needs of the majority of Microsoft customers, who still face restrictions in choosing their preferred cloud provider.Shares of MSFT have gained 24% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Amazon and Alphabet\u2019s growth of 29.4%, 31.5% and 36.9%, respectively.As tech giants expand and innovate, they encounter mounting pressure to uphold fair competition, safeguard user rights and foster equitable workplaces. The resolutions of ongoing legal challenges could establish crucial precedents, potentially transforming how these companies function and engage with their workforce, clientele and rivals in the evolving tech landscape.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Attiya Zainib ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of the 10 Best Stock Picks of Billionaire Leon Cooperman in 2024.\u00a0Since Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0Leon Cooperman\u00a0predicted in April that the US is headed for a financial crisis. Cooperman said that the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero, but raised them dramatically in a period of 12 months. The \u00a0Omega Family Office chairman and CEO expects \u201cone or two\u201d rate cuts this year. He emphasized that the market remains overvalued.\nIn February last year, the billionaire said that the market was headed for a recession, and noted that the S&P 500 high of about 4,800 recorded in 2022 could \u201cstand for some time.\u201d In July 2022, while talking to\u00a0Bloomberg, Cooperman said that he was \u201cshocked\u201d that interest rates were so low.\n\u201cI am of the view that equities are the best house in the financial asset in the neighborhood, but I don\u2019t like the neighborhood, for a lot of reasons.\u201d\nCooperman in the Bloomberg interview in 2022 had categorically said that sooner or later the strong dollar, prices of oil and the Fed would \u201clead us into a recession.\u201d He went on to add that recession would be a \u201c2023 event\u201d and predicted that the market would bottom somewhere near 35% to 45% below its peak of 4800.\nThe billionaire had said that he would be \u201cvery surprised\u201d if we were to see another bull market anytime soon, given his view that we\u2019ve had one of the biggest bull runs driven by FAANG, SPACs and speculation. The AI revolution that started in 2023 was indeed a shocker for Cooperman as his recession predictions were proven wrong.\nFor this article we scanned billionaire Leon Cooperman\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nKen Wolter / Shutterstock.com\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\nWhile Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the ninth biggest holding of Leon Cooperman, the stock tops our list of the best stocks in Leon Cooperman\u2019s portfolio based on hedge fund sentiment. A total of 302 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Cooperman\u2019s stake in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is valued at $103 million.\nNew Street Research started covering the stock with a Buy rating. The firm said that Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is well positioned to grow profit in the \u201clow teens for years to come\u201d even if the AI revolution fails to pan out. New Street Research has a $570 price target on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\nAnalysts believe Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI ecosystem around its products would strengthen its Cloud division thanks to Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) integration of AI into its Cloud products. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Intelligent Cloud segment\u2019s profit in the latest quarter totaled $12.51 billion, a whopping 32% growth on a YoY basis.\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT)\u00a0huge investments to revive its Search business are also working. Bing\u2019s market share has jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, a 0.88 points gain on a YoY basis.\nWall Street expects Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) earnings to grow 12.50% next year. The\u00a0 stock\u2019s forward P/E of 31 based on 2025 EPS makes it look attractive at the current levels. Average analyst estimate for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is $483, which presents a 14% upside potential from the current levels.\nVulcan Value Partners\u00a0appreciated Microsoft Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) execution in its Q1 2024 investor letter.\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the firm said:\n\u201cMicrosoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world\u2019s largest software company with a broad range of offerings including Microsoft office, gaming, Azure cloud computing, LinkedIn, and more. It was a material contributor for the second consecutive quarter, and we discussed it at length in last quarter\u2019s letter. The company continues to execute well.\u201d\nOverall, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled 10 Best Stock Picks of Billionaire Leon Cooperman in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Sheraz Mian ",
        "Text": "Monday, July 15, 2024The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features a real-time update on the Q2 earnings season and new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), as well as a micro-cap stock Tile Shop Holdings, Inc. (TTSH). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard \nIncluding this morning's reports from Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, we now have Q2 results from 29 S&P 500 members. Total earnings for these companies that have reported are up +12.8% from the same period last year on +6.4% higher revenues, with 82.8% beating EPS estimates and only 44.8% beating revenue estimates. \nThe one notable feature of this admittedly small and Finance-heavy sample of results is the very small proportion of the companies that are able to beat revenue estimates. The 44.8% revenue beats percentage compares to 69% for the same group of 29 S&P 500 members in the preceding quarter (2024 Q1) and is a low for the preceding 20 quarters. \nWe will be watching closely how the revenue beats percentage unfolds in the days ahead as we move into the heart of the Q2 earnings season. \nFor the Finance sector, we now have Q2 results from 20.6% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total Q2 earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +8.1% from the same period last year on +11.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates and 83.3% beating revenue estimates. \nThe Finance sector's EPS and revenue beats percentages are tracking above the 20-quarter averages for this group of sector companies. \nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total earnings are expected to be up +8.4% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. \nToday's Featured Analyst Reports\nMicrosoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+31.2% vs. +25.9%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.\u00a0Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth.\u00a0However, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Eli Lilly have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the year-to-date period (+62.7% vs. +24.2%). The company boasts a solid portfolio of core drugs for diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Its revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance, Taltz and others. Its new tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and obesity medicine, Zepbound, are seeing exceptionally strong demand trends.\u00a0Lilly has also launched some other new products like Omvoh and Jaypirca. Mounjaro, Zepbound and other new products are expected to drive Lilly\u2019s top line in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s.\u00a0However, generic competition for some drugs, rising pricing pressure and challenges in meeting strong demand for incretin products like Zepbound and Mounjaro are some top-line headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)UnitedHealth shares were in line with the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry over the past year (+5.6% vs. +5.5%). The company\u2019s top line remains poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings. UnitedHealth\u2019s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits.\u00a0The Government business remains well-poised for growth in the future. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $27.5-$28.00 band in 2024, higher than the 2023 reported figure of $25.12. A sturdy balance sheet enables business investments and prudent deployment of capital via share repurchases and dividend payments. In June 2024, management approved a 11.7% hike in the quarterly dividend.\u00a0However, membership in its global business continues to be a concern. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>>)Shares of Tile Shop have outperformed the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry over the past year (+17.4% vs. +10.4%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $320.59 million has a strong financial health, with zero long-term debt and $24 million in cash as of first-quarter 2024. This positions the company to invest in growth and weather economic fluctuations.\u00a0Gross margins improved to 65.8% due to lower freight and product costs, reflecting effective cost management. Expansion of product lines, including new luxury vinyl tile (LVT) lines, enhances revenue diversification. E-commerce sales growth reflects a strategic shift to capture online markets. Effective cost management led to a 5.5% decline in SG&A expenses.\u00a0Yet, challenges include a 10.2% fall in comparable store sales, weak macroeconomic conditions, high SG&A expenses, inventory management issues and potential margin pressures. Dependence on professional customers, stiff competition and limited store footprint growth are other concerns.(You can read the full research report on Tile Shop here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Infosys Limited (INFY) and McKesson Corporation (MCK).Director of ResearchSheraz MianNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "Text": "The world's largest software maker \u2014 Microsoft MSFT \u2014 disappointed investors with its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 results, which deepened fears about the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Though the company beat earnings and revenue estimates, growth in Azure cloud computing slowed down. Also, Microsoft offered weak guidance for the ongoing quarter (see: all the Technology ETFs here).The stock lost about 3% in after-market hours, paring earlier losses of as much as 9.1%. ETFs having double-digit exposure to this software leader also plummeted in extended trading. Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT and iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF IYW dipped at least 1% each. iShares Global Tech ETF IXN was up 0.2%.\nEarnings per share came in at $2.95, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.90 and were higher than $2.69 reported a year ago quarter. Revenues grew 15% year over year to $64.7 billion, edging past the consensus estimate of $64.73 billion.Intelligent Cloud revenues jumped 19% year over year to $28.5 billion. Sales of Office 365 Commercial and Dynamic 365 climbed 13% and 19%, respectively. Sales of the flagship Azure computing platform grew 29% year over year, down from 31% in the previous quarter.The software maker has been infusing its product line with AI technology from partner OpenAI, including digital assistants called Copilots that can summarize documents and generate computer code, emails and other content. The company also is selling Azure cloud subscriptions featuring OpenAI products. Further, Microsoft is spending billions to construct new data centers to meet demand for cloud computing and power-hungry AI services.\u00a0Though Azure growth will continue to slow down in the current quarter, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said that investments in data centers and servers will let the company capitalize on demand and accelerate Azure growth in the second half of fiscal 2025.Microsoft expects revenues of $63.8-$64.8 billion for the fiscal first quarter of 2025, implying 13.8% growth at the middle of the range. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $65.16 billion.\nSelect Sector SPDR Technology ETF (XLK)Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF is the most popular and liquid ETF in the technology space, with AUM of $67.2 billion and an average daily volume of 5 million shares. It offers broad exposure to the technology sector and follows the Technology Select Sector Index. Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF holds about 67 securities in its basket, with Microsoft occupying the top position at 22.3% (read: Should You Buy the Dip in \"Mag 7\" and Big Tech ETFs?).Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF charges 9 bps in fees per year from investors and has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.MSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC)MSCI Information Technology Index ETF is home to 297 technology stocks with AUM of $11.3 billion.

        "Text": "Tech majors Microsoft and Apple are dropping out of their respective seats on the Board of Directors of AI startup OpenAI, the developer of generative chatbot ChatGPT, amid increasing regulatory scrutiny in Europe and the US over generative AI, according to reports.\nMicrosoft, OpenAI's largest investor, has quit as an observer on OpenAI's nonprofit board, a non-voting seat which it took in November last year.\nMicrosoft's Deputy General Counsel Keith Dolliver, in a letter to OpenAI, said the seat was no longer needed as the company had witnessed significant progress from the newly formed board.\nFurther, Apple, which was planning to join the Board following its recent AI development deal, is said to be no longer taking its board seat.\nAt the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, Apple announced its partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into iOS 18.\nAs part of the collaboration, Phil Schiller, the former marketing head and chief of the App Store at Apple, was selected to have an observer role on OpenAI's board, and was expected to join later this year.\nConfirming that Microsoft has given up its seat, OpenAI spokesperson Steve Sharpe reportedly said, \"We're grateful to Microsoft for voicing confidence in the Board and the direction of the company, and we look forward to continuing our successful partnership.\"\n\"Under the leadership of CFO Sarah Friar, we are establishing a new approach to informing and engaging key strategic partners - such as Microsoft and Apple - and investors - such as Thrive Capital and Khosla Ventures.\"\nThe new approach by OpenAI is said to involve regular stakeholder meetings with Microsoft and Apple to share progress on its mission and ensure stronger collaboration across safety and security.\nMicrosoft took the non-voting board seat at OpenAI during the troubling period of the startup last year, when its co-founder Sam Altman was ousted from the Board and as CEO after alleging that he was not consistently candid in his communications.\nAltman rejoined as CEO few days later, and also to the board after an independent Special Committee investigation found that his conduct did not mandate removal.\nThe news comes as the European Commission recently said Microsoft could face an antitrust investigation as the regulator was looking into some of the deals between large digital market players and generative AI developers and providers to find the impact of these partnerships on market dynamics.\nThe Commission in January said it was checking whether Microsoft's investment in OpenAI might be reviewable under the EU Merger Regulation.\n"

        "Author": "  Kurt Robson ",
        "Text": "A global IT outage has affected major services including banks, airlines, healthcare and broadcasters. The massive shutdown is understood to have been caused by technology giant Microsoft and cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.\nMicrosoft said on Friday (19 July) that it was looking into the \u201cdegraded state\u201d of its 365 applications that are having a \u201clingering impact\u201d on infrastructure, while CrowdStrike confirmed it was aware of the outages.\nIn a popular Reddit thread, tens of hundreds of IT admins are posting about widespread issues in different locations. The IT admins are posting a series of steps to work around the issues, including putting a Windows machine into safe mode and deleting certain system files.\nThe IT outages have affected businesses and airlines across the globe.\nMany GP surgeries and pharmacies have been unable to access patient records and delivery medicines.\nAirports including Heathrow, Luton, London Gatwick and Stansted have been suffering delays and faulty check-in services.\nAirlines including Ryanair, Delta Airlines, American Airlines and Wizzair have also been impacted by the tech outage.\nTens of train companies have suffered delays and outages, leaving passengers stranded.\nUS emergency service call operators in several states have been affected.\nBroadcasters including Sky News, Sky Sports and ABC News have been impacted, with some taking whole programmes off air.\nSeveral banks have been impacted.\nSeveral retail stores including Woolworths in Australia and UK bakery chain Gail\u2019s have been impacted.\nThe London Stock Exchange news platform was impacted.\nJake Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at ESET, said the IT outage \"highlights the importance of these services and the millions of people they serve.\n\"Businesses must test their updates and infrastructure and have multiple fail-safes in place, however large the company is.\n\"But as often it is with the case, it is simply impossible to simulate the size and magnitude of the issue in a safe environment without testing the actual network.\n\"The inconvenience caused by the loss of access to services for thousands of people serves as a reminder of our dependence on Big Tech in running our daily lives and businesses.\"\nIlkka Turunen, field CTO at Sonatype, said: \"The widespread outages across the world affecting Microsoft Windows are due to a botched update to a piece of software called Crowdstrike, a well-regarded malware and endpoint protection tool often used by enterprises and many companies across the world.\n\"In terms of technical details, the update causes a blue screen of death loop on any Windows machine essentially making it boot and crash on an infinite loop. Making it worse is the fact that there are a significant number of Windows machines that the update was auto-installed on overnight. There are workarounds that customers of theirs will apply, but it seems to be very manual.\n\"It is definitely a supply chain style incident \u2013 what it shows is that one popular vendor botching an update can have a huge impact on its customers and how far a single well-orchestrated update can spread in a single night. It is not yet clear if the contents were due to malicious reasons, but it shows how quickly targeted attacks on popular vendors could spread.\"\n\"CrowdStrike Microsoft outage: everything we know so far \" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

The company states on its website that this event is not a security incident or cyberattack, but rather is related to its Falcon Sensor software.\n\u201cThe issue has been identified, isolated and a fix has been deployed,\u201d CloudStrike states in a post on the website. \u201cWe refer customers to the support portal for the latest updates and will continue to provide complete and continuous updates on our website. We further recommend organizations ensure they\u2019re communicating with CrowdStrike representatives through official channels. Our team is fully mobilized to ensure the security and stability of CrowdStrike customers.\u201d\nThe post details symptoms of bugcheck or blue screen errors related to the Falcon Sensor. CloudStrike says Windows devices that have not been impacted do not require any action since the problematic update file has been reverted. Windows devices brought online after 1:27 a.m. EDT will also not be impacted.\nDevices running Windows 7/2008 R2 are not impacted, and the issue is not impacting Mac or Linux-based devices.\nThe post also offers troubleshooting tips for addressing the glitch. Additionally, Microsoft posted on X/Twitter that the company is aware of the incident on Windows devices. The post includes troubleshooting tips as well as a link referring to CloudStrike\u2019s statements on the matter.\nThe CrowdStrike post states its engineering team has identified an update related to the issue and has reverted those changes. For devices that are still crashing and are unable to stay online to receive the update, the following steps can be used to work around the issue:\nWorkaround steps for individual hosts:\nReboot the host to give it an opportunity to download the reverted channel file. If the host crashes again, then:\nBoot Windows into Safe Mode or the Windows Recovery Environment. (Putting the host on a wired network, as opposed to Wi-Fi, and using Safe Mode with Networking can help remediation.)\nNavigate to the %WINDIR%\\System32\\drivers\\CrowdStrike directory.\nLocate the file matching \u201cC-00000291*.sys\u201d and delete it.\nBoot the host normally.\nBitlocker-encrypted hosts may require a recovery key.\nWorkaround steps for public cloud or similar environment including virtual:\nOption 1:\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bDetach the operating system disk volume from the impacted virtual server.\nCreate a snapshot or backup of the disk volume before proceeding further as a precaution against unintended changes.\nAttach/mount the volume to to a new virtual server.\nNavigate to the %WINDIR%\\System32\\drivers\\CrowdStrike directory.\nLocate the file matching \u201cC-00000291*.sys\u201d and delete it.\nDetach the volume from the new virtual server.\nReattach the fixed volume to the impacted virtual server.\nOption 2:\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bRoll back to a snapshot before 12:09 a.m. EDT.\nIf all else fails, Microsoft offers the option to restore Windows 365 Cloud PCs to a known good state prior to the release of this update.\nThe post CloudStrike, Microsoft give updates, troubleshooting tips after IT glitch appeared first on FreightWaves.\n"

His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the \u201cvalue stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.\u201d\n\u201cWe look at the last year and a half, they\u2019ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap\u2026 just these seven companies. Just to give you perspective, the second-largest market in the world, China, has a market cap of $12.1 trillion. These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.\u201d\nDamodaran\u2019s comments are important because he\u2019s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued. In September, he said on CNBC that if you go through the list of top tech stocks, \u201cyou are more likely to be overvalued than undervalued.\u201d\nBut in his latest interview, Damodaran said that before we \u201cdismiss\u201d Mag. 7 stocks as \u201crisky tech companies,\u201d we should keep in mind that \u201cthese are the money machines in this market.\u201d\nHowever, when asked whether he believes we are not in any kind of \u201cdanger zone,\u201d the professor said we are in the danger zone not just in terms of these seven stocks, but the market overall.\nIn this article we take a look at the Mag 7. stocks and their AI-related growth catalysts. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

For Azure, Microsoft detailed previously announced partnerships with NVIDIA and AMD to develop first\u2010party silicon chips and custom\u2010 designed infrastructure innovations, including its AI accelerator (Azure Maia) and CPU (Azure Cobalt). These advancements are part of Microsoft\u2019s strategy to enhance AI performance and efficiency within the Azure ecosystem. LinkedIn, which has more than doubled its membership to over one billion in the past four years, is expanding its revenue streams across subscriptions and advertising and increasingly disrupting traditional recruiting and training functions. LinkedIn recently passed $16 billion in run rate annual revenue, which is only ~7% of total Microsoft revenue, but if it were a standalone business, it would be in the top half of S&P 500 constituents!

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks That Will Skyrocket.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other stocks.\nThe primary lure of investing, as you're likely to know, is to make money. Every day thousands of investors pour into the market to pick out what they believe will be winners to make them rich. And, the market delivers as well. This has been quite clear in 2024, with the hype surrounding artificial intelligence having delivered previously unthinkable returns. Wall Street's favorite AI stock, the chipmaker that's responsible for providing the industry with GPUs to run AI workloads, has gained a whopping 636% since ChatGPT was released in November 2022. This stock ranks 4th in our list of \u00a0Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential, so if you haven't guessed by now, then do take a look.\nLooking at these spectacular returns, one would be hard pressed to conclude that if you want to make money on the stock market, then growth is the way to go. But as is the case with most things in life, details are lurking under the hood that go against this simple supposition. On this front, professors from the University of Illinois looked at the returns of large cap and small cap value and growth stocks starting from 1969 and ending in 2001. Taking a geometric mean of these returns, they revealed that large cap growth ('glamour') stocks delivered mean returns of 4.5%, 7.9%, and 3.8% between 1969-2001, 1979-2001, and 1990-2001, respectively. On the other hand, large cap value stocks delivered returns of 16.4%, 20.4%, and 18% over the three respective time periods. What's more, is that the returns offered by the value stocks during 1969 and 2001 also surpassed the returns of the S&P 500 index which sat at 11.4%!\nBut what about small caps? After all, small caps are all the hype on Wall Street these days as investors position themselves for an interest rate cut. July 11th saw the S&P's flagship index bleed 91 basis points, with the technology heavy NASDAQ shedding 1.98%. The NASDAQ's drop was led by its 100 most valuable non financial companies which shed 2.15% during the same day. On the other hand, the rising fortunes of small cap stocks accelerated on the 11th. The leading small cap stock index gained 2% during the day and nearly matched this during the first half an hour of trading on the 12th by gaining 1.6% as it opened significantly higher after the after and pre market trading sessions.\nLooking at these gains, you might be wondering which small cap stocks might be worth their while. Well, we looked at analyst sentiment as part of our coverage of 8 Best Small-Cap Stocks Ready to Explode According to Analysts and hedge fund sentiment as part of 15 Small-Cap Stocks with High Potential so you should check them out if you're interested in small cap stocks.\nComing back to the professors' research, during 1969-2001, 1979-2001, and 1990-2001, small cap growth stocks, were down by 2.8%, 1.8%, and 6.2%, respectively. On the other hand, small cap value stocks delivered geometric mean returns of 18.3%, 22.8%, and 17.7%, respectively. Seems like over the long term, investing in value stocks appears to be just as, if not more, worthwhile while large cap growth stocks appear to fare better than their small cap. peers.\nWhile you might be thinking that these stats do not apply to the current market, it's also true that they are relevant to an extent especially since 1990 to 2001 was characterized by soaring valuations fuelled by internet stocks. Right now, AI is all that anyone can talk about, even as investors are moving out of big ticket technology names into the under appreciated small caps. Back then, the shares of a California based internet connectivity equipment provider soared by a whopping 53,207% between January 1991 and April 2000. So, this would have seen $1,000 invested during the start soar to $533,000 at the peak, which, fair to say, is life changing money for most of us. Yet, those same shares are down by 36% since then and had tumbled by as much as 79% by February 2009. If you're interested in knowing what this stock is, it ranked 8th on our list of the 10 Best Communication and Media Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.\nAt the same time, not all growth stocks end up lower. Some of the biggest examples that weathered the storm after the dotcom bubble popped are the largest companies today. They belong to the eCommerce, consumer and enterprise software, and the broader technology industries. Today's mega cap stocks have gained anywhere between 6,455% to 203,377% and 437,010% since they were listed for trading. Safe to say, these 'fads' of the time weren't fads and the market knew what it was doing.\nTheir returns are also what drive growth investors in droves to the stock market. While eCommerce and consumer technology were trends of the past, there are dozens of trends that newsletter publishers have embraced with open arms these days as they promise the next stock capable of delivering 10x or even 100x in returns. Since you're likely to be aware of AI at this point, we'll skip it out and list some other ideas. One of the biggest, and perhaps underreported ideas that newsletters have been pitching is quantum computing. Quantum computing expands the amount of data that a traditional computer can compute, and while its stocks haven't delivered strong returns yet, publishers believe that the future is bright. You can look at some quantum computing stocks and a broader industry overview by reading 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In.\nOne trend that has delivered returns is weight loss. Since March 2023, these stocks have delivered as much as 173% in returns, and with newer products such as pills under development, some folks believe that there's more room left for growth. Another highly pitched trend is energy, specifically nuclear energy, uranium miners, and energy infrastructure stocks. All these will benefit from the growth in electricity consumption from AI data centers, according to newsletter publishers.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the stocks that might skyrocket, we scanned investment newsletters from Stock Gumshoe and narrowed down 20 stocks from newsletters dated back as far as June 13th. These were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024 and the top ten stocks were chosen. Stock Gumshoe's thesis and the date of each newsletter are also mentioned.\nWe also mentioned the number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks during the same filing period. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors\u00a0 in Q1 2024: 293\nDate of Newsletter: July 9th\nComing back to Navellier, this stock had a \"cash flow of $9.1 billion\" in Q4 2023 which puts it on track to become the \"largest company in the world for at least the next 10 years.\" Safe to say, this isn't a small cap stock or a startup. Some hints about its business model include the firm's operations in \"cloud computing, cybersecurity, software, gaming, hardware, search,\" and we'll make it easy for you by sharing that it isn't Google parent Alphabet. If you're an avid follower of the technology industry, you should have guessed it by now, but if you haven't, then Navellier reminds you that this stock can provide the \"perfect mix of stability and low risk.\"\nThis stock is the mega cap technology giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Navellier's latest stocks are all about QaaS, and Gumshoe also notes that two of China's largest technology conglomerates, Alibaba and Baidu have both given up on their quantum investments lately. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s forward P/E of 36x does make it expensive, and investing in an S&P linked fund could provide exposure to its stock coupled with other tech heavy weights.\nOverall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the stocks that will skyrocket. You can visit 10 Stocks That Will Skyrocket to see the other stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Ryan Vlastelica and Subrat Patnaik ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. investors will be hoping it can do a better job than Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. in convincing Wall Street that lofty spending on artificial intelligence will be worth it.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSinger Akon\u2019s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice\nWhat a Beautiful Bus Stop Can Do\nValencia Follows Barcelona in Crackdown on Short-Term Rentals\nA Vast Wetland Park Seeks to Slake a Thirsty Megacity\nA Radical Fix for Britain\u2019s Housing Crisis: A New Offshore City\nWall Street is taking a more skeptical view of how much is being spent on AI by tech firms and when it will start to pay off in terms of improved growth and profitability. The Facebook parent already irked investors in April by hiking its spending forecast above estimates. Microsoft shares slid 1% on Wednesday after it reported slower growth in its cloud computing unit and said capital expenditures would increase again in the next fiscal year.\n\u201cThe key question is whether Meta takes capex up even more,\u201d said Denny Fish, who manages the $7.2 billion Janus Henderson Global Technology and Innovation Fund. \u201cThe demand environment is pretty good, revenue trends have been strong, and the valuation is still reasonable. However, it sold off last quarter, when things were pretty pristine except for capex, which shows you how much investors are concerned about this.\u201d\nMeta, which reports on Wednesday after the close, has already shown some growth uplift from AI as the technology helps improve ad targeting on its social media products. It\u2019s also adding new AI features to WhatsApp, including an AI assistant that can help businesses connect with customers, answer questions, and sell their goods and services via chat. Shares rose as much as 2.8% in intraday trading ahead of the report.\nBut investors may have less patience with Meta than other Big Tech names. The shares suffered two post-earnings blowups in 2022 as Meta stuck to its guns on its metaverse strategy, sinking billions of dollars into an unpopular virtual-reality vision. It turned that around in 2023 by proclaiming a year of efficiency marked by heavy cost cuts, and pleased Wall Street in January with a $50 billion buyback and its first-ever quarterly dividend.\nThe shares are up 31% this year, outperforming peers in part because of Meta\u2019s relatively cheap valuation. Meta trades at about 21 times projected profits, well below the Nasdaq 100\u2019s multiple of 25 times. Still, the stock has fallen recently amid a broader rotation out of the sector, and a misstep on spending could extend the selloff. Options data indicates an implied one-day move of about 8.8% \u2014 in either direction \u2014 after the results.\nAnalysts are expecting Meta to report $9.5 billion in capital expenditures this quarter, up around 50% from the year-ago period, while full-year capex is seen coming in at almost $38 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net earnings per share are expected to grow 59% this quarter, and revenue is forecast to rise about 20%.\nResults from other Magnificent Seven companies have highlighted the importance of capex numbers \u2014 and the need for firms to conclusively beat expectations. Alphabet shares dropped last week after the Google parent sunk more resources into AI, fueling higher spending than analysts expected.\nOf course, the focus of any spending may be as important as the amount. Bank of America analyst Justin Post wrote in a note that cost cuts in Meta\u2019s augmented reality and virtual reality initiatives could \u201cmaterially boost\u201d investor sentiment, even if the savings are redirected toward spending on AI.\n\u201cWhile investors have been constructive on AI investment spending and opportunity, we think there is little investor support for the magnitude of Reality Labs spending,\u201d Post wrote, referring to the business division that includes the metaverse.\nMeta\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged concerns about spending in a recent interview on the Bloomberg Originals series The Circuit with Emily Chang.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a meaningful chance that a lot of the companies are over-building now, and that you\u2019ll look back and you\u2019re like, \u2018oh, we maybe all spent some number of billions of dollars more than we had to,\u2019\u201d he said. Still, over-spending is rational, he said, \u201cbecause the downside of being behind is that you\u2019re out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years.\u201d\nTop Tech Stories\nMicrosoft Corp.\u2019s Azure cloud-computing service posted a slowdown in quarterly growth, disappointing investors anxious to see a payoff from huge investments in AI.\nAdvanced Micro Devices Inc. shares rallied after the chipmaker gave an upbeat revenue forecast, underscoring that its new AI processors are boosting growth.\nSamsung Electronics Co. reported its fastest pace of net income growth since 2010 and said it plans to double output of the high-end chips fueling the artificial intelligence boom next year.\nThe US is preparing to exclude semiconductor-equipment makers in the Netherlands and Japan from its latest round of restrictions targeting China, people familiar with the situation said, while warning the plans are fluid and may change.

        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.95 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.90 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.69 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.72%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this software maker would post earnings of $2.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.94, delivering a surprise of 4.63%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\nMicrosoft , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Software industry, posted revenues of $64.73 billion for the quarter ended June 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.84%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $56.19 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\nMicrosoft shares have added about 13.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 14.5%.\nWhat's Next for Microsoft?\nWhile Microsoft has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Microsoft: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.14 on $65.16 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $13.17 on $278.25 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Software is currently in the bottom 41% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\nAnother stock from the same industry, Smith Micro Software, Inc. (SMSI), has yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2024. The results are expected to be released on August 1.\nThis company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -337.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\nSmith Micro Software, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $5.4 million, down 47.8% from the year-ago quarter.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Quarterly results from Microsoft MSFT\u00a0will be a highlight of this week\u2019s earnings lineup as investors continue to gauge how big tech companies are fairing amid easing inflation.\nReporting its fiscal fourth quarter results after market hours on Tuesday, July 30, let\u2019s see if it's time to buy Microsoft\u2019s stock.\nMicrosoft's Q4 Expectations \nLed by Azure, Microsoft\u2019s growth has been fueled by its cloud services with Q4 sales expected to rise 14% to $64.19 billion versus $56.19 billion in the comparative quarter. \u00a0\nAs a cloud computing platform, Azure has continued to take market share by gaining an edge with customers looking to build their own AI solutions. Strengthening Microsoft\u2019s artificial intelligence offerings has been its strategic partnership with ChapGPT creator OpenAI. In addition to this, chips from AMD AMD\u00a0and its magnificent seven peer Nvidia NVDA\u00a0have further diversified Microsoft\u2019s AI accelerators.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Q4 EPS is thought to have increased 8% to $2.90 compared to $2.69 per share a year ago. Furthermore, Microsoft has surpassed bottom-line expectations for seven consecutive quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 7.38% in its last four quarterly reports.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nYTD Performance\nYear to date, Microsoft's stock is up a respectable +13% which has slightly trailed the broader indexes and most of its magnificent seven peers including Nvidia. Still, this performance has been roughly on par with Apple AAPL\u00a0and has topped Tesla\u2019s TSLA\u00a0-7%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMonitoring Microsoft\u2019s Valuation\nAt current levels, Microsoft's stock trades at 32.2X forward earnings and at a premium to the S&P 500\u2019s 22.9X but beneath its Zacks Computer-Software industry average of 35.1X.\nMicrosoft also trades beneath its decade-long high of 38.2X forward earnings but above the median of 26.3X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nAhead of its Q4 report, Microsoft\u2019s stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Reaching or exceeding quarterly expectations may be crucial to more upside in Microsoft\u2019s stock as its valuation does allude to the notion that there could be better buying opportunities ahead.

        "Text": "Let's talk about the popular Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$468 and falling to the lows of US$389. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Microsoft's current trading price of US$418 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Microsoft\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.\n View our latest analysis for Microsoft \nAccording to our valuation model, Microsoft seems to be fairly priced at around 15% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microsoft today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $492.59, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. In addition to this, Microsoft has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 53% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Microsoft. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? MSFT\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on MSFT, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nSo if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is up by 7.2% over the past three months. Given its impressive performance, we decided to study the company's key financial indicators as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Microsoft's  ROE.\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft \nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Microsoft is:\n34% = US$86b \u00f7 US$253b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.34 in profit.\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nTo begin with, Microsoft has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 12% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 16% net income growth seen by Microsoft over the past five years.\nNext, on comparing Microsoft's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 13% over the last few years.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is MSFT worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether MSFT is currently mispriced by the market.\nMicrosoft has a three-year median payout ratio of 27%, which implies that it retains the remaining 73% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.\nAdditionally, Microsoft has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 22% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Microsoft's future ROE will be 29% which is again, similar to the current ROE.\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Microsoft's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "Author": "  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The PC market got a shakeup last month when Microsoft threw its weight behind Qualcomm and its new Arm-based CPUs to sell the idea of the artificial intelligence (AI) PC to consumers. Microsoft's own Surface devices, as well as an array of laptops from the major PC OEMs, are powered by the new chips.\nAt the moment, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X processors are the only PC CPUs available with enough AI horsepower to meet Microsoft's Copilot+ PC requirement. Systems must have a neural processing unit, or NPU, capable of at least 40 trillion operations per second, as well as 16 gigabytes of RAM.\nCopilot+ PCs gain support for a handful of AI-powered features, including a text-to-image tool in Paint, filters for webcams, and live captions with translations. Recall, a feature that takes screenshots of activity to allow users to find anything they've seen on their PC, was delayed due to privacy and security concerns.\nWhile Microsoft offering exclusive AI-powered Windows features on laptops with Qualcomm chips may seem like bad news for CPU market leader Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), it's unlikely to matter much in the long run. Reviews for the AI features in Windows that are currently available have been abysmal.\nTom's Hardware ran through the available features and concluded that \"they aren't that impressive and you can get them elsewhere.\" The Cocreator tool for Paint doesn't work very well and still requires an internet connection despite using the on-board NPU, the webcam features like background blurring are already common features in videoconferencing apps, and the live captions feature won't be useful for most users.\nRecall has the potential to be useful, but it's not ready yet, and the clock is ticking on Qualcomm's Copilot+ exclusivity. AMD is launching its Ryzen AI chips later this month, which will have ample AI processing power, and Intel will roll out its Lunar Lake chips later this year.\nWhile laptops powered by Qualcomm's chips have some appealing qualities, including solid performance and long battery lives, the AI features built into Windows appear to be mostly gimmicks right now. This will likely change as on-device AI processors become more capable, but that process will play out over years.\nIntel missing out on having Copilot+ PCs available probably won't matter much. The company's Meteor Lake chips, which launched late last year, feature an NPU that isn't powerful enough to meet Microsoft's requirements. Lunar Lake will surpass those requirements, and it will likely launch well before the AI features built into Windows become a real selling point.\nAI will eventually change how people use PCs, unlocking new levels of productivity and enabling new experiences. But that day has not yet arrived. By the time it does, both Intel and AMD will have powerful AI-enabled CPUs on the market.\nWhile Intel will have to contend with a more competitive PC CPU market in the coming years, Microsoft's AI snub won't give Qualcomm an advantage over the market leader.\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Intel wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Allie Garfinkle ",
        "Text": "When most people talk about hurricanes, they talk about the storm itself\u2014the dark, swirling experience of watching trees fall from the right side of a glass hurricane window.\nBut I\u2019m from Florida and I\u2019m here to tell you: The hurricane doesn\u2019t end when the storm ends\u2014it ends when the power and gas comes back on. When I was a kid, latency was part of that process. My siblings and I would play Candy Land in the sweaty Miami dark, while utilities providers and companies scrambled to figure out who needed help.\nWhat do my childhood Candy Land games have to do with startups and venture capital? Well, power outages are still a problem (perhaps more so as warming oceans fuel more hurricanes), and solutions to problems are what the startup game is all about.\nDan Wright, the cofounder and CEO of Armada, believes that extreme situations like hurricanes reinforce the need for \u201cedge\u201d computing, the practice of processing data locally rather than sending it back to the cloud. \u201cLots of oil and gas companies are really very concerned about these types of disasters,\u201d Wright says. \u201cYou can't have any latency. You have to be able to respond in real time.\"\nDisaster response is the obvious application, but Wright and the Armada crew believe edge technology also has a big role to play in all sorts of remote environments where uninterrupted data access is critical. Think real-time safety monitoring at high-risk worksites, real-time emissions tracking for oil rigs, and automated operations for mines. The company collaborates with Starlink and has recently launched partnerships with companies like Halliburton and Skydio.\nArmada came out of stealth in 2023 and has so far raised $100 million, having just announced its Series A in December. And now, Fortune can exclusively report, it has scored another $40 million from Microsoft\u2019s venture fund, M12. Along with the funding, Armada\u2019s products will become available in Microsoft Azure\u2019s marketplace.\nIt\u2019s a natural fit, says Pradeep Nair, Armada\u2019s founding CTO and a 10-year veteran of Microsoft\u2019s Azure business. \u201cIf you look at all of these customers we\u2019re hitting\u2014oil, gas, and mining\u2014these guys are legacy, traditional customers and Microsoft is their biggest vendor,\u201d he says. The partnership with Microsoft \u201copens up the whole pipeline, without us needing to go through the whole procurement process.\u201d\nThe company declined to disclose any metrics or the number of current customers. A source familiar with the matter said that the company\u2019s valuation jumped with this extension. Still, it\u2019s a rare thing right now to see investors dazzled by a young company that\u2019s not expressly an AI startup. Sure, Armada\u2019s deploying AI, but it\u2019s not the point. So, what\u2019s resonating?\n\"People are thinking a lot about edge [computing] because even in highly populated environments, there's this recognition of the difficulties around power,\u201d says Founders Fund partner Trae Stephens. \u201cPeople are really and increasingly concerned about how we get enough power to the edge. How do we use the data that we\u2019re pulling off the edge?\u201d\nFounders Fund, which has been involved with Armada since the very beginning, is among a group of existing Armada investors that includes Lux Capital, Felicis, Valor Equity Partners, 8VC, and Shield Capital. The startup\u2019s mission, Stephens said, began with the relatively vague idea around disconnected compute.\n\"I feel like every good business has kind of a funny narrative for all of the ideas that it bubbles up at the beginning,\u201d Stephens says. \u201cThen, you're popping all of the bubbles, getting down to the thing that has real product-market fit.\"\n\u201cThere are 100 potential use cases,\u201d added Stephens.\nMany of these use cases seem to be oriented around high-stakes environments, where a well-timed safety alert can make the difference between life and death. (That\u2019s especially the case, say, on a fire-prone offshore oil rig.)\nIs that the deliberate focus?\n\u201cThe problems that matter the most can only be solved if you bridge the digital divide and bring connectivity, compute, and AI to the data\u2014wherever it is,\u201d Wright says.\nSee you tomorrow,\nAllie GarfinkleTwitter: @agarfinksEmail: alexandra.garfinkle@fortune.comSubmit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.\nJoe Abrams curated the deals section of today\u2019s newsletter.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Jennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Microsoft regained the title of most valuable company in the world after briefly falling behind Nvidia with the latter's recent stock split. However, it's been playing second fiddle to Apple for years and only recently slid into first place since Apple has been under some pressure.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is only in fifth place on the list of U.S. companies with the highest market caps, also behind Alphabet. It has extraordinary growth opportunities in several of its businesses, and the second-highest sales of any U.S. company behind Walmart. Can it become the most valuable company in the world?\nMarket cap is simply the price per share multiplied by the outstanding share count. In other words, it's the total dollar value of all of a company's stock. Amazon stock trades at $193 per share, and there are 10.4 billion shares outstanding, so the market cap is over $2 trillion. That makes it the fifth most-valuable company on the stock market.\nAs you can see in the chart above, Apple had been the most valuable company until recently, when Microsoft took over and Nvidia briefly topped it.\nMarket cap tells investors a few things. Highly valued companies are best in class, and they have proved that over time. Investors have piled in because these companies perform, quarter after quarter, and they're large businesses that drive the economy. In general, you can count on them to deliver, and they're low risk.\nBut highly valued companies might offer less growth for investors, since they're already so valuable. For the top three stocks here to even double at this point, they would be worth more than $6 trillion.\nIs it possible? Yes. But that comes with its own risk, since they would need to sustain their high value. It's easier to see Amazon or Alphabet doubling from where they are today.\nIn terms of valuation, none of these stocks are cheap. They all get a premium valuation for their reliable track records and incredible businesses. Nvidia tops them, trading at 73 times trailing-12-month earnings, and Amazon comes in second at 55.\nAmazon struggled a bit, like many companies, when inflation started soaring in 2022. It rebounded already last year, but the stock only surpassed its previous highs a few weeks ago, and it could be in its best position in a long time.\nOne reason is generative artificial intelligence (AI). It's today's hot topic, but it might have more staying power than other recent trends like cryptocurrency and the metaverse, and Amazon is a major player.\nIt has launched a powerful set of AI tools for its Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients, and as the leading worldwide cloud computing company, it stands to benefit in a big way from adoption of these tools. According to consulting company McKinsey, as much as 30% of workplace hours could be automated through generative AI, and it could add $4.4 trillion to the economy.\nAmazon is at the forefront of these endeavors, and CEO Andy Jassy recently said, \"I don't know if any of us have seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time.\"\nBut it's not just AI, with Jassy adding, \"We have a lot of growth in front of us, and that's before the generative AI opportunity.\" He said that AWS is already a $100 billion run-rate business, and that 85% of global spending on information technology is still on-premises, meaning not in the cloud. That leaves a massive opportunity for further spending in AWS.\nAnd AWS isn't even its biggest business, which is still e-commerce. Amazon has an unbeatable lead in that category globally and accounts for nearly 38% of all U.S. e-commerce. It has made strides in improving logistics to get more deliveries out faster, and as it speeds up shipments, more shoppers rely on it for even more of their daily essentials, leading to a positive growth cycle.\nThe company's fastest-growing business these days is advertising, which increased 24% year over year in the 2024 first quarter. It's a high-margin business, and with its new ad-supported streaming tier for Prime Video, Amazon is finding more ways to monetize its advertising capabilities.\nIt has an edge in this business because when customers see advertisements on the company's platform, they're already looking to buy, and that can lead to incredible conversion rates.\nAmazon can certainly muscle its way to the top of the market-value chain, just as it's pushing ahead and getting closer to becoming the largest U.S. company by sales. Regardless, it has tremendous opportunities in many ways, and its stock is a no-brainer buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Amazon wasn\u2019t one of them.

The industry has drawn antitrust scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\"After working with CISPE and its European members for more than a year, I am pleased that we've not only resolved their concerns of the past, but also worked together to define a path forward that brings even more competition to the cloud computing market in Europe and beyond,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith said.\nMicrosoft will develop a product allowing CISPE's members to run Microsoft software on their platforms on the U.S. tech giant's Azure cloud infrastructure with prices equivalent to Microsoft's prices, CISPE said. It has nine months to deliver.\nMicrosoft will also compensate CISPE members for lost revenues related to their licensing costs over the last two years, the group said. It did not disclose financial figures.\nMicrosoft has offered about 20 million euros in total, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nThe settlement does not include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform and AliCloud, prompting criticism from the first two companies.\n\"We continue to stand with the growing number of customers, providers, and regulators globally who are calling on Microsoft to end its discriminatory practices for all customers,\" an AWS spokesperson said.\nThe head of Google Cloud said he hoped regulators elsewhere would continue to look into Microsoft's licensing practices\n\"Many regulatory bodies have opened inquiries into Microsoft's licensing practices, and we are hopeful there will be remedies to protect the cloud market from Microsoft's anti-competitive behavior,\" Amit Zavery said.\n\"We are exploring our options to continue to fight against Microsoft\u2019s anti-competitive licensing in order to promote choice, innovation, and the growth of the digital economy in Europe.\"\nCISPE said it would now withdraw its EU complaint and would not start or support complaints on these issues in Europe and elsewhere.\n\"This agreement will provide a level playing field for European cloud infrastructure service providers and their customers,\" CISPE Secretary General Francisco Mingorance said.\n($1 = 0.9240 euros)\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Christina Fincher and Mark Potter)\n"

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) and AMD (AMD) started off the trading day on Wednesday heading in opposite directions as Wall Street digested the companies\u2019 Tuesday evening earnings. Microsoft fell some 7% in after-hours trading following its shaky report and continued trading down more than 1% Wednesday afternoon. AMD shares, on the other hand, jumped more than 3%, lifting fellow chip behemoth Nvidia (NVDA) as well.\nThe companies\u2019 results and Wall Street\u2019s reaction brought the two sides of the AI trade into stark relief as traders showed their disappointment in Microsoft\u2019s AI software sales and exuberance over AMD\u2019s chip sales.\nThe opposing views show how anxious investors are to see a sizable return on companies\u2019 massive investments in the infrastructure needed to power their AI software offerings. On the flip side, chipmakers like AMD continue to reap the benefits of software makers\u2019 AI infrastructure buildout, sending revenue and shares higher.\nIn an investor note following Microsoft\u2019s announcement, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill noted that Microsoft\u2019s Azure revenue slowed in the quarter from 31% in Q3 to 30% in Q4, and is expected to continue slowing in Q1.\nAnd while Microsoft said it expects to see improvements in Azure growth in the second half of its current fiscal year, investors\u2019 reactions to the company\u2019s slight miss on Intelligent Cloud revenue, which includes its Azure platform and analysts\u2019 repeated questions about when Microsoft will start raking in cash from AI sales, shows Wall Street won\u2019t wait forever for the AI trade to pay off.\nMicrosoft\u2019s fourth quarter earnings were largely positive despite its Intelligent Cloud numbers, and even those weren\u2019t awful. The company reported Intelligent Cloud segment revenue of $28.5 billion, just shy of Wall Street\u2019s expectations of $28.7 billion, but up 19% year over year. Overall revenue came in at $64.7 billion versus an expectation of $64.5 billion.\nBut Microsoft also continues to plow cash into building out its AI data centers. According to CFO Amy Hood, Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures, including finance leases, topped out at $19 billion, up from $14 billion in the third quarter.\n\u201cThis new figure requires faith that Microsoft is picking up sufficient demand signals, and in our view the \u2018return on capex\u2019 concerns are likely to persist,\u201d UBS Global Research analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following Microsoft\u2019s earnings announcement.\nStill, Microsoft pointed to a number of bright spots in its AI business, noting that AI contributed 8 percentage points of growth to Azure revenue, up from 7 percentage points in Q3 and 1 percentage point in Q4 last year.\nThe Windows maker also noted that it\u2019s still dealing with supply constraints keeping more customers from gaining access to its AI products, which is one of the reasons for its massive AI spend. That bottleneck, however, should start to clear up sometime in the second half of 2025, the company said.\n\u201cWe believe the results and outlook for Azure AI are especially strong in light of the capacity constraints [Microsoft] faced in [the fiscal fourth quarter] and expects to continue to see in 1HF25 [first half of 2025]. More positively, management expects these issues to be alleviated by 2HF25, which should help drive a reacceleration in overall Azure revenue growth,\u201d Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz wrote in a note to investors Wednesday.\nWhile Microsoft shares struggled to gain traction Wednesday, AMD\u2019s stock climbed more than 4% in mid-day trading Wednesday, driven by better-than-expected results from the company\u2019s Data Center segment. AMD reported Data Center revenue of $2.8 billion, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of $2.75 billion, and climbing 115% year over year from $1.3 billion in Q2 last year.\nMicrosoft\u2019s capital expenditure expansion also plays into AMD\u2019s growth, since the cloud provider, and hyper scalers like it, will inevitably need to purchase graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs) from the chip giant and its rivals, including Nvidia.\nTo that point, AMD raised its sales forecast for its AI chips for 2024 from $4 billion to more than $4.5 billion.

        "Text": "Microsoft (MSFT) released its fiscal fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, beating on the top and bottom lines, but missing on cloud revenue expectations.\nFor the quarter, Microsoft reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.95 on revenue of $64.7 billion. Wall Street was anticipating EPS of $2.94 on revenue of $64.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft reported EPS of $2.69 and revenue of $56.2 billion during the same period last year.\nMicrosoft's overall cloud revenue came in at $36.8 billion, in line with expectations of $36.8 billion, but the company's Intelligent Cloud revenue, which includes its Azure services, fell short, coming in at $28.5 billion versus expectations of $28.7 billion.\nShares of Microsoft were about 2% lower in pre-market trading on Wednesday, having fallen over 7% earlier in the wake of the results.\nWhile Microsoft's cloud business missed expectations, overall revenue still rose 21% year over year. Intelligent Cloud revenue, meanwhile, increased 19% year over year. What's more, Microsoft said AI services contributed 8 percentage points of growth to its Azure and other cloud services revenue, which increased by 29%.\nMicrosoft's AI miss sent shares of fellow AI-heavy companies like Meta lower in after-hours trading. The social media giant was off more than 3% on the news.\nThe report follows rival and Google parent Alphabet\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) earnings announcement last week, during which the company said it is seeing an uptick in cloud revenue partially due to interest in AI products.\nStill, Google didn\u2019t offer specific numbers on the impact of AI on the cloud business, leaving some analysts like UBS\u2019s Stephen Ju to predict that revenue benefits from the company\u2019s AI spending might not come until the first half of 2025 at the earliest.\nAccording to UBS analyst Karl Keirstead, Microsoft has also been grabbing more market share from Google and Amazon.\n\u201cIn terms of share shifts among AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, the most consistent theme in this round of checks was the number of customers and partners that cited share gains by Microsoft resulting from its early lead on the AI front,\u201d Keirstead wrote in a recent note about the three major cloud players.\n\u201cThis has been a recurring theme from checks over the last 6-12 months and the commentary about Azure\u2019s relative strength felt consistent with prior checks,\u201d he added.\nDuring Alphabet\u2019s earnings call, CFO Ruth Porat said the company spent $13 billion on capital expenditures, up from $12 billion in the prior quarter, adding that the vast majority of that spending is going toward AI.\nAmazon (AMZN) is set to report earnings on Aug. 1.\nShares of Google are up 22% year to date, while shares of Amazon are up 23%.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "By Aditya Soni, Yuvraj Malik and Anna Tong\n(Reuters) -Microsoft said it would spend more money this fiscal year to build out AI infrastructure even as growth slowed in its cloud business, another sign the payoff from hefty investments in the technology may take longer than Wall Street had hoped.\nShares fell 7% on the spending forecast but pared losses to trade down 4% after the bell on Tuesday after Microsoft said on a post-earnings call that Azure cloud growth would accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2025.\nBig technology companies have been pouring billions of dollars into data centers to capitalize on the generative AI boom. Google-parent Alphabet warned last week that its capital spending would stay elevated for the rest of the year.\nMicrosoft said its capital spending rose 77.6% to $19 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter that ends June 30, with cloud and AI-related spending accounting for nearly all of the expenditures. For all of fiscal 2024, capital spending totaled $55.7 billion.\nGroup CFO Amy Hood said the spending was necessary to support demand for AI services and the company was investing in assets that \"will be monetized over 15 years and beyond.\"\nStill, investors who have run up Microsoft stock by nearly a quarter in the past 12 months on AI optimism were disappointed with the Azure growth.\nMicrosoft predicted that the business would grow 28% to 29% on a constant currency basis in the July-September quarter, compared with estimates of 29.7%, according to Visible Alpha.\nThat followed a 29% rise in the quarter ended June 30, which was below estimates of 30.6% and marked a slowdown from the previous three months.\n\"The street doesn't have a lot of patience. They see you spending billions of dollars and they want to see a pickup in revenue of that amount,\" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, which holds shares in Microsoft.\n\"If these companies do not hit it out of the ballpark and are far better than the estimates then they are going to be knocked back,\" he added.\nWhile overall Azure growth slowed, AI services accounted for a larger portion of the increase in revenue in the June quarter at 8 percentage points, compared with 7 percentage points in the previous quarter.\nThe company does not break out the absolute revenue figure for Azure, the part of its business best situated to capitalize on booming interest in AI.\nCEO Satya Nadella said that Azure AI was now used by more than 60,000 customers, up nearly 60% year-on-year and that the average spend per customer continues to grow.\nNadella has pushed the company to go all-in on the technology, weaving AI into almost every product from search engine Bing to productivity software such as Word.\nLarge parts of those efforts have been fueled by technology from OpenAI, in which Microsoft has invested about $13 billion, including the 365 Copilot assistant for enterprises.\nThe productivity business - home to the Office suite of apps, LinkedIn and 365 Copilot - posted growth of 11%, compared with expectations of 10%.\nRevenue from its Intelligent Cloud unit - home to the Azure cloud-computing platform - rose 19% to $28.5 billion in the fourth quarter, missing analysts' estimates of $28.68 billion, LSEG data showed.\nMicrosoft - seen as a bellwether for the tech industry thanks to its wide-spanning business - said total revenue rose 15% to $64.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had expected $64.39 billion, according to LSEG data.\nRevenue from its personal computing business, which includes Windows and devices such as the Xbox and Surface computers, grew 14% as Microsoft benefited from stabilizing personal computer sales. The PC market grew for the second straight quarter in the April-June period, according to research firm IDC.\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni and Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and Anna Tong in San FranciscoEditing by Sriraj Kalluvila, Sayantani Ghosh, Matthew Lewis and Sam Holmes)\n"

        "Text": "On Friday, a flawed update from U.S. cybersecurity company CrowdStrike crashed Windows PCs all over the world, with computers displaying the dreaded \"blue screen of death.\" The outage hit global airlines particularly hard, disrupting thousands of flights as staff scrambled to get systems back online. Some airlines, like U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines, are still struggling.\nTony Fernandes, CEO of Capital A, owner of low-cost carrier AirAsia, says he's \"100%\" asking for compensation from Microsoft, the developer of the Windows operating system.\n\"If I delay my flight, you would come after me for a refund, right? Or if I cancel my flight, it means I need to give you a refund,\" Fernandes told reporters at an event in Subang, Malaysia.\n\"The principle is if we do something wrong, we have to compensate. They did something wrong. We and other airlines lost a lot,\" he said.\nTotal financial losses from the CrowdStrike outage could reach as high as $15 billion, insurer Parametrix estimated on Wednesday. The cost to Fortune 500 companies alone could be over $5 billion.\nMalaysia's digital minister has also chimed in. On Wednesday, Gobind Singh Deo suggested to reporters that five government agencies and nine companies were among those affected in Malaysia, and that he'd met with representatives from Microsoft and CrowdStrike to seek a full report, according to Reuters.\nServices at Asian airports needed to be done manually when the outage first hit on Friday, with passengers facing delays at both Singapore's Changi Airport and the Hong Kong International Airport. The outage affected services at over 10 airlines in Singapore and at least five in Hong Kong, according to local media reports.\nAirlines are still picking up the pieces from Friday's outage. Delta is still cancelling hundreds of flights, with over 6,000 flight cancellations since the outage began. It's the worst affected among the major U.S. carriers, and is now being probed by the U.S. Department of Transportation.\nFernandes has been on the warpath regarding Microsoft and CrowdStrike since the outage. On Sunday, the airline executive complained in a LinkedIn post that \"tech companies have little empathy\" for what airlines went through during the pandemic.\n\"Now they have issues they expect us all to understand. Well, I'm not going to. Airlines need answers and compensation,\" he wrote.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

It also agreed to use reasonable efforts for two years to hire an outside auditor to review its ad metrics.\nAdvertisers led by TopDevz of Sacramento, California and Noirefy of Chicago accused LinkedIn of inflating ad metrics by counting video ad \"views\" from users' LinkedIn apps, even when videos played only off-screen because users scrolled past them.\nThe lawsuit began two weeks after LinkedIn disclosed in November 2020 that its engineers fixed software bugs on the business-focused social media platform that may have led to more than 418,000 overcharges, most under $25.\nLinkedIn provided credits to nearly all affected advertisers.\nThursday's settlement covers U.S. advertisers who bought ads on LinkedIn between January 2015 and May 2023.\nIn a statement, LinkedIn said the settlement \"underscores our commitment to the integrity of our ads products and providing a trusted platform for our members and customers.\"\nLinkedIn is based in Sunnyvale, California, and Microsoft is based in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft's profit totaled $66.1 billion in the nine months ending March 31.\nJudge van Keulen had dismissed the lawsuit in December 2021.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Significantly high institutional ownership implies Microsoft's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions\nA total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 44% ownership\n Insiders have been selling lately \nIf you want to know who really controls Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 72% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\nInstitutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's market cap fell by US$169b last week. However, the 26% one-year return to shareholders may have helped lessen their pain. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future.\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Microsoft.\n See our latest analysis for Microsoft \nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Microsoft. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Microsoft's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Microsoft. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.3% and 4.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.\nOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\nOur most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Microsoft Corporation. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$1.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. \nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 27% stake in Microsoft. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Microsoft has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-07-22, Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $305.52. It's currently trading at a price of $437.11. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -43.07%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$11.56\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.22%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 17.50% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n160.25\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n145.28\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n305.52\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $183.55. This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -138.14%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

It enables eligible non-US investors to gain exposure to S&P 500 companies while keeping their assets on-chain and self-custodied.\n\"Backed is leading the charge towards the future of finance, where blockchain technology converges with the stability and familiarity of traditional financial assets,\u201d Adam Levi, Co-Founder of Backed, told Investing.com.\n\u201cOur tokenized equities, now expanded to include industry giants like Microsoft, Google, and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), represent a monumental leap toward a future where capital markets are fully tokenized, enabling greater market access, all on-chain. This is especially impactful for emerging economies in LATAM, Africa, and SE Asia, where demand for U.S. equities is surging, but access often remains limited.\u201d\nAs more assets move on-chain, asset managers will probably develop strategies to access new liquidity sources and arbitrage between on-chain and off-chain markets. They can apply fundamental portfolio construction principles and manage investment strategies in a digital asset context.\nThese new tokenized equities join Backed\u2019s existing products such as Backed CSPX Core S&P 500 (bCSPX), Backed Coinbase Global (bCOIN) (NASDAQ:COIN), and Backed NVIDIA (bNVDA). The products allow accredited investors to capture the upside of the stocks with the convenience of 24/7 trading on blockchain infrastructure.\nEach tokenized stock is fully backed by the corresponding stock to provide investors with confidence to trade on-chain. This also simplifies access to a broad spectrum of assets, eliminating the need for off-ramp funds. Backed\u2019s tokenized stocks are also designed to attract crypto organizations seeking diversification while keeping assets on-chain.\n\u201cTokenization breaks down these barriers, offering a more inclusive, efficient, and transparent way to invest globally,\u201d Levi told us.\nIn addition to equities, Backed offers tokenized corporate and government bonds, including T-bills. The introduction of five new tokenized stocks lets users create a diversified on-chain portfolio. Blockchain ledgers will handle legal ownership, allowing for composability, interoperability, and self-custody.\nBacked\u2019s tokenized equities are also designed for use within decentralized finance, where they can serve as collateral for loans and money markets, including stablecoins. The introduction of bMSFT, bGME, bMSTR, bTSLA, and bGOOGL increases opportunities for developers to create new products anchored by these digital assets.\nRelated Articles\nMicrosoft, Tesla, GameStop tokenized stocks launched by Backed\nMetaplanet Will Not Stop Buying Bitcoin, Adds 21.88 BTC to Portfolio\nBitcoin price today: rises to $63k on prospect of Trump presidency\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 22, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Nvidia NVDA.\nMany in the market are looking to the two members of 'the Magnificent 7' who report quarterly results this week to help reverse the stock market's recent weakness.\nThe immediate catalyst for the stock market pullback appears to be renewed uncertainty about regulatory and trade policies following the November elections, particularly with respect to export restrictions on semiconductor players. That said, we are in a seasonally soft time of the year and should perhaps resist the temptation to read too much into the recent weakness of the Mag 7 stocks, particularly given these stocks' impressive runs already.\nTeslais in a league of its own (up +21.3% since July 1st), while Microsoft (down -2.3%) and Alphabet (down -2.2%) are roughly tracking each other.\nThis pecking order, with Tesla at the top and Amazon and Nvidia at the bottom, is completely reversed when the starting point is changed to the start of 2024 instead of the start of 2024 Q3.\nWe have Tesla and Alphabet on deck to report Q2 results this week, both reporting after the market's close on Tuesday, July 23rd.\nThe current Q2 Zacks Consensus EPS for Alphabet of $1.85 has remained unchanged over the last two months, as has Tesla's Q2 EPS estimate of $0.62.\nFor Alphabet, the Q2 estimates of $1.85 per share on $70.6 billion in revenues represent year-over-year changes of +13.7% and +28.5%, respectively. Tesla's Q2 EPS estimate is -31.9% below the year-earlier period on +0.8% higher revenues.\nBoth stocks move big on the earnings release, but the EPS surprise isn't always the most important factor behind the stock's post-release reaction. Alphabet shares were up following the last quarterly release on April 25th, with the market appreciating the company's cloud results and AI outlook.\nTesla missed on the top and bottom-lines in the April 23rd quarterly release, but the stock was up following the numbers as the market liked the company's performance on the deliveries front. In fact, Tesla shares have been on a steady uptrend since the April 23rd release, reversing the persistent underperformance of the preceding period.\nThe other Mag 7 players will report the following week, with Nvidia being the last one to release quarterly results on August 28th.\nThe group is expected to bring in +25.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.3% higher revenues.\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. The group returned to the 'regular/normal' growth model last year, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q2 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +15.5% from the same period last year on +9.3% higher revenues.\nAs with the Mag 7, the Tech sector dealt with the pulled-forward revenues but is expected to remain firmly in growth mode.\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks leading the rising estimates trend. The current +17.2% earnings growth expected for the group is up from +14.2% three months ago. Estimates for next year have also gone up.\nThrough all the results that came out on Friday, July 19th, we have seen Q2 results from 71 S&P 500 members, or 14.2% of the index's membership. Total earnings for these 71 index members are up +8.7% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 83.1% beating EPS estimates and only 53.5% able to beat revenue estimates.\nThe Q2 reporting cycle really ramps up this week, with more than 500 companies on deck to report results, including 135 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Alphabet and Tesla, this week's line-up includes a representative cross-section of reports from different sectors, including bellwethers like Verizon and AT&T, UPS, Coke, GM and Ford, Spotify, IBM, Chipotle, and others.\nThe one notable feature of the above comparison charts is the very low Q2 revenue beats percentage. In fact, 53.5% is a new low for this group of 71 index members over the preceding 20-quarter period (5 years).\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actual results that have come out already with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +9% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues. This will be the highest quarterly growth pace since the +10% earnings growth rate in the 2022 Q1 period.\nAs we have been flagging all along in this space, we experienced a notably favorable revisions trend ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season, with estimates for Q2 holding up far better than other recent periods. In the three-month period from the start of the quarter through June 30th, Q2 estimates for the S&P 500 index fell the least relative to the comparable periods of other recent quarters.\nNot only is the Q2 earnings growth the highest since the first quarter of 2022, but the absolute level of aggregate earnings for the period is also on track to be a new all-time quarterly record.\nLooking at earnings expectations on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.8% on +1.6% revenue growth.\nThe expected revenue growth pace improves to +3.9% once Finance is excluded from the aggregate data, with the index level aggregate earnings growth for the year declining only to +8.7% on an ex-Finance basis.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q2 Earnings Season Starts Positively\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: AMD vs. Microsoft",
        "Author": "  Dani Cook, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Tech stocks have been on fire over the last year thanks to a rally in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. The Nasdaq Composite index, which includes many of the world's leading tech companies, has popped 21% year to date (outperforming the S&P 500's 16% rise). The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT toward the end of 2022 brought renewed interest in AI and illustrated its potential to boost countless industries.\nAs a result, the companies behind the hardware and software that makes AI possible have enjoyed significant stock gains. Two companies on Wall Street's radar are Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), with one a leader in chip design and the other delivering innovative ways to get AI into the hands of millions of consumers.\nThese companies could have bright futures in AI, a market projected to hit close to $2 trillion in spending by 2030. So, let's take a closer look at these tech giants and determine whether AMD or Microsoft is the better stock to invest in AI.\nShares in AMD have spiked 153% since the start of 2023. The company has gone full force into AI, motivated by its rival Nvidia's immense success in the industry. Nvidia's earnings and stock price have hit record heights as its AI graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the go-to for developers worldwide.\nAMD has responded by launching competing chips and has made promising progress, attracting customers like Microsoft and Meta Platforms. Meanwhile, the company is taking its cues from Nvidia, shifting to an annual chip release schedule rather than the two-year cycle it was previously on. So, after announcing its MI300X AI accelerator last year, the company followed that by unveiling its MI325X this June.\nHowever, AMD has its work cut out, with Nvidia responsible for between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market. These companies are by no means new competitors. AMD has played second fiddle to Nvidia in the desktop GPU market for at least the last decade. Since 2014, AMD's share of the sector has fallen from 35% to 12%, while Nvidia's has soared from 65% to 88%.\nAMD's performance in the desktop GPU market doesn't inspire much confidence yet in how it will do against Nvidia in AI. However, the rapid growth of the industry and soaring chip demand could play in AMD's favor, with room for Nvidia to retain its dominance and for AMD to find a lucrative role in meeting supply demands that its rival can't.\nWhile AMD faces the repercussions of a delayed start in AI, it's almost the opposite for Microsoft. The software king was an early investor in the industry, partnering with ChatGPT developer OpenAI in 2019. Microsoft has invested about $13 billion in the start-up over the years, making it OpenAI's biggest backer.\nThe partnership has made Microsoft a major threat in AI, allowing it to get a head start over competitors Amazon and Alphabet. Access to some of the most powerful AI models in the industry has enabled Microsoft to enhance multiple areas of its business. The company has integrated aspects of ChatGPT into its search engine, Bing, monetized new AI features on its Office productivity software, and brought generative tools to its cloud platform, Azure.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's AI efforts showed signs of paying off in its third quarter of 2024 (which ended in March). Revenue increased by 17% year over year to $62 billion, beating forecasts by more than $1 billion. AI appeared to boost multiple parts of its business, with revenue in its productivity and intelligent cloud segments increasing by 12% and 21%, respectively.\nMicrosoft's recent success saw it surpass Apple as the world's most valuable company this year. Yet, its dominance in tech and vast financial resources indicate it's nowhere near hitting its ceiling.\nAMD and Microsoft are at vastly different stages in their AI journeys, with one still figuring out where it stands among its competitors and the other enjoying success with increasingly established services.\nAs a result, the question of which of these companies is the better AI stock lies in their reliability. AMD's long-term position in AI is more uncertain than Microsoft's. Meanwhile, the chipmaker has significantly less cash reserves than the Windows company, which only creates more doubt about its future.\nMoreover, this chart shows that AMD's stock offers significantly less value than Microsoft's, illustrated by its far higher price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-free cash flow. AMD's earnings growth has yet to align with its share price, making it overvalued for now. Microsoft isn't exactly a bargain buy, but these valuation metrics show it's a more reasonably priced option.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft's considerably higher free cash flow indicates it's better equipped to continue expanding in AI and keep up with its rivals. As a result, Microsoft is the better AI stock and an attractive long-term buy right now.\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Advanced Micro Devices wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Carbon capture firm 1PointFive said on Tuesday it has entered into an agreement with Microsoft to sell the tech giant 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits over six years.\n1PointFive is the carbon capture, utilization and sequestration unit of oil and gas firm Occidental Petroleum. The agreement is a part of Microsoft's goal to become carbon negative by 2030.\nEarlier this year, telecom company AT&T had agreed to purchase CDR credits from 1PointFive as part of its goal to reduce emissions and become carbon neutral in its global operations by 2035.\nCarbon credits are tradable permits that allow the owner to emit certain amounts of greenhouse gases. Each credit permits the emission of one metric ton of carbon dioxide or the equivalent in other greenhouse gases.\n1PointFive said the CDR credits for Microsoft will be provided by STRATOS, its facility currently under construction in Texas, which is designed to capture up to 500,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually when fully operational.\n(Reporting by Tanay Dhumal in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)\n"

        "Author": "  Trevor Jennewine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) delivered what can only be described as monster returns for shareholders over the last five years. The stocks surged 2,490% and 195%,\u00a0respectively, while the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) advanced a mere 80%.\nBetter yet, that outperformance could continue in the coming years. Nvidia and Alphabet should benefit as businesses invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure, so much so that they could join Microsoft and Apple as members of the elite $3 trillion club in the near future.\nHere's what investors should know.\nNvidia currently has a market capitalization of $2.7 trillion, meaning shares would need to increase 11% for the company to reach a $3 trillion valuation. That could happen by the end of 2024. My reasoning is simple: Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs)\u00a0are the industry standard in accelerating complex data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI), and businesses are spending money hand over first where AI is concerned.\nCase in point, five large cloud computing companies -- Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Oracle -- will record $181 billion in capital expenditures (capex)\u00a0this year, according to JPMorgan Chase estimates. That implies 36% growth in capex spending, a substantial acceleration from 10% growth last year, primarily due to AI infrastructure buildouts.\nFew (if any) companies will benefit more than Nvidia. The chipmaker holds 98% market share in data center GPUs and up to 95% market share in AI processors, according to Mizuho Securities. Nvidia is also gaining momentum in other data center hardware categories. Its Grace central processing unit (CPU) is ramping toward a multibillion-dollar product line, and its InfiniBand/Ethernet networking platforms are already a multibillion-dollar business.\nIndeed, Nvidia could cross the $3 trillion threshold when it announces second-quarter results on Aug. 28. Wall Street underestimated sales and earnings growth in each of the last four quarters. Another low estimate could cause the stock to pop, and such an outcome seems plausible. CFO Colette Kress recently said that demand for H200 and Blackwell GPUs is \"well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year.\"\nBlackwell GPUs are state-of-the-art chips that can accelerate AI training and inference by factors of four and 30, respectively, compared to the previous Hopper generation. They are also more power efficient, such that they reduce the total cost of ownership by a factor of 25. CEO Jensen Huang\u00a0recently told investors, \"The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history.\"\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 34% annually over the next three years. That makes its current valuation of 66 times earnings seem fairly reasonable, and it puts a $3 trillion valuation within easy reach. In fact, assuming earnings grow as quickly as analysts expect, Nvidia would be a $4 trillion company in 2026, even if shares trade at a more reasonable 45 times earnings.\nAlphabet currently has a market capitalization of $2.1 trillion, meaning shares would need to increase 43% for the company to achieve a $3 trillion valuation. That could happen by the end of 2025. Alphabet is the largest adtech company and third-largest cloud infrastructure provider worldwide. Grand View Research expects those markets to grow at annual rates of 22% and 21%,\u00a0respectively, through 2030.\nBuilding on that, Alphabet has invested billions of dollars in AI product development over the years. Indeed, Forrester Research recently recognized its dominance in AI infrastructure solutions, and the company is bringing that expertise to bear on its adtech and cloud computing businesses.\nAlphabet recently added a conversational feature in Google Ads that lets brands create campaigns with natural language. It also introduced AI-powered image generation and profit-optimization tools to boost conversion rates. Those innovations should keep Google top of mind for advertisers. Additionally, CEO Sundar Pichai says AI Overviews in Google Search are boosting engagement and increasing user satisfaction, which should allay concerns about the company losing share in internet search.\nAdditionally, Alphabet has drawn more than 1.5 million developers to Google Cloud with Gemini, a multimodal model that can process language, images, video, audio, and computer code. The company is monetizing Gemini in several ways. For instance, Gemini powers a conversational assistant that automates tasks in Google Workspace applications, and it powers a conversational assistant that accelerates coding projects.\u00a0Also, Gemini can be fine-tuned and used to build custom generative AI applications.\nInvestment bank UBS recently published a report (Artificial Intelligence: Sizing and Seizing the Investment Opportunity) that divides the AI value chain into three layers: the enabling layer, the intelligence layer, and the application layer. UBS analysts wrote, \"We see the largest near-term opportunities in the enabling layer,\" which includes semiconductor companies like Nvidia and cloud computing companies like Alphabet.\nWith that in mind, Wall Street expects Alphabet to grow earnings per share at 17% annually over the next three years, yet shares trade at a relatively inexpensive valuation of 24 times earnings. By comparison, Wall Street expects Microsoft to grow earnings per share at 14% annually, yet the stock commands a relatively pricey valuation of 37 times earnings.\nIf Alphabet meets those expectations and the market affords the stock the same valuation as Microsoft, it would be a $4 trillion company by the end of 2025. In that context, reaching $3 trillion is easily achievable, and investors should consider buying a position in this stock today.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "US learning and development platform, Skillsoft, launched a GenAI upskilling program developed in collaboration with Microsoft on Tuesday (9 July).\nThe programme aims to upskill organisations and their workforce to effectively use Microsoft AI and GenAI technology in day-to-day operations, which the company say will boost productivity and innovation.\nSkillsoft\u2019s 'AI Skill Accelerator' will provide a blended learning experience including on-demand courses, group and one-on-one coaching, as well as hands-on practice labs.\n\u201cGenAI brings limitless opportunity to organisations,\u201d said Ron Hovsepian, executive chair of Skillsoft.\n\u201cWe're seeing this firsthand through Skillsoft's internal adoption of Copilot for Microsoft 365 and its potential to enhance our efficiency, creativity, and ability to achieve key business objectives,\" said Hovsepian.\nThe rise of AI has entered almost every workplace globally. Stratio BD, a GenAI and business data specialist, found on Tuesday (9 July) that 75% of IT decision-makers are expecting to increase their use of GenAI tools in the next 12 months.\nThe statistic follows Stanford University's AI Index Report in April, which found that AI had already surpassed humans in tasks such as image classification, understanding of English and visual reasoning.\nHowever, the report found that AI still struggled behind humans with more complex tasks such as advanced mathematics, commonsense reasoning and planning.\nGlobalData forecasts that the overall AI market will be worth $909bn by 2030, having grown at a compound annual rate of 35% between 2022 and 2030.\nIn the GenAI space, revenues are expected to grow from $1.8bn in 2022, to $33bn in 2027, a CAGR of 80%.\n\"Skillsoft partners with Microsoft to develop GenAI upskilling program for enterprises\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Text": "Tuesday, July 30, 2024The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), as well a micro-cap stock Applied Energetics, Inc. (AERG). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Microsoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+13.4% vs. +11.1%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.\u00a0Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth.\u00a0However, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern. \nThe market also appears to be starting to get concerned about the ever-rising trend in AI-focused capital spending without a lot of visiblity and discussion on the part of management with respect to outlay's ROI, as we saw with the Alphabet earnings release. It will be interesting if the coming Microsoft quarterly release will produce a comparable reaction or something different.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+31.5% vs. +6.2%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.Meta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 175 million monthly actives.\u00a0Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern, an issue that we also we encountered with Alphabet recently. It will be interesting to see how the market will react to the latest capex numbers from Meta.(You can read the full research report on Meta here >>>)JPMorgan Chase\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past year (+33.5% vs. +30.4%). The company\u2019s second-quarter 2024 results show a rebound in investment banking (IB) business. High rates, buyouts, opening branches and solid loan balance will aid net interest income (NII), though higher funding costs will weigh on it.\u00a0According to the Zacks analyst estimates for NII (managed) and loans imply a CAGR of 1.8% and 3.8%, respectively, by 2026. While there has been a resurgence in deal-making activities, a complete revival will still take some time. So, the performance of the IB business is not expected to improve much.The volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates will likely hurt fee income growth. Owing to these challenges, we expect non-interest income (managed) to rise in 2024 but decline next year. Mounting costs will hurt profits, and we expect it to rise 5.4% in 2024.(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)Shares of Applied Energetics have underperformed the Zacks Lasers Systems and Components industry over the past year (-44.5% vs. -34.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $269.19 million reported a sharp revenue decline in first-quarter 2024 due to contract modifications, increasing operating expenses and declining cash reserves.\u00a0Additionally, its reliance on government contracts and competition from established defense contractors, coupled with deficiencies in financial reporting controls, present significant challenges.\u00a0Nevertheless, Applied Energetics expanded operations at the University of Arizona Tech Park, establishing a new Battle Lab, and increasing laser manufacturing capacity to support technology maturation and customer demonstrations. With 25 patents and more than $50 million invested in intellectual property, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing directed energy weapons and counter-UAS markets. Recent contracts with the USMC, Army and Navy validate AERG\u2019s technology.(You can read the full research report on Applied Energetics here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

        "Author": "  Asra Isar ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of Billionaire Phillipe Laffont\u2019s Top 10 \u201cMostly AI\u201d Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against Philippe Laffont's other stock picks.\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont is a Founder & Portfolio Manager at Coatue Management, L.L.C. His fund\u2019s top 10 holdings comprise of mostly tech stocks which depicts his love for technology. His thirst for technology was such that after graduating from MIT with a computer science degree he applied for a job at Apple multiple times but was rejected every time. This pushed him towards another calling, which was to manage a hedge fund and its holdings.\nPhilippe Laffont\u2019s journey towards investing started when he moved to Spain where he started working at McKinsey. It was at this time when he learned about the \u201cboom of the PC\u201d and about the three pioneers of PC industry namely IBM, Dell and Microsoft. He decided to invest in these stocks which churned out more money than he was earning at that time. This led to his endeavors as an investor. In order to learn more about being an investor he got a chance to work at a mutual fund without pay where he learned about different terminologies related to the industry to \u201cget his foot in the door\u201d.\nAfter his employment ended in Julian Robertson\u2019s organization, he moved on to gather funds to start investing from his friends and family but most of his funds came from professional brokers and people who admired his entrepreneurial spirit. This led to the launch of his company on January 1, 2000, with $50 million at its disposal and the fund's AUM now stands at $50 billion. His investment philosophy is to provide longevity and good returns for the investors; and to have investors that would bet on him for the long term. Philippe Laffont\u2019s philosophy of helping out people is visible in his efforts to advise people on investing and he believes in helping any new tech \u201ckid\u201d that could become the next Tiktok.\nIn his interview at the Bloomberg Invest Philippe Laffont said that he is conflicted about whether small or big companies will be the AI winners. According to him the history of technology indicates that the big gets bigger but new companies have also made it through like Facebook or TikTok. He thinks that AI isn't overhyped and the valuations aren't out of whack right now. Here is what he said:\n\"It's true that the mentions of AI in every TV and and written form is very high. And so one could say, Wow, if everybody talks about it, it must be priced in. And the only reason why more positive is I remember when I invested in Apple in 2009 when the iPhone first came out and for years people told me, Why are you invested in Apple? Everybody talks about Apple. And obviously it had an incredible run. So I actually think that sometimes because someone speaks a lot about something, it might be actually a good sign versus an overhyped sign.\"\nPhilippe Laffont thinks the next phase of AI will be real estate with data centers and especially utilities with power. Another phase of AI, according to Philippe Laffont would be robots with artificial brains called humanoids. The technology hedge fund manager also made the following prediction which has a huge implication for the semiconductor stocks:\n\"I've made a lot of mistakes, You know, betting on these new technologies like AR/VR turns out to be not so big. 3D printing turns out to be not so big. My estimate is $100 trillion was invested in today's dollar in the PC, CPU based infrastructure. All this is going to get ripped out to put $100 trillion or more in our GPU based infrastructure.\"\nOur Methodology\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of Coatue Management at the end of the first quarter of 2024. In order to provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the first quarter of 2024 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\nA development team working together to create the next version of Windows.\nBarclays Venu Krishna recently indicated in its research report that mutual funds are taking interest in tech stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) leading to increase in shares about 30% over the past one year whereas the average estimate by analysts is a 14% upside from the current levels to $483. Microsoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Search business Bing\u2019s market share jumped to 3.64% as of April 2024, gaining 0.88 points YoY basis. Wall Street in addition to New Street Research, who have initiated the coverage on the stock with a Buy rating, believe that earnings are expected to grow in the low teens for near future.\nTo no surprise, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust holds around 36 million shares worth $15 billion making it the largest shareholder of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the first quarter of 2024. Coatue Management's holding in this stock is worth $1.5 billion with 3.6 million shares.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cOur second largest purchase during the quarter was the software platform,\u00a0Microsoft Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:MSFT), which we continued to add to, after initiating a position in the fourth quarter of 2023. Microsoft continues to report strong quarterly results, with revenue growth of 16% year-over-year in constant currency thanks to better-than-expected demand in its intelligent cloud segment, which saw revenue growth of 19% year-over-year, driven by Azure growth of 28% with AI contributing 6pts to growth compared with 3pts in the prior quarter. While the adoption of GenAI remains in its early stages, Microsoft has disclosed positive initial data points with 53,000 Azure AI customers as of its December quarter up from 18,000 in the prior quarter, 1.3 million paid GitHub Copilot subscribers (up 30% sequentially) and more than 230,000 organizations who have used AI capabilities in the power platform (up 80% sequentially). Management also noted that large cloud optimizations that started a year or so ago have largely finished. Profitability also continues to be strong with 44% non-GAAP operating margins, which was 120bps better than expected.\u201d\nOverall MSFT ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of billionaire Phillipe Laffont's top stock picks.

        "Title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA XLK, Microsoft and Apple",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks and ETF featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL.\nNVIDIA Corporation has experienced an impressive 146.6% surge in its stock price year to date (YTD), outperforming the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 Generalindustry and The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF\u2019s gains of 106.3% and 19.1%, respectively. This YTD performance makes the graphic processing unit (GPU) maker the third publicly traded U.S. company alongside Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc., which currently have a valuation of more than $3 trillion.\nWith a market capitalization of $3.414 trillion as of Jul 2, Microsoft is the most valuable company in the world. Apple holds the second spot with a market capitalization of $3.378 trillion, while NVIDIA is in the third position with a market capitalization of $3.058 trillion.\nAs a leading player in the semiconductor industry, NVIDIA has benefited from its dominance in GPUs and strategic expansion into artificial intelligence (AI), data centers and autonomous vehicles. Given this remarkable growth, the question arises whether it is too late to buy into NVIDIA or if there is still room for further appreciation.\nNVIDIA's remarkable stock performance has been primarily driven by the anticipation that the company will reap substantial benefits from the growing investments in generative AI. Given NVIDIA's leading position in this space and the vast opportunities generative AI presents, the stock seems poised to maintain its upward trajectory throughout the year.\nThe increasing demand for workflow modernization across various industries is expected to elevate the need for generative AI applications. According to a recent report by Fortune Business Insights, the global generative AI market is projected to reach $967.6 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.6% from 2024 to 2032.\nHowever, generative AI requires extensive expertise for content creation and significant computational power. As a result, enterprises developing generative AI-based applications will need to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\nNVIDIA's next-generation chips, renowned for their high computing power, are likely to become the preferred choice for enterprises. The company\u2019s GPUs are already widely used in AI models, which is expanding NVIDIA\u2019s presence in emerging markets such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\nThe generative AI revolution is expected to drive substantial demand for NVIDIA's next-generation, high-computing power chips. With the increasing AI investments in the data center sector, NVIDIA anticipates its second-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues to reach $28 billion from $13.51 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nNVIDIA's strong product portfolio, leadership in AI and relentless innovation present a compelling investment opportunity. Moreover, the shares of NVIDIA are trading above the 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend.\nThe company enjoys high market esteem, and savvy investors should consider leveraging NVDA\u2019s potential for sustained long-term growth. NVIDIA boasts an impressive long-term expected earnings growth rate of 37.6%, significantly outpacing the Zacks Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s growth rate of 18.9%. This semiconductor company\u2019s earnings have consistently exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 24%.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $117.55 billion, which indicates a year-over-year increase of approximately 93%. The consensus mark for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by a penny to $2.53 per share over the past seven days, which calls for year-over-year growth of 113.4%.\nFinancially, NVIDIA is on solid ground, with ample cash reserves that provide a cushion against market volatility. As of Apr 28, 2024, the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $31.44 billion, up from $25.98 billion on Jan 28, 2024.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s stock trades at a one-year forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 23.01, which is higher than the Semiconductor \u2013 General industry\u2019s forward P/S multiple of 19.2. While this might be perceived as a risk, the premium is justified due to NVIDIA's consistent financial performance and substantial growth prospects in emerging sectors such as automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\nAdditionally, NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and currently boasts a Growth Scoreof A, making it a highly attractive investment option, according to Zacks' proprietary methodology.

The Canva-like app lets people generate images and designs with text prompts to create things like stickers, greeting cards, invitations, collages and more.\nDesigner is now accessible in more than 80 languages on the web, available as a free mobile app and as an app in Windows.\nThe app features \"prompt templates\" that are designed to help jumpstart the creative process. The templates include styles and descriptions that you can experiment with and customize, and you can share templates with others in order to build on each other's ideas.\nIn addition to stickers, you can create emojis, clip art, wallpapers, monograms, avatars and more with text prompts.\nYou can also use Designer to edit and restyle images with AI. For instance, you can upload a selfie and then choose from a set of styles and write in any extra details you want to see to transform your photo.\nSoon, Designer will include a \"replace background\" feature that will allow you to use text prompts to transform images.\nWith the launch of the standalone Designer app, Microsoft shared that it's bringing the service to apps like Word and PowerPoint through Copilot. People who have a Copilot Pro subscription can create images and designs in their workflow. Soon, users will get the option to create a banner for their document in Word based on the content of their document.\nAs part of Wednesday's announcement, Microsoft revealed that Microsoft Photos on Windows 11 is getting a deeper integration with Designer. Users can now use AI to edit photos without leaving the Photos app. You can now do things like erase objects, remove backgrounds and auto-crop images directly within the app.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/17/microsofts-ai-powered-canva-like-designer-app-lands-on-ios-and-android/\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 24, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Nvidia NVDA.\nSeveral Mag 7 stocks, namely Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Nvidia, have faced pressure over recent weeks, temporarily halting their remarkable runs.\nInterestingly enough, the recent negative price action has coincided with a strong move from small-caps, perhaps reflecting a bit of rotation. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each since July 11, which was the day small-caps began to roar thanks to a favorable CPI print.\nIt raises a valid question: Are these beloved stocks' runs over, or should investors stay exposed? Let's take a closer look.\nRecent cloud strength has analysts optimistic for Microsoft, with the company expected to benefit nicely from AI. Cloud revenue popped 23% year-over-year throughout its latest period, reflecting a reacceleration and positively shocking investors.\nMany had feared a cloud slowdown, which did occur for a few periods, but the recent results paint a picture of positivity moving forward. The company's cloud results have remained positive overall, consistently exceeding our consensus estimates as of late.\nIn addition, earnings expectations for its current fiscal year have remained bullish, with the $11.77 per share expected suggesting 20% year-over-year growth. The favorable earnings picture will support near-term share performance, with the recent weakness likely reflecting profit-taking.\nMETA shares have benefited nicely from improved operational efficiencies that have significantly boosted profitability. The company remains firmly in growth mode, with earnings and revenue climbing 80% and 30% throughout its latest period.\nLike MSFT, the outlook for its current fiscal year remains bullish, with the $20.21 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 24% over the last year and suggesting a 36% year-over-year jump.\nThe company has been performing nicely, with its advertising revenue positively surprising in six consecutive quarters. It's worth noting that advertising represents the bulk of META's revenue.\nIn addition, META shares aren't expensive, with the current 23.6X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 37.0X. The current PEG ratio also works out to 1.2X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth.\nWhile shares have faced pressure, the company's outlook remains notably bright, and investors should block out the noise.\nBeloved Nvidia has faced some pressure recently amid a broader cooldown in the semiconductor trade. Nonetheless, shares are still up a staggering 150% year-to-date, and its earnings outlook fully supports further near-term gains.\nThe stock maintains the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to its above-mentioned earnings outlook, which has shifted bullishly across the board. The $2.69 per share expected for its current year suggests a 100% year-over-year pop in earnings, with sales also expected to see a 90% increase.\nThe stock has been at the heart of the AI trade, with its Data Center results consistently blowing away expectations as of late.\nBreakneck growth has kept valuation multiples at historically sound levels, with the current 39.1X forward 12-month earnings multiple below the 50.7X five-year median and five-year highs of 106.3X.\nKeep in mind that shares traded well above current valuation levels in 2020 and 2021, a time when the AI theme had yet to emerge fully.\nWhile several Mag 7 stocks have faced pressure over recent weeks, their outlooks and fundamentals underneath the hood remain more than sound.\nTheir recent weakness has coincided with a strong move from small-cap stocks, perhaps a reflection of rotation and profit-taking after remarkable starts to 2024.\nNonetheless, these stocks' runs certainly aren't over, and they remain prime selections for portfolios.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "3 Unstoppable Stocks That Could Join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in the $3 Trillion Club",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights ",
        "Text": "The U.S. Senate is sometimes called \"the most exclusive club.\" However, I can think of a club that's much more exclusive than the legislative body, which has 100 members. It's the $3 trillion club.\nOnly three companies in the world boast market caps of $3 trillion or more: Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. But this club might be a little less exclusive in the not-too-distant future. Here are three unstoppable stocks that could join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia in the $3 trillion club.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is in the driver's seat to become the next $3 trillion company. The Google parent's market cap currently stands at around $2.3 trillion. At the rate the stock is climbing, it's not out of the question that Alphabet could join Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia by early 2025.\nMost of Alphabet's revenue and profits continue to be generated by its Google Search business. While some have predicted the rise of generative AI presents an existential threat to search engines, Google has thrived. CEO Sundar Pichai noted in Alphabet's first-quarter earnings call that Google's new AI overviews have increased search usage and user satisfaction with search results.\nGoogle Cloud should enjoy a strong tailwind from AI for years to come. The unit's sales jumped 28% year over year in Q1 with operating income soaring 371%. Google Cloud is especially popular with generative AI start-ups, with more than 60% using its cloud service.\nYouTube is another key growth driver for the company. It's the leader in U.S. streaming with viewers watching over 1 billion hours of content daily. YouTube now has over 100 million music and premium service subscribers, while YouTube TV claims over 8 million paid subscribers.\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) isn't too far behind Alphabet, with a market cap hovering around $2 trillion. I fully expect the e-commerce and cloud services giant will also take a spot in the $3 trillion club within the next two or three years.\nLike Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS) should deliver strong growth in the years ahead thanks to the demand for building and deploying AI models. AWS is the leader in the cloud services market. I suspect it will stay on top because of the appeal of new products such as AI-powered software development assistant Q.\nAmazon dominates the e-commerce market. Cost improvements in the company's e-commerce platform and distribution network have helped to boost profitability. As Amazon increases delivery speed further, its e-commerce revenue and profits should grow as customers shop online more frequently.\nAdvertising is also an important growth engine for Amazon. In Q1, advertising sales soared 24% year over year on a constant-currency basis. This growth could increase in the future as advertising on Prime Video gains momentum.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has a steeper hill to climb to join the $3 trillion club. The social media leader's market cap of $1.3 trillion is well below the market caps of Alphabet and Amazon. However, I think it's only a matter of time before Meta reaches the $3 trillion threshold.\nThe company is an advertising juggernaut. Its apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, reach more than 3.2 billion people across the world every day. Advertisers can' ignore such a massive audience.\nMeta's efforts to more efficiently monetize its products, especially Reels, are paying off handsomely. Profits more than doubled year over year in Q1. The company continues to get better and better at showing ads to the right person at the right time.\nAI presents a major growth opportunity for Meta. In particular, CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that AI-powered business messaging will be the \"next major pillar\" of the company's business.\nYou might think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are no-brainer stocks to buy if they're truly on track to join the $3 trillion club. And you'd be right, in my view.\nAll three stocks have tremendous growth prospects. The growth drivers already mentioned don't even tell the full story. For example, robotaxis could be huge opportunities for Alphabet's Waymo and Amazon's Zoox units. Meta could be a bigger winner in virtual reality and the metaverse. I think Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are great stocks to buy and hold.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you\u2019d have $21,904!*\nApple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you\u2019d have $43,562!*\nNetflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you\u2019d have $349,245!*\nRight now, we\u2019re issuing \u201cDouble Down\u201d alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\nSee 3 \u201cDouble Down\u201d stocks \u00bb\n*Stock Advisor returns as of July 8, 2024\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 30, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL.\nGet ready for some action this week in the stock market as four of the Magnificent 7 tech giants \u2014 Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple \u2014gear up to report their quarterly earnings.\nThese tech titans have been the primary drivers of this year\u2019s return, pushing the market to new heights. But with the recent bout of market volatility, the big question remains: Is now the time for investors to dive into tech stocks?\nHere, we will explore the broader picture of the sector and potential outcomes of these quarterly earnings reports and try to figure out if any or all of them are worthy additions to investor portfolios at current levels.\nLast week, following the quarterly report from Alphabet, investors started to grow cautious. Concerns about overinvestment into AI infrastructure and its ability to generate profits moving forward have been the main cause of selling over the last week.\nManagement\u2019s comments about Capex regarding AI will be an important talking point for all these stocks.\nAlong with weakness in Alphabet, Semiconductor stocks and the other Mag 7 stocks have experienced considerable selling. But are these concerns overblown? I think they may be, and with another quarter of impressive growth likely coming, and reasonable valuations from the group, this dip could be a buying opportunity.\nAmazon is expected to post a 63.64% year-over-year increase in earnings to $0.54 per share, with revenue projected at $140.88 billion, driven by robust AWS and North American retail operations. Apple, despite a slight revenue dip to $81.64 billion, is forecasted to achieve earnings of $1.19 per share, bolstered by its services and wearables segments.\nMeta Platforms anticipates a significant earnings jump to $3.04 per share, a 45% jump and $31.05 billion in revenue, fueled by strong ad revenue and user engagement. Microsoft is projected to deliver $2.72 per share in earnings and $62.03 billion in revenue, reflecting Azure's impressive performance and continued strength in Office and LinkedIn.\nOverall, the Mag 7 is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\nLooking at the valuations of these tech giants we see a spectrum of results. Although they are broadly trading at reasonable levels, two of them look much more appealing than the others.\nMeta Platforms stands out with a free cash flow (FCF) yield of 4.1%, above its 10-year median of 3.2%, making it particularly attractive. Amazon too boasts an FCF yield of 2.6%, above its 10-year median of 1.8%.\nApple, on the other hand, has a FCF yield of 3%, which is below its 10-year median of 5.7%, indicating it may be pricier relative to its historical norm. And Microsoft shows a similar trend with an FCF yield of 2.2%, below its 10-year median of 3.6%.\nI think it may be a bit of a crapshoot buying these names ahead of earnings, but the reasonable valuations and secular tailwinds these companies enjoy make them compelling buys if they sell off further following the reports.\nCritical to the performance of these stocks through the end of the year is investors' perception of AI. Can these companies turn a profit in their new AI products? The answer is probably yes, but shareholders want to see hard evidence.\nAnother worthy consideration is the setup in the broader market and the approaching US Presidential Election. Big tech has been carrying the market higher all year, and it may be time for a pause in this run. Additionally, as the election approaches so does the perceived uncertainty, and investors may rotate into defensive sectors until after it concludes.\nHowever, it is hard to understate the long-term growth catalysts at these big tech companies \u2013 they are almost all expected to grow earnings faster than the market, which will drive even higher stock prices in the coming years.\nAny pause they take now, or in the coming months, is likely an opportunity to acquire shares in these generational assets.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Invest with Confidence: Intrinsic Value Unveiled of Microsoft Corp",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\nAs of 2024-07-08, Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $305.52. It's currently trading at a price of $467.56. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -53.04%. The company is modestly overvalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$11.56\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.31%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 17.50% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n160.25\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n145.28\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n305.52\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $183.55. This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -154.73%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The trade was made on July 26. Pelosi's disclosed trades are made by her husband Paul Pelosi, who is a venture capitalist.\nThe filing also disclosed selling $1 million to $5 million in Microsoft shares, with the subject line stating that 5,000 shares were sold. The trade was made on July 26, several days before the technology company reported fourth-quarter financial results.\nPelosi previously disclosed buying 10,000 Nvidia shares valued at $1 million to $5 million in early July along with the sale of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares. The congresswoman and her husband also disclosed buying 50 call options of Nvidia back in November 2023 that have risen significantly in value since the filing.\nDon\u2019t Miss:\nWith returns as high as 300%, it\u2019s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires.

As Benzinga has previously reported, holding onto the shares would have turned into millions of dollars in profits had they held onto the stake. The sale was completed after Pelosi came under public scrutiny over the timing of the trade, related to its proximity to the passage of the CHIPS Act and a trip to Taiwan.\nThe Series Portfolios Trust Unusual Whales Subversive Republican Trading ETF (KRUZ) and the Series Portfolios Trust Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic Trading ETF (NANC) track the trading activity of Republican and Democratic members of Congress, respectively.\nA new ETF is also on the way from Tuttle Capital that will combine trades from both parties, and base holdings on the trading accuracy and performance of members of Congress and their committee assignments.\nA bill to ban trading by members of Congress is currently working its way through the legislative body and could change what happens in the future.\nNVDA Price Action: Nvidia shares are up 11% to $115.15 on Wednesday. Nvidia stock has risen 131% year-to-date in 2024.\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\u00a0\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high.

Cloud service providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM, and Oracle provide native solutions. These solutions are seamlessly incorporated into their corresponding cloud platforms, offering users easy access to financial management tools designed for each provider's ecosystem's unique characteristics and services. In contrast, ServiceNow, Hitachi, Virtasamt, Flexera, and Deloitte provide third-party solutions.

Asia Pacific comprises China, Japan, Australia & New Zealand, India, and the Rest of Asia Pacific. Significant growth is observed in the Asia Pacific due to the swift uptake of cloud technologies and the rising need for effective cloud cost management solutions. As companies in the area adopt digital transformation projects, they transfer the bulk of their tasks to the cloud to improve flexibility, scalability, and innovation. The increase in cloud usage has created a strong demand for FinOps services to manage expenses and optimize resources. The increasing intricacy of cloud environments fuels the market's growth in the region. Managing and optimizing cloud costs becomes more complex as organizations implement a variety of cloud services and embrace multi-cloud and hybrid cloud designs.\nInquire Before Buying @\u00a0https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=197106360\nThe growing emphasis on digital transformation and innovation significantly propels the market growth in the Asia Pacific region. The region's businesses use cloud technologies to boost innovation, improve customer interactions, and attain a competitive edge. However, the fast growth of cloud usage and advancements has raised concerns regarding cost management and resource optimization. Cloud FinOps services help organizations find a middle ground between innovation and cost control by offering visibility into cloud expenses and supporting well-informed choices to align cloud spending with business goals.
