        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Social media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0has grown remarkably, soaring approximately 490% in under two years. However, Meta recently saw its most significant market cap decline since 2022, shedding around $200 billion following its Q1 results. The stock received downward revisions in target prices across Wall Street. The crucial question now is whether to buy or sell. Personally, I view this as an opportunity to invest in the stock based on its AI-based growth trajectory. I believe it can keep rising.\nMeta\u2019s Q1 adjusted earnings of $4.71 per share handily beat the consensus estimate of $4.32 per share. Also, earnings more than doubled year-over-year compared to earnings of $2.20 per share in the prior-year period. Revenues jumped 27% year-over-year to $36.5 billion, meeting consensus estimates by $36.2 billion.\nThe revenue jump was fueled by a 27% rise in Advertising revenue (accounts for 98% of total revenues) to $35.64 billion. However, the Reality Labs division (the division that invests in the Metaverse) continued to report losses, amounting to $3.85 billion for the quarter.\nDespite the EPS beat, the stock experienced its largest single-day decline (15%) in over two years. This decline can be attributed to lower-than-expected revenue guidance and higher-than-expected capital expenditures (CAPEX) forecasts.\nThe Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent expects Q2 total revenue to range between $36.5-39 billion, while the consensus was pegged at $38.3 million. CAPEX is expected to increase to $35-40 billion versus the prior guided range of $30-37 billion. Further, expenses are expected to increase and are forecasted to continue to increase through next year. For FY2024, total expenses are predicted to range around $96-99 billion versus the prior guided range of $94-99 billion.\nDuring the earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg elaborated on Meta\u2019s heightened investment plans in AI infrastructure. The company aims to inject billions into the AI space and develop its proprietary AI chips, thereby reducing dependence on chipmakers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nIn terms of newer products, the company also announced that MetaAI, featuring Llama 3 (competing with Microsoft\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini), is poised to become the most efficient AI assistant. This innovation could represent a substantial business opportunity in the coming years, further contributing to revenue growth.\nMeta\u2019s AI investment plans align somewhat with its major competitors, who are also making substantial investments in the AI domain. While Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported CAPEX of $12 billion in the recently ended first quarter, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) spent $14 billion. Both Google and MSFT plan to escalate their CAPEX spending in AI in the upcoming quarters.\nHowever, Google and Meta\u2019s shares soared after their recent earnings. On the contrary, Meta\u2019s shares plunged as their capital investments are still not visible in their revenue and earnings growth. For instance, Google and Microsoft\u2019s capital investments in AI are yielding impressive growth in their cloud businesses. However, Meta\u2019s Reality Labs business segment still remains unprofitable, with reported losses exceeding $45 billion since the end of FY2020.\nIn essence, while AI spending is translating into direct gains for Google and Microsoft, it\u2019s taking Meta longer to show such returns, turning it into a capital-intensive, cash-sucking endeavor. Therefore, the following question arises: should investors wait and observe or buy the stock at current levels following the recent decline?\nIn the long run, Meta\u2019s move to produce its own chips will likely benefit the company significantly by reducing costs associated with expensive GPUs procured from NVDA currently. Additionally, owning its AI infrastructure promises faster and more efficient processing of vast amounts of data for the social media giant.\nIn terms of its valuation, Meta is attractively valued. Currently, it\u2019s trading at an attractive P/E ratio of 23.5x compared to much higher multiples of its peer group. For the sake of comparison, Microsoft is trading at a P/E of 35x, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading at over 50x.\nDespite elevated capital expenditures, Meta\u2019s free cash flows remain healthy at $49.5 billion for the past 12 months, or 4.1% of the current market capitalization. It is worth noting that the company started a dividend for the first time in the preceding quarter and continued to buy back shares, implying that management is confident in the company\u2019s fundamentals.\nThe Wall Street community is clearly optimistic about the stock. Overall, META commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell. Meta Platforms stock\u2019s average price target of $530.93 implies 11.73% upside potential from current levels.\nSocial media giant Meta has built a vast user base over time, establishing itself as the clear industry leader. Its steady position among the world\u2019s \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d mega-cap stocks is well-deserved, supported by the continued growth in advertising revenue per user. Notably, Meta\u2019s revenues and margins have been growing impressively, and the integration of AI infrastructure across its portfolio is poised to drive revenues even higher in the coming years.\nFor those who missed out on Meta\u2019s remarkable stock rally (second only to NVDA) over the last two years, the current dip presents a buying opportunity, in my view. I personally plan to buy the stock and hold it for the long term.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Author": "  Demitri Kalogeropoulos, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "When Wall Street is too focused on the short term it can create great buying opportunities for patient investors. You can scoop up shares in a stock during periods of elevated pessimism and set yourself up for market-beating returns -- if you're willing to hold through some volatility.\nThat could be the situation facing investors with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) today. The social media giant's share price fell after management said in a recent earnings update that sales growth might slow in the coming quarters even as spending soars on artificial intelligence (AI) investments.\nAlong with the concerning guidance, there was plenty of good news about the business in the quarterly report that the market seemed to ignore. Let's look at five positive takeaways from the late April earnings update that suggest Meta Platforms is a buy right now.\nMeta's collection of social media apps isn't struggling to grow. The daily active user base rose 7% to hit 3.24 billion, up from 3.19 billion in late 2023. \"We're seeing strong momentum within our family of apps,\" management said in a press release.\nThat success is critical because it's the foundation of revenue growth in Meta's core advertising business. Sales were up a blazing 27% year over year in Q1, landing at $36.5 billion.\nMeta is doing a better job balancing its advertising sales. Most of its growth comes from higher ad impressions and Meta delivered 20% growth year over year in ad impressions in Q1. That isn't sustainable at this pace. Yet rising prices are amplifying this growth, with prices up 6% compared to the prior quarter's 2% uptick. Ideally, higher prices will allow Meta to lean less heavily on increased ad impressions as the year progresses.\nWall Street wasn't thrilled to hear that management projected higher spending through 2024 and 2025 as Meta invests in building up an AI lead. Still, the company heads into this ramp-up period with excellent financial momentum. Expense growth was just 6% in Q1, trailing revenue growth by 21 percentage points. That gap pushed the operating margin to 38% of sales from 25% of sales a year ago. Operating earnings nearly doubled to $14 billion.\nExecutives aren't abandoning the cost-cutting approach that has helped push profitability so much higher in the past year. \"We're very focused on ... discipline throughout the company, even as we are investing to support AI and Reality Labs initiatives,\" CFO Susan Li said in late April.\nShareholders are increasingly seeing more direct cash returns from this business. There's the company's recently initiated dividend, of course. But Meta is also aggressively buying back stock. Dividend payments totaled $1.3 billion last quarter while share repurchases were $15 billion. That's a bit higher than free cash flow in the period, which was just over $12.5 billion.\nThere's no denying that Meta Platforms plans to spend much more cash over the next few years on projects that don't have a clear payoff in sight. The Reality Labs division lost $4 billion in Q1 on just $380 million of revenue, for example, and executives say this trend shouldn't improve dramatically in the short term. Meta spooked some investors when explaining its expectations for spending on AI in 2025 and beyond. \"We have tremendous ambitions in the AI space,\" Li said in a conference call.\nThat prospect for higher spending shouldn't turn investors off to this stock, though, which is down 10% from recent highs. The next year shouldn't be as impressive when it comes to profitability gains, sure. But Meta Platforms can invest in its growth ambitions while still generating strong overall returns.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In the past five years, shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have climbed 149%. That's a solid return although it has been anything but a smooth ride. Shares tanked 64% in 2022 as investors became overly pessimistic about the company's prospects.\nWhere will this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock be in five years? To come up with an educated guess, I think it's worthwhile to consider what could change and what will stay the same.\nDuring the three-month period that ended March 31, Meta reported having 3.24 billion daily active users across its family of apps. That includes some of the world's most popular social media services, like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. That user base, while already gargantuan, expanded by 7% year over year.\nEven though Meta is a daily part of the lives of 40% of the world's population, there's no reason to believe that in 2029, it won't still be a massive social media enterprise. Consequently, this means the business will probably still generate the bulk of its revenue from digital advertising.\nIn 2023, 98% of sales, or a whopping $132 billion, came from digital-ad efforts, putting Meta squarely behind Alphabet on the industry leaderboard. \nThe management team's focus on investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives is a strategy that should bear fruit over time. Users of the various apps can interact with Meta AI that improves the experience and makes it easier to find the information they're looking for. This could drive higher engagement.\nMoreover, Meta has already launched generative AI features to better serve its advertising customers. There are claims being made that these tools could boost return on spend and cut down on labor hours. As advertisers view Meta as an invaluable partner, more ad dollars could flow its way.\nFounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is always thinking about what comes next. He deserves tremendous credit for building Meta into a trillion-dollar company in about 20 years' time. But investors are skeptical about where his head is at now.\nThis relates to Meta's metaverse ambitions. The company already sells augmented reality glasses and virtual reality headsets that allow users to interact with the world and each other in new ways. \"Zuck\" is trying to build the next major computing platform.\nThe issue, though, is that these offerings aren't catching on. In the past 12 months, its Reality Labs business only generated a total of $2 billion in revenue. That barely moves the needle for Meta. It's been consistently losing huge amounts of money. Just in the last quarter, it posted an operating loss of $3.8 billion.\nZuckerberg hopes there will be 1 billion people using metaverse-related products and services one day. But based on the latest trends, it's difficult to see this happening anytime soon. I'd bet that even if Reality Labs really takes off, it will pale in comparison to the family of apps in terms of how they influence the company's financials. \nMeta has optionality, but it's still a digital-ad enterprise at heart.\nThere are very few businesses that can invest so aggressively behind unproven technologies, while still producing incredibly high margins and earnings. Even if Reality Labs becomes a flop, the core social media and digital-ad operations are so lucrative in their own right.\nAnd this warrants a closer look from investors. Shares have skyrocketed 289% since the start of 2023. But they trade at a reasonably forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.7. This looks like a smart investment to buy and hold for the next five years.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (META) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned -7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has lost 5.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.66 per share, indicating a change of +44.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.10 points to a change of +35.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.12 indicates a change of +15% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.9%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $38.14 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +19.2%. The $158.94 billion and $179.9 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.8% and +13.2%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $36.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.3%. EPS of $4.71 for the same period compares with $2.64 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.48%. The EPS surprise was +9.03%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has been grappling with declining investor confidence despite delivering better-than-expected financials for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. Shares of META have declined by nearly 7% over the past month.\nThe decline comes amid a flurry of activities to expand the company's operations as CEO Mark Zuckerberg focuses on an ambitious push into artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse.\nMark Zuckerberg, the founder of Meta Platforms, kicked off the company\u2019s recent earnings call by emphasizing the importance of artificial intelligence. However, despite his enthusiasm for future prospects, investors seemed skeptical.\nThe stock experienced a significant drop of up to 19% in extended trading on April 24, wiping out over $200 billion in market capitalization. This decline occurred despite Meta reporting better-than-expected profit and revenue for the first quarter.\n\"I think it's worth calling that out, that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it,\" Zuckerberg stated during the earnings call.\nZuckerberg highlighted future monetization strategies, including the integration of ads or paid content into AI interactions. He also discussed opportunities for expansion in the mixed-reality headset market, emphasizing the potential for AI integration in devices like AR glasses.\nWhile Zuckerberg remains optimistic about the long-term potential of AI products, he cautioned investors about the multiyear investment cycle required for these ventures to become profitable services.\nDespite the company\u2019s efforts to innovate, Meta\u2019s Reality Labs unit, responsible for developing the metaverse, continues to incur substantial losses. With sales of $440 million for the quarter and losses totaling $3.85 billion, the division\u2019s cumulative losses since 2020 exceed $45 billion.\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.\nMiami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city with as little as $500 before that happens.\nMeta\u2019s financial performance for the first quarter exceeded expectations, with earnings per share of $4.71 and revenue of $36.46 billion, surpassing Wall Street estimates of $4.32 and $36.16 billion, respectively. However, a light revenue forecast for the second quarter overshadowed these results, contributing to the stock sell-off.\nMeta announced its projected sales for the second quarter, which are estimated to range between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. The midpoint of this forecast, at $37.75 billion, reflects an 18% year-over-year growth. However, this figure falls short of analysts\u2019 average expectation of $38.3 billion.\nThe company is currently focusing on developing emerging technologies like glasses and mixed reality, which currently do not yield profits. Meta also disclosed that capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to range between $35 billion and $40 billion, marking an upward revision from the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.\nInstitutional investors have recently discovered a new strategy to hedge against market volatility and enhance portfolio stability \u2013 home equity investments (HEIs). HEIs allow investors to gain exposure to residential real estate by purchasing a portion of a homeowner\u2019s equity in their property. In exchange for a lump sum payment, investors receive a share of the future appreciation of the home\u2019s value.\nAccording to Morningstar DBRS Senior Vice President Derek Moran, \u201cInterest in this market is high and can be expected to continue growing, especially if interest rates remain high, and homeowner equity stays strong.\u201d\nHEIs offer compelling benefits for investors, including:\nDiversification: HEIs provide exposure to the residential real estate market, helping to diversify portfolios heavily allocated to stocks and bonds.\nAttractive returns: HEIs have the potential to generate strong returns, particularly in an environment of rising home prices. Originators often secure HEIs at a discount to market value, providing immediate upside potential.\nDownside protection: HEI contracts typically include protective provisions that mitigate losses in the event of declining property values.\nUncorrelated returns: HEI performance is primarily driven by home price appreciation rather than interest rates or stock market fluctuations.\nNow, with the emergence of innovative platforms like Cityfunds, retail investors can access this institutional-grade asset class with as little as $500. Cityfunds allows you to invest in the equity of carefully selected properties in prime locations, targeting potential appreciation while mitigating risk.\nInvestors can choose to invest in specific cities through Cityfunds\u2019 offerings, such as Miami, Austin and Los Angeles, gaining exposure to some of the strongest real estate markets in the country. These Cityfunds have demonstrated impressive appreciation, with shares of the Miami Cityfund up 14.7% already and up 10.9% for the Austin Cityfund.\nYou can easily get started by signing up on the Cityfunds website and choosing which cities you want to invest in.\u00a0\nElon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here\u2019s how to invest in the city\u2019s growth before he floods it with new tech workers.\nCollecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Jeff Bezos gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started.\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta CEO.

In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Insider Monkey recently analyzed billionaire Druckenmiller's latest Q1'2024 portfolio to see which AI stocks the billionaire was buying. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is part of the 10 Best AI stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller.\nBut the interesting question to answer is: Is Meta really the best AI pick of Druckenmiller?\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 242\nAfter bagging huge profits from his Nvidia stake, billionaire Stanley Druckemiller is pouring money into the consumer-side AI companies that are using AI technologies to their advantage to boost and optimize online content consumption, including text, images and video. Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office bought a $31,043,000 stake in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) during the first quarter of 2024.\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), thanks to its multiple revenue streams and the huge user base it captures (Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp), can leverage AI to its advantage in a much efficient way when compared to peers. For example, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) plans to use 'Llama 3' LLM to introduce new automation features in its business messaging on Facebook. This technology, called \"Business AIs\", would help consumers get answers to their questions and will speed up the buying process. Analysts believe this could give further boost to online shopping on the platform.\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has also revealed Generative adversarial networks (GANs) technology to create images, text-to-video generative AI application called Make-A-Video and several other tools for consumers to play with AI, causing a rise in usage and engagement.\nOn the backend, Meta Platforms Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0is using AI for optimize ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year.\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion. \u00a0However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it'll bode well for the stock down the road.\nMeta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) management sensed the need to calm investors about this metric during the latest earnings call. Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) CFO Susan Li said:\nWe anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30 billion to $37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect CapEx will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In closing, Q1 was a good start to the year. We\u2019re seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.\nPatient Capital Opportunity Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) was a top contributor in the first quarter gaining another 37.5%. Performance has been supported by strong top and bottom-line growth as the company maintains its leadership in the advertising space, despite Reels still being under monetized versus Newsfeed and Stories. The company continues to return cash to shareholders, increasing their buyback program by another $50B in February (6.4% of shares outstanding), and announcing their first dividend of $0.50 per share (0.39% yield). The company trades at 25x this year\u2019s earnings, which we do not view as too demanding for a company with some of the best AI assets, an improving topline that should lead to free cash flow outperformance and continued capital return.\u201d\nMeta Platforms Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0shares have gained about 92% over the past one year.\nDespite the positive sentiment and growth catalysts, Insider Monkey's research shows that Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is not the best AI stock to buy in Stanley Druckenmiller's portfolio.\n\u00a0\nClick to see The Best AI Stock in Stanley Druckenmiller's Portfolio better than Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n You can also see the complete list of Stanley Druckenmiller's 10 Best AI Stock Picks in 2024. \nDisclosure:None\n"

        "Title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong: Should Prospective Shareholders Make The Leap?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "It is hard to get excited after looking at Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) recent performance, when its stock has declined 6.1% over the past month. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Meta Platforms'  ROE.\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nThe formula for ROE is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Meta Platforms is:\n31% = US$46b \u00f7 US$150b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.31 in profit.\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nTo begin with, Meta Platforms has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 7.4% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This probably laid the groundwork for Meta Platforms' moderate 11% net income growth seen over the past five years.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Meta Platforms' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 6.0% in the same period, which is great to see.\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is META fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\nMeta Platforms' three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 2.8% (implying that it retains 97% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.\nLooking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 9.2% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 23% over the same period.\nOn the whole, we feel that Meta Platforms' performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Capital expenditure for 2024 is now expected between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from the previous expectation of $30-$37 billion.Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time (\u201cseveral years\u201d), as per the Meta CEO.\nGeographically, revenues from the United States & Canada, Asia-Pacific, Europe and the Rest of the World (RoW) surged 21.3%, 25.5%, 33.7% and 41.8% on a year-over-year basis, respectively.Revenues from Family of Apps (98.8% of total revenues), which includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and other services, increased 27.2% year over year to $36.02 billion.Family Daily Active People or DAP, defined as a registered and logged-in user who visited at least one of the Family products (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and/or WhatsApp) on a given day, were 3.24 billion, up 7.3% year over year.Advertising revenues (99% of Family of Apps revenues) increased 26.8% year over year to $35.64 billion and accounted for 97.8% of first-quarter revenues.

As a percentage of revenues, total costs and expenses were 62.1%, significantly down from 74.8% reported in the year-ago quarter.In the reported quarter, Family of Apps expenses were $18.4 billion, accounting for 81% of Meta\u2019s overall expenses. FoA expenses were up 7% year over year, primarily due to higher legal and infrastructure costs.Reality Labs\u2019 expenses were $4.3 billion, down 1% year over year.As a percentage of revenues, marketing & sales expenses decreased 360 basis points (bps), while general & administrative expenses fell 60 bps on a year-over-year basis.Research & development expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 27.4%, down 540 bps on a year-over-year basis.Meta\u2019s employee base was 69,329 at the end of the first quarter, down 10% year over year but up 3% sequentially.Operating income of $13.82 billion jumped 91.2% year over year.

Cohen, who also owns The New York Mets, founded SAC Capital back in 1992, and since then through 2009 lost money only once. A Bloomberg report earlier this year said that Point72 Asset Management has been able to raise so much cash recently that it's starting to decline external money. The fund has reportedly raised about about $12.8 billion since 2020.\nPoint72's main fund returned about 11% in 2023, and 12% in the previous year.\nBillionaire Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management runs a highly diversified portfolio. As of the end of the March quarter, the portfolio's net worth was over $41.2 billion, with tech stocks accounting for 17% of the total portfolio.\nUnlike long-term value investors like Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman, Cohen moves with speed and adapts quickly. He's been like this for decades. When he was in Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, he would often skip classes to watch stock movements at a local brokerage. He took pride in predicting stock movements based on their direction.\nCohen, worth over $19 billion, is yet again adapting to the quickly changing global financial landscape as investors demand steady returns. Earlier this year, it was reported that Cohen and his team is expanding macro teams at Point72 as the global economy resets to the new era of high interest rates.

But the use of generative AI didn\u2019t affect the company\u2019s ability to disrupt those networks, Meta said Wednesday in the report.\nAmong the disinformation campaigns, the company found a deceptive network from China sharing AI-generated poster images of a fictitious pro-Sikh movement, and an Israel-based network posting AI-generated comments praising Israel\u2019s military under the pages of media organizations and public figures. The company said it removed many of those networks before they were able to build audiences among authentic communities.\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re not seeing gen AI being used in terribly sophisticated ways,\u201d Meta\u2019s policy director of threat disruption, David Agranovich, said Tuesday during a press briefing. Tactics such as creating AI-generated profile photos or using artificial intelligence to produce large volumes of spammy content, haven\u2019t been effective so far, he said.\n\u201cBut we know that these networks are inherently adversarial,\u201d Agranovich said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to keep evolving their tactics as their technology changes.\u201d\nSocial media companies such as Facebook, ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s TikTok and Elon Musk\u2019s X have struggled with the influx of fake and misleading AI-generated content on their sites. This year alone, doctored audio of US President Joe Biden and fake images of the Israel-Hamas conflict circulated on social media, gathering millions of views.\nNick Clegg, Meta\u2019s president of global affairs, has been vocal about the need to detect and label AI-generated content, especially as the company prepares for the 2024 election cycle. Global elections will take place in more than 30 countries this year, including many places where the company\u2019s apps are widely used, such as the US, India and Brazil.\nClegg has said that creating an industry standard around watermarking is the \u201cmost urgent task facing us today.\u201d Meta has been working on the ability to detect and label images that were created by tools from AI companies such as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and OpenAI. The company has already starting adding visible markers to some images as well as invisible markers and identifying information in image files.\nMeta recently updated its policies to label misleading content on its site that is AI-generated, rather than remove it. The company also requires advertisers to disclose when they use AI to create Facebook or Instagram ads related to social issues, elections or politics, but the company doesn\u2019t fact-check political ads by politicians.\n(Updates with image detection in the eighth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year\nDisney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track\nThe Budget Geeks Who Helped Solve an American Economic Puzzle\nIsrael Seeks Underground Secrets by Tracking Cosmic Particles\nHow Rage, Boredom and WallStreetBets Created a New Generation of Young American Traders\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

Alongside, our most recent consensus estimate is anticipating revenue of $38.15 billion, indicating a 19.22% upward movement from the same quarter last year.\nFor the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $20.19 per share and revenue of $158.97 billion, which would represent changes of +35.78% and +17.84%, respectively, from the prior year.\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.4% higher. Meta Platforms is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.\nIn the context of valuation, Meta Platforms is at present trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 23.49. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 29.28, so one might conclude that Meta Platforms is trading at a discount comparatively.\nOne should further note that META currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.23. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. META's industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.7 as of yesterday's close.\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 61, putting it in the top 25% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an incredible technology that is changing how business is conducted and how people search the internet. However, this isn't happening without substantial input costs. Many big tech firms are investing millions (if not billions) of dollars into their computing infrastructure to support the rise of AI.\nHowever, not all investors like this. If these companies spend on infrastructure, they're posting smaller profits. That's not music to the market's ears, so when companies mention that, they can get hit. That's exactly what happened to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) after it reported first-quarter results. But the information companies like Meta give investors during their conference calls can be like gold, as the crumbs of all the conference calls reveal one clear winner.\nIn Meta's Q1 conference call, Susan Li, Meta's CFO, discussed the company's investment in AI infrastructure:\nAs we develop more advanced and compute-intensive recommendation models and scale capacity for our generative AI training and inference needs, we expect that having sufficient infrastructure capacity will be critical to realizing many of these opportunities. As a result, we expect that we will invest significantly more in infrastructure over the coming years.\nPrior to that, she mentioned that Meta sees great opportunities in the various AI technologies it's developing. This is a long-term investment, and with most investors in the market focused only on the short term, this announcement isn't what they wanted.\nAs a result, Meta increased its 2024 capital expenditure costs to $35 billion to $40 billion from its previous $30 billion to $37 billion. It also stated that even though it hasn't issued guidance for next year, it expects it to increase thanks to AI research.\nClearly, the infrastructure needed for AI buildout isn't done yet. Another company shares the same sentiment.\nTesla officials mentioned in the company's conference call with analysts that it has 35,000 H100 graphics processing units (GPUs; made by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)) up and running, but that number should increase to 85,000 by the end of the year.\nMeta is also using Nvidia's products, so it's becoming clear who the real winner in all of this is: Nvidia.\nNvidia is the market leader in GPUs and has a significant market share advantage over its competitors. Its growth has been nothing short of incredible over the past year. Announcements like Meta's stating they will only accelerate their infrastructure buildout are a bullish sign for the company.\nFurthermore, the GPUs customers are installing now may be obsolete in five years, so there should be significant revenue in the future as older GPUs are cycled out. This gives credence to analyst firms like Precedence Research, which believes the global GPU market opportunity could be $773 billion by 2032. With Nvidia already holding a significant market share, it's set to capture a large chunk of this opportunity.\nThis already helped transform Nvidia into one of the world's most powerful companies, and it's not set to relinquish that title soon. As more companies build out their AI products, Nvidia will be set to benefit.\nBut does that make the stock a buy?\nBecause Nvidia is still growing rapidly, using trailing metrics is unwise. So, we'll look at its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.\nAt 34 times forward earnings, Nvidia is still a very expensive stock with many expectations baked into it. But if its growth rate continues for several years, this still could be a bargain price for the stock, as long as you're willing to endure the volatility it brings.\nIf you can, it's clear that the long-term opportunity for Nvidia's primary product is still there, and the infrastructure needed to support the proliferation of AI is yet to be fully constructed.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $564,547!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Author": "  Kurt Wagner ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. has spent the last several years overhauling its flagship social networking app, tweaking people\u2019s feeds to feature a broader array of posts and videos in an effort to stave off competition from TikTok and win back younger users.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nModi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority\nShort Sellers in Danger of Extinction After Crushing Stock Gains\nBonds Rally as Traders Reload Fed Bets After Data: Markets Wrap\nStock Pickers Defy Wall Street Norm to Risk It All on a Few Bets\nIntel CEO Takes Aim at Nvidia in Fight for AI Chip Dominance\nIn late 2021, TikTok was on the rise, Facebook interactions were declining after a pandemic boom and young people were leaving the social network in droves. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg assembled a handful of veterans who\u2019d built their careers on the Big Blue app to figure out how to stop the bleeding, including head of product Chris Cox, Instagram boss Adam Mosseri, WhatsApp lead Will Cathcart and head of Facebook, Tom Alison.\nDuring discussions that spanned several meetings, a private WhatsApp group, and an eventual presentation at Zuckerberg\u2019s house in Palo Alto, California, the group came to a decision: The best way to revive Facebook\u2019s status as an online destination for young people was to start serving up more content from outside a person\u2019s network of friends and family.\nJust over two years later, the shift has shown signs of success. Facebook\u2019s user base in the US and Canada \u2014 the most important markets for the company\u2019s core advertising business \u2014 is suddenly growing again after years of stagnation. Young adults in those markets are using Facebook more than they have in years, and advertising revenue continues to rise.\nMeta\u2019s move was precipitated by the TikTok juggernaut. The short-form video app owned by China\u2019s ByteDance Ltd., exploded in popularity around 2020 by serving up an addictive stream of personalized content based on a user\u2019s interests and preferences. Facebook, by contrast, had largely relied on users\u2019 online connections \u2013 the friends and family that made up their \u201csocial graph\u201d \u2013 to determine what posts people saw.\nAs TikTok occupied ever more attention amid the younger crowd, Meta\u2019s top brass decided in late 2021 that Facebook needed to do something similar and began building new \u201crecommendation\u201d algorithms. It was a notable departure from the \u201csocial graph\u201d strategy that had defined Facebook\u2019s service for nearly two decades.\n\u2018Threshold Decision\u2019\n\u201cThis did feel very much like one of those threshold decisions,\u201d said Alison, who still runs the Facebook app. \u201cIt was scary because there was always this underlying fear of \u2014 if you go in that direction, do you walk away from your social heritage? Does a lot of the social activity on the site that makes it what it is, does that go away as well?\u201d\nBut Meta took the plunge and made \u201crecommendations\u201d a core part of its product strategy. Its top priority for deploying the new algorithm was initially in Reels, a TikTok clone that debuted on Instagram in 2020. Today, 50% of the content people see on Instagram is considered a \u201crecommendation\u201d from an AI algorithm.\nThe company also started pushing outside content within Facebook\u2019s Feed toward the end of 2021, a significant decision considering the main social network was still the company\u2019s most lucrative product. Making that change within a new product like Reels was an easy decision, but there was concern that tinkering with the flow of content in what used to be known as the News Feed could drive down Facebook usage or hurt Meta\u2019s business.\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to be the case, at least so far. Today, an average of 30% of the posts that people see in their Facebook Feed are suggestions from outside of their network, more than double the number from two years ago. Advertising revenue, meanwhile, was up 15% in 2023 compared with 2021.\nPerhaps most surprisingly, Facebook is having a notable resurgence in user growth. Its audience in the US and Canada grew by 10 million people over 2022 and 2023. It didn\u2019t add any net new users in 2021.\nFacebook is even growing in popularity again with 18-to-29-year-olds, a demographic that had been on the decline for years. Pew Research found that 67% of US adults in that category used Facebook in 2023, down from 81% five years earlier. But the company\u2019s flagship social network has seen five straight quarters of growth from daily active users in that age range in the US and Canada, a spokesperson said. It now has more than 40 million young adults using Facebook every day, its highest total in three years, the spokesperson added.\nIt\u2019s a stark reversal that runs counter to the broader narrative around Facebook, that the flagship network is mostly for \u201colder\u201d people. It\u2019s unclear if Feed changes are the main driver of that growth, but Meta executives are encouraged nonetheless. What\u2019s materialized is not necessarily an abandonment of the friends and family mindset that made Facebook dominant for years, but rather a new level of comfort in straying from that strategy when necessary.\n\u201cIf the first thing you see in your news feed \u2013 if the best thing for you in that moment is a recommendation \u2013 we should be able to show that to you,\u201d Alison said. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t quite wrapped our heads around that yet\u201d in 2021.\nMeta\u2019s push toward \u201crecommendations\u201d may have been inspired by TikTok, but it was also made possible by recent advancements in artificial intelligence technology, company leaders say.\nShowing people content related to their social circle typically means Meta\u2019s algorithms need to rank content from a pool of, at most, a couple thousand posts. Pushing content to people from outside of their network, though, increases the pool of potential posts exponentially. Now, any of the billions of photos, links or videos on Facebook could theoretically be a fit for a given user, creating a more elaborate ranking challenge that the company is still perfecting.\nIn 2022, Meta engineers spent a lot of time and resources moving the new algorithms from CPU processors to more powerful \u2014 and expensive \u2014 GPU processors that can more quickly analyze greater volumes of data, Alison said. This strategy has also become a key talking point with investors.\n\u201cOur investments in developing increasingly advanced recommendation systems continue to drive incremental engagement on our platforms demonstrating that people are finding added value by discovering content from accounts they\u2019re not connected to,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said on Meta\u2019s latest earnings call. The company also told investors that it was increasing capital expenditures for the year, in part to spend more on AI.\nUniversal Recommendation Algorithm\nThis strategy has been a reversal of sorts from prior Feed changes. In 2018, Meta publicly updated Facebook\u2019s algorithm to show more posts from friends and family at the expense of content from businesses and media organizations. Zuckerberg described it at the time as leaning in toward \u201cmeaningful social interactions.\u201d\n\u201cToo often today, watching video, reading news or getting a page update is just a passive experience,\u201d he wrote at the time.\nMeta insists the company\u2019s focus on \u201crecommendations\u201d isn\u2019t an abandonment of friends and family content, but rather a new balance between the two. Alison said Meta has been careful to try and avoid a scenario where the things you see on Facebook are the exact same posts you can find anywhere else online.\n\u201cHow do you lean into recommendations but then how do you still do that in a way that honors and takes advantage of our social heritage?\u201d he said. \u201cYou could end up in a place where you just become commoditized, like you\u2019re recommending the same stuff as everybody else. So we went through all those debates.\u201d\nMeta has plans to expand \u201crecommendations\u201d further. Right now, most of the company\u2019s algorithms are product-specific \u2013 the algorithm for Feed is different than the one for Reels, which is different than the one for Facebook Marketplace, its Craigslist competitor.\nBut Meta is working on a more universal algorithm that could work across all its various features. In a perfect world, a user who visits Marketplace to buy an Instant Pot, for example, might then also see recommendations for cooking-related content within other products, like Groups or Reels.\n\u201cThat is a big focus for us I would say this year,\u201d Alison said. \u201cIf we are right, you\u2019re going to have the Instant Pot experience much more frequently across many more products.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nStartup Brings New Hope to the Pursuit of Reviving Frozen Bodies\nThe Budget Geeks Who Helped Solve an American Economic Puzzle\nYes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year\nElon and Donald Seem to Have Made Up\nDisney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "AMZN vs. META: Which Magnificent Seven Stock Is Better?",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "In this piece, I evaluated two of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), using TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool below to see which is better. A closer look suggests a bullish view for Amazon and a neutral view for Meta.\nOf course, neither company needs an introduction, but Amazon is an e-commerce and cloud-computing giant, while Meta Platforms owns and operates several social networks, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and others.\nShares of Amazon are up 15% year-to-date and have soared 69% over the last year, while Meta Platforms stock is up 22% year-to-date and 80% over the last 12 months.\nAlthough their year-to-date performances are somewhat similar, that\u2019s where the similarities between these two companies end. While both are part of the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks, they operate in totally different businesses despite both having a technology bent.\nHowever, a closer look at their latest earnings results and the market\u2019s reactions to those reports reveals something very interesting. In short, investors initially rewarded one for spending more on artificial intelligence technology and punished the other for the same thing.\nIt seems clear that both Amazon and Meta Platforms could benefit from improved AI technology, but unfortunately, this sort of manic-depressive behavior is commonplace on Wall Street right now. Let\u2019s see if those totally opposite reactions were warranted.\nAt a P/E of 50.9x, Amazon is trading at a discount to its five-year mean price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 72.2x. Its forward P/E of about 36.4x is also quite attractive and suggests analysts are projecting significant increases in earnings over the next 12 months. Thus, a bullish view seems appropriate, especially considering the cloud computing results in Amazon\u2019s latest earnings report.\nFor the first quarter, Amazon reported adjusted earnings of 98 cents per share on $143.3 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of 84 cents per share on $142.5 billion in revenue. Sales in North America rose 12% year-over-year to $86.3 billion, while international sales grew 10% year-over-year to $31.9 billion. Revenues in the cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), surged 17% year-over-year to reach $25 billion.\nAmazon\u2019s management guided for second-quarter revenue of $144 billion to $149 billion, which came up short of the consensus estimate of $150.1 billion, and operating income to be between $10 billion and $14 billion. Analysts are also projecting adjusted earnings of $1.02 per share for the second quarter.\nAlthough Amazon stock initially dropped after the April 30 earnings release, it recovered quickly, soaring from about $179 before the release to around $185 now. This action is particularly interesting in light of the company\u2019s disappointing guidance, as the Street has typically been punishing companies that come up short of expectations in their outlooks.\nHowever, the initial post-earnings drop could have been due to the press release with the disappointing guidance, with the rebound coming after the earnings call. On that call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attributed the recently achieved $100 billion annual revenue run rate for AWS to their AI-related enhancements.\nEvercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney also told clients in a note on Tuesday that it was the first quarter since Q3 2022 in which AWS\u2019s total-dollar revenue growth surpassed that of Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. In fact, AWS is becoming more profitable as well, with its operating income jumping 84% to $9.4 billion and its operating margin expanding to 37.6% from 24% in the year-ago quarter.\nAll of this adds up to a bright future for Amazon, which suggests that it\u2019s meaningfully undervalued at current multiples.\nAmazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 42 Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $213.74, the average Amazon stock price target implies upside potential of 18.65%.\nAt its current P/E of about 25.1x, Meta Platforms is trading roughly in line with its five-year mean P/E of about 26.5x. Its forward P/E of 21.6x suggests analysts are looking for a relatively small earnings increase over the next 12 months, but it\u2019s not a significant drop between the current and forward P/E, suggesting a bit more stability rather than soaring earnings to come. Thus, a neutral view seems appropriate, especially considering a key piece of the latest earnings report.\nMeta Platforms posted its latest earnings results on April 24, reporting adjusted earnings of $4.71 per share on $36.45 billion in revenue versus the consensus numbers of $4.32 per share on $36.15 billion in revenue. However, investors were displeased with the company\u2019s revised outlook, which boosted its expected capital expenditures.\nMeta now expects to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion on capital expenditures (capex) this year, up from the previous guidance of $30 billion to $37 billion. The company said those increased capex will enable it to speed up its infrastructure investments in support of its AI roadmap.\nMeta stock plunged $50 following that release, as investors actually penalized the company for its increased AI spending. However, a key difference from Amazon is that Amazon is already showing results from its AI investments, while Meta is merely planning for future AI enhancements. Of course, Meta has already rolled out some AI enhancements, like its AI chatbot, but it clearly is planning much more with that sizable increase in capex.\nAdditionally, Meta\u2019s Reality Labs division continues to report sizable losses, so investors may be concerned about the company\u2019s ability to transform new technologies into profits. In the first quarter, Reality Labs posted a loss of $3.85 billion, bringing its losses to more than $45 billion since the end of 2020.\nMeta Platforms has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $530.93, the average Meta Platforms stock price target implies upside potential of 20.2%.\nWhile it\u2019s hard to go wrong with Amazon or Meta Platforms, Amazon is the clear winner of this pairing due to its valuation, successful implementation of AI to boost demand, and results from its cloud computing division, AWS.\nOn the other hand, Meta\u2019s AI ambitions are incomplete as it significantly boosts spending on AI. As a result, those AI efforts look like a bit of a show-me story, at least until the capital is spent and we see the results of those ambitions. It\u2019s understandable that investors would be concerned about Meta\u2019s ability to turn its new technologies into earnings based on the Reality Labs losses that are piling up.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "Meta Platforms Is Paying the Price of High Expectations",
        "Author": "  Grahamites ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported first-quater 2024 earnings on April 24. In a statement, founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, \"This is a good start to the year.\" However, despite his positive assessment, the market was clearly disappointed with the company's results and second-quarter guidance as itsstock dropped 12% after the earnings release, which has been a rare occurrence over the past few quarters.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META.\nList of 52-Week Lows\nList of 3-Year Lows\nList of 5-Year Lows\nThe last time Meta's stock plummeted was on Oct. 27, 2022, following the company's dismal third-quarter 2022 earnings report. It is obvious that while the first-quarter results were more than satisfactory, investors' expectations were indeed too high.\nMeta reported revenue of $36.50 billion, an all-time high for a first quarter, representing year-over-year growth of 27.30%. This is the fastest revenue growth rate since the third quarter of 2021. However, investors were disappointed the company did not achieve its upper range of guidance of $37 billion. Meta's net income was $12.40 billion, also a record for the first quarter.\nThe Family of Apps segment was the main driver for Meta's revenue growth. The Family of Apps segment reported revenue of $36 billion, growing 27% year over year. Of the $36 billion segment revenue, ad revenue was $35.60 billion, also up 27% year over year. The growth of ad revenue is very healthy as it was driven by both volume and pricing. In the first quarter, ad volume (total number of ad impressions) grew 20% while pricing (average price per ad) grew 6%. Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li explained during the earnings call thatwithin ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by gaming and entertainment and media. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia Pacific and Rest of World. Pricing growth was driven by advertiser demand.\nInterestingly, when asked about contributions from Chinese-based advertisers, Li refused to quantify the first-quarter contribution from China and declined to provide expectations on quarterly China-based ad revenue. This is understandable as both Temu and Shein are facing more rigorous scrutiny from the U.S. government.\nThe Reality Labs segment is still burning cash. This segment's revenue for the period was only $440 million, while incurring $4.30 billion in segment expenses. The operating loss was $3.80 billion.\nStarting from this quarter, Meta will no longer report daily active users and monthly active users for its Facebook platform, and it will also stop disclosing the number of monthly active people for its Family of Apps. The only number Meta will disclose going forward is its daily active people for its Family of Apps. For March, Meta's DAP for the Family of Apps was 3.24 billion, an increase of 1.57% quarter over quarter and 7.28% year over year.\nMeta has made impressive progress on its artificial intelligence offerings over the past few months. A week before announcing its earnings results, the company released its latest version of Meta AI powered by its latest model Llama 3. According to Chatbot Arena, which is an open-source research project developed by members from Large Model Systems Organization (LMSYS Org) and UC Berkeley SkyLab, Meta's Llama 3's ranking was tied at number six. Meta's previous model Llama 2 did not even make it to the top 10 list.\nZuckerberg sounded very excited about Meta AI's progress. During the earnings call, he said:\nThe initial rollout of Meta AI is going well. Tens of millions of people have already tried it. The feedback is very positive. So we've started launching Meta AI in some English speaking countries, and we'll roll out in more languages and countries over the coming months. We believe that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AIS system that you can freely use. We're seeing good progress on some of these efforts already. Right now, about 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by our AI recommendation system. That's up 2x over the last couple of years. And for the first time ever, more than 50% of the content that people see on Instagram is now AI recommended.\nAs we all know, AI models are extremely costly. Meta has invested heavily in AI capabilities and will continue to do so in the near future. For 2024, the company previously guided for capital expenditures of $30 billion to $37 billion. The company has revised the capital expenditure to $35 billion to $40 billion. This will likely adversely impact near-term earnings.\nDuring the quarter, Meta repurchased $14.64 billion worth of stock and paid $1.27 billion in cash dividends. Clearly, the social media giant is still committed to enhancing shareholder returns.\nFor the second quarter, management gave a revenue guidance range of $36.50 billion yo $39 billion, with a midpoint of $37.75 billion. The midpoint represents a year-over-year growth rate of 18%, while the upper range represents a year-over-year growth rate of 21.90%. Even if Meta can achieve the upper range of revenue growth, it would still be the slowest revenue growth rate since the third quarter of 2023. Combined with the more-than-expected capital expenditure guidance, it is not surprising that investors may have to lower their expectations for full-year 2024.\nIn terms of valuation, at the current market capitalization of approximately $1 trillion, Meta is trading at a trailing 12-month price-earnings ratio of 22. It does not look expensive, but also not very cheap either.\nInvestors' expectations for Meta oscillated from extremely low to extremely high between the third quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2024. It looks like Meta's core Family of Apps ad business will continue to grow in the near term. Going forward, clearly AI will be a big focus for both the company and investors. Personally, I cannot judge whether the huge investment in AI will generate the return on investment Zuckerberg hopes to achieve, but I know if Meta does not invest heavily in the technology, the company will fall behind in the race. Time will tell.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Meta said on Wednesday it had found \"likely AI-generated\" content used deceptively on its Facebook and Instagram platforms, including comments praising Israel's handling of the war in Gaza published below posts from global news organizations and U.S. lawmakers.\nThe social media company, in a quarterly security report, said the accounts posed as Jewish students, African Americans and other concerned citizens, targeting audiences in the United States and Canada. It attributed the campaign to Tel Aviv-based political marketing firm STOIC.\nSTOIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations.\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\nWhile Meta has found basic profile photos generated by artificial intelligence in influence operations since 2019, the report is the first to disclose the use of text-based generative AI technology since it emerged in late 2022.\nResearchers have fretted that generative AI, which can quickly and cheaply produce human-like text, imagery and audio, could lead to more effective disinformation campaigns and sway elections.\nIn a press call, Meta security executives said they removed the Israeli campaign early and did not think novel AI technologies had impeded their ability to disrupt influence networks, which are coordinated attempts to push messages.\nExecutives said they had not seen such networks deploying AI-generated imagery of politicians realistic enough to be confused for authentic photos.\nKEY QUOTE\n\"There are several examples across these networks of how they use likely generative AI tooling to create content. Perhaps it gives them the ability to do that quicker or to do that with more volume. But it hasn't really impacted our ability to detect them,\" said Meta head of threat investigations Mike Dvilyanski.\nBY THE NUMBERS\nThe report highlighted six covert influence operations that Meta disrupted in the first quarter.\nIn addition to the STOIC network, Meta shut down an Iran-based network focused on the Israel-Hamas conflict, although it did not identify any use of generative AI in that campaign.\nCONTEXT\nMeta and other tech giants have grappled with how to address potential misuse of new AI technologies, especially in elections.\nResearchers have found examples of image generators from companies including OpenAI and Microsoft producing photos with voting-related disinformation, despite those companies having policies against such content.\nThe companies have emphasized digital labeling systems to mark AI-generated content at the time of its creation, although the tools do not work on text and researchers have doubts about their effectiveness.\nWHAT'S NEXT\nMeta faces key tests of its defenses with elections in the European Union in early June and in the United States in November. (This story has been corrected to reflect that this is the first disclosure of text-based generative AI use, not of generative AI use altogether, in paragraph 4)\n(Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Rod Nickel)\n"

        "Text": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock is up an impressive 169% over the last five years. The last week saw the share price soften some 2.4%.\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Meta Platforms achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 22%. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Meta Platforms has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Meta Platforms will grow revenue in the future.\nIt's good to see that Meta Platforms has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 71% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 22%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Meta Platforms better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms that you should be aware of before investing here.\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "One of the hottest stocks among the \"Magnificent Seven\" has been Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). After a rocky performance in 2022, shares in the advertising behemoth soared 194% last year following an impressive return to growth on both the top and bottom lines.\nWhile Meta shares are still up an impressive 22% in 2024, the stock has plunged roughly 12% since the company reported first-quarter earnings on April 24. The reason? Meta's management called for an uptick in spending this year.\nLet's outline the rationale behind the rising expense profile and analyze why now is a good time to buy the dip on Meta stock.\nOne thing investors should understand about Meta is that the company is extremely profitable. Although revenue has consistently performed at a high level, Meta also generates significant operating leverage, which is demonstrated by consistent gross profit margins and free cash flow.\nThis provides Meta with a high degree of financial flexibility -- allowing the company to reinvest excess profits back into the business.\nDuring the company's first-quarter earnings call, management told investors that capital expenditures (capex) in 2024 are expected to be in the range of $35 to $40 billion. Considering that management's previous guidance was in the range of $30 to $37 billion, investors seemed blindsided by the raise.\nThe chart below illustrates Meta's capex trends over the past 10 years. The noticeable uptick in 2022 is mostly attributable to the company's metaverse ambitions -- a business segment that is currently unprofitable for Meta.\nGiven that Meta resorted to mass layoffs and extreme cost reduction efforts to return to profitability last year, I can understand why some investors soured on the company's rising capex outlook.\nHowever, parsing through management's commentary provides a lot of useful detail surrounding why the company is investing so heavily in infrastructure. Namely, Meta is developing its own semiconductor chips in-house. The company's Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) chip is an attempt to move away from its current provider: Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPU).\nKeep in mind that Meta owns several leading social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Moreover, the company faces intense competition from the likes of Alphabet's YouTube as well as TikTok -- a favorite among the Gen Z demographic.\nDeveloping its own chips in-house could provide Meta with a big advantage over its peers. In essence, by internalizing its AI efforts as opposed to outsourcing to a third party such as Nvidia, Meta is able to control the entire spectrum of its tech stack. What this means is that Meta can scrape data from its various social media platforms and more quickly process trends on its own compute protocols.\nKeeping the tech stack closed off to third parties can be lucrative in different ways. First, Meta should be able to process data more quickly. In turn, this could help hone the company's targeted advertising algorithm and allow Meta to push strong campaigns to users, thereby accelerating revenue opportunities.\nThe second (and more obvious) way that Meta can benefit is by developing in-house chips, which should lead to cost savings in the long run as the company will not need to rely on outside parties.\nRight now, Meta stock trades at a price-to-free cash flow of 22.9 -- significantly below its 10-year average. Furthermore, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.5 is notably lower than that of peers such as Alphabet.\nI am encouraged by Meta's decision to internalize its AI roadmap as much as possible. While developing its own chips is going to be a costly endeavor in the near term, I see the long-term benefits as too hard to ignore.\nWith shares cratering since publishing first-quarter earnings, now looks like a great time to take advantage of the sell-off.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have been among the big winners over the last year and a half, but the social media stock's rally hit a wall in April after it fell on its first-quarter earnings report.\nAccording to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Meta stock lost 12% in April. As you can see from the chart below, the stock was actually in positive territory for most of the month before falling sharply at the end of April after its earnings report came out.\nShares of Meta actually bucked the broader trend in the stock market in the first half of the month as investors seemed to fear that tech stocks had become overvalued amid signs that the Fed might delay interest rate cuts.\nHowever, that optimism went by the wayside after the company reported first-quarter earnings on April 24. The stock fell 10.5% the following day, though it had traded down as much as 16%.\nMeta actually topped estimates on a strong quarter, reporting revenue growth of 27% to $36.5 billion, which was ahead of the analyst consensus at $36.2 billion.\nThe company experienced a 20% increase in ad impressions across its family of apps and the average price per ad rose 6%, a sign of increasing demand among advertisers and a strengthening ad market.\nOn the bottom line, Meta's results also impressed as the margins expanded after it reduced headcount last year with several rounds of layoffs. Earnings per share jumped 114% to $4.71, which was ahead of estimates at $4.32.\nWhile investors were pleased with that performance, comments about the rest of the year prompted the sell-off.\nThe company said it would increase its capital expenditures for the year from $30 billion-$37 billion to $35 billion-$40 billion to support its artificial intelligence (AI) investments, and it raised its expense forecast for the year from $94 billion-$99 billion to $96 billion-$99 billion.\nFinally, its second-quarter revenue guide was $36.5 billion-$39 billion, which translated to 24% growth, but the midpoint was below the consensus at $38.29 billion.\nThe sell-off in the stock in response to the increased spend on investments seems like a mistake, but the company's growth rate could slow as the benefit of its job cuts starts to roll off.\nHowever, with the reset in the stock price, the valuation still seems appealing. The social media stock still looks like a good candidate for long-term outperformance.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Katie Paul ",
        "Text": "By Katie Paul\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Meta said on Friday its flagship app Facebook is attracting its highest number of young adults in three years, as it tries to shake the platform's reputation as the bastion of an older generation.\nMore than 40 million U.S. and Canadian adults aged 18 to 29 now check Facebook daily, the social media company said, in its first-ever release of such demographic information. Facebook, whose founder Mark Zuckerberg turned 40 last month, marked its 20th anniversary this year.\nThe growth reflects the company's efforts in the last few years to recapture the attention of young adults who have been flocking to short video app TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance.\nMeta charted \"five quarters of healthy app usage growth\" among young adults, a company spokesperson said.\nAt an event in New York aimed at highlighting how young people use the app, Meta's head of Facebook Tom Alison said the anniversary prompted executives to realize Facebook needed to evolve to stay relevant for the next generation.\n\"Who is Facebook for? Is it for my parents?\" Alison said, citing questions he said he had heard from young adults.\nAlison told Reuters in an interview that young users appeared to be coming to Facebook initially to use sections like Marketplace, Groups and Dating at key moments in their lives, such as when they needed to furnish apartments for the first time.\nWhile most of those sections do not feature ads, their usage was driving engagement broadly, he added.\n\"Once they're on Facebook, they go and they check out stuff that's going on in Feed or from Reels,\" he said, referring to Meta's TikTok-like short video product.\nFacebook, founded in a Harvard University dorm in 2004, spread like wildfire across U.S. college campuses after it launched and quickly became the default mass communications platform for a generation of internet users. The app amassed 50 million users within its first three years and now has 3.2 billion users globally.\nAlong the way, however, it became less attractive to the young users who drive consumer fads and are considered crucial by the advertisers responsible for most of Meta's ad sales.\nOnly about a third of U.S. teens say they use Facebook, according to a survey last year by research organization Pew, a sharp drop compared to previous surveys the group conducted in 2014 and 2015.\nBy comparison, the share of all U.S. adults who say they use Facebook has remained relatively flat since 2016 at around 68%, Pew has said.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Rod Nickel and Shri Navaratnam)\n"

        "Title": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Could Easily Take On More Debt",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n View our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of March 2024 Meta Platforms had US$18.4b of debt, an increase on US$9.93b, over one year. But on the other hand it also has US$58.1b in cash, leading to a US$39.7b net cash position.\nWe can see from the most recent balance sheet that Meta Platforms had liabilities of US$28.1b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$45.2b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$58.1b in cash and US$13.4b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$1.77b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\nHaving regard to Meta Platforms' size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$1.19t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Meta Platforms also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.\nOn top of that, Meta Platforms grew its EBIT by 72% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Meta Platforms can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Meta Platforms may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, Meta Platforms generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 80% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.\nWhile it is always sensible to look at a company's total liabilities, it is very reassuring that Meta Platforms has US$39.7b in net cash. The cherry on top was that in converted 80% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$50b. So we don't think Meta Platforms's use of debt is risky. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Meta Platforms   you should know about.\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. Shareholders may appreciate the recent price jump, but the company still has a way to go before reaching its yearly highs again. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s examine Meta Platforms\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 14% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Meta Platforms today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $559.22, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Meta Platforms\u2019s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company\u2019s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Meta Platforms' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 52%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in META\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on META, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. At Simply Wall St, we found 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms and we think they deserve your attention.\nIf you are no longer interested in Meta Platforms, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Meta (META) is looking to revitalize its Facebook app for users other than your weird Uncle Greg with a fresh push to grab Gen Z\u2019s attention. Facebook head Tom Alison is pitching the social network as a place for young adult users between the ages of 18 and 29 to connect, shop, and keep up with the latest trends.\n\"In order to stay relevant, we have to build for the next generation of social media consumers ... Gen Z,\" Alison said during a creator-centric event in New York City on Friday. \"Our product roadmap is driven by the needs of young adults.\"\nThe 20-year-old social network that turned Meta into a tech powerhouse isn't as popular among teens as its sister app, Instagram. According to Piper Sandler\u2019s latest Taking Stock with Teens survey, just 32% of teens use Facebook each month compared to 80% who use Instagram and 72% who access TikTok.\nBut according to Alison, Facebook is a match for users in their late teens and 20s who are navigating various life changes.\n\u201cAs we were doing a lot of research we saw, for example, when somebody's moving to their first apartment, they're already going to [Facebook] Marketplace. And then they're \u2026 often joining a group in their new college to meet new people,\u201d Alison said.\n\u201cAnd we realized, well, a lot of this kind of stuff is already happening on Facebook. We just need to do a really good job bringing it together.\u201d\nPart of that process has included enticing creators to join the platform by improving both its video efforts via its short-form video platform, Reels, and its search function.\nThe strategy seems to be working so far. According to Alison, Facebook has been growing in the US for several quarters and year over year with young adults. What\u2019s more, people spend 60% of their time on Facebook watching videos.\nFacebook took a rare hit after user numbers declined in Q2 2022 from 2.936 billion monthly active users to 2.934 billion, eliciting predictions that the platform was on a downward trajectory. Since then, however, the social network has grown each quarter from Q3 2022 through Q4 2023. The company didn't report monthly active Facebook users in its latest quarterly report.\nAlison says his team was initially concerned that the updates to the platform could alienate the older users the social network has become associated with.\nThe group, however, has largely taken to the feature improvements, as have the millennials who first joined the social network when it launched in 2014.\n\u201cI do think Facebook has had a unique staying power because we've always been willing to change,\u201d Alison said.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The fact that multiple Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nThe Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$473 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$452. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.\nMeta Platforms insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\nI will like Meta Platforms better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.\nOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at Meta Platforms. In total, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth sold US$3.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.\nLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Meta Platforms insiders own 14% of the company, currently worth about US$157b based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.\nAn insider sold Meta Platforms shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Meta Platforms makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Meta Platforms. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Meta Platforms.\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms' estimated fair value is US$559 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nWith US$476 share price, Meta Platforms appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\nOur fair value estimate is 7.4% higher than Meta Platforms' analyst price target of US$520\nDoes the May share price for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$45.7b\nUS$52.2b\nUS$58.9b\nUS$66.7b\nUS$72.5b\nUS$76.9b\nUS$80.8b\nUS$84.2b\nUS$87.3b\nUS$90.1b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x19\nAnalyst x19\nAnalyst x9\nAnalyst x4\nAnalyst x3\nEst @ 6.11%\nEst @ 4.99%\nEst @ 4.21%\nEst @ 3.66%\nEst @ 3.27%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% \nUS$42.6k\nUS$45.4k\nUS$47.8k\nUS$50.4k\nUS$51.1k\nUS$50.6k\nUS$49.5k\nUS$48.1k\nUS$46.5k\nUS$44.8k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$477b\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$90b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.2%\u2013 2.4%) = US$1.9t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.9t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$941b\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$1.4t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$476, the company appears about fair value at a 15% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Meta Platforms as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.058. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

        "Author": "  Avi Kapoor ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) posted better-than-expected earnings and sales results for its first quarter on April 24.\nThe company reported roughly 3.24 billion Family Daily Active People in the first quarter. That\u2019s up 7% year-over-year. The company said capital spending is likely to increase in future years as its artificial intelligence roadmap is supported.\nThe European Commission reportedly plans to investigate Meta's Facebook and Instagram over concerns regarding Russia disinformation, with suspicions of inadequate moderation.\nSome Meta investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Meta has a dividend yield of 0.46%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 50 cents a share ($2.00 a year).\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Meta, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Meta's $2.00 dividend: $6,000 / $2.00 \u00a0= 3,000 shares\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,317,570 worth of Meta Platforms, or 3,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $2.00 = 600 shares, or $263,514 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\nView more earnings on META\nAlso Read: Jim Cramer: These Airline Stocks \u2018Trade Wildly,\u2019 Edwards Lifesciences \u2018At The Right Level To Buy\u2019\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\nMETA Price Action: Shares of Meta Platforms rose 2.1% to close at $439.19 on Wednesday.\nRead More: These 3 Real Estate Stocks With Over 4% Dividend Yields Are Recommended By Wall Street\u2019s Most Accurate Analysts\nImage: Shutterstock\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Meta Platforms Stock Following Upbeat Q1 Earnings originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "What are the early trends we should look for to identify a stock that could multiply in value over the long term? In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) looks attractive right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Meta Platforms, this is the formula:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.29 = US$56b \u00f7 (US$223b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nSo, Meta Platforms has an ROCE of 29%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 6.4%.\n View our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Meta Platforms compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Meta Platforms .\nWe'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Meta Platforms. The company has consistently earned 29% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 96% in that time. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.\nIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 159% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So even though the stock might be more \"expensive\" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.\nLike most companies, Meta Platforms does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.\nMeta Platforms is not the only stock earning high returns.

        "Author": "  James Foord ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) first-quarter earnings report last week triggered a drastic market reaction, with shares plummeting 10.50% by the end of Thursday's trading session, resulting in a staggering $130 billion loss in market capitalization. This decline sharply contrasted with the over 20% surge seen after the previous earnings release, marking the largest single-day market cap gain ever recorded.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META.\nInterestingly, the sell-off was not prompted by an earnings miss. The social media giant actually surpassed the earnings per share consensus by a robust 9% and revenue by $240 million. The primary concerns seemed to stem from guidance, which was perceived as somewhat conservative, along with management's plan to significantly increase investments in artificial intelligence.\nMeta continues to stand out as a pivotal player in the tech and advertising landscape. With an estimated 3.2 billion global users engaging daily across its platforms, the company's reach is truly astounding.\nWhat's even more notable is the company's consistent growth in user numbers, which expanded by a remarkable 7% year over year. This growth was fueled by gains across Meta's diverse suite of platforms, highlighting its ongoing relevance and expansion in the digital space.\nDuring the first quarter, Meta also achieved notable growth in user engagement, resulting in a 20% increase in ad impressions. This advancement is visually captured in the accompanying graph, illustrating a steady year-over-year uptrend in average revenue per user.\nThis dual achievement signifies Meta's success in expanding both its user base and the value derived from each user, demonstrating an impressive growth trajectory for the company.\nIn the short term, Meta anticipates a decline in free cash flows due to aggressive capital spending, particularly in AI development. The company projects full-year expenses of $96 billion to $99 billion and capital expenditures of $35 billion to $40 billion, with a $5 billion increase at the lower end of the guidance range. The heightened investment in AI initiatives is expected to result in lower free cash flow margins.\nDespite the near-term impact on cash flows, I do not view these AI investments as a reason for the market's negative reaction. Instead, I believe these strategic investments could unlock new revenue opportunities over the long term, contributing to Meta's growth trajectory.\nAdditionally, the company's revenue guidance for the year disappointed investors, with projected top-line figures of $36.50 billion to $39 billion. While this guidance suggests up to 22% year-over-year revenue growth, some investors may have had higher expectations, leading to the market's reaction with a 16% drop in shares.\nMeta has stood out as one of the top performers among the Magnificent Seven, trailing only behind Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA). Despite concerns over its valuation climbing too swiftly, I believe these worries are more a reflection of human psychology than the underlying business fundamentals. Any potential losses in tomorrow's trading are likely to be short-lived, especially once the somewhat tangential effects of the Federal Reserve's prolonged stance on interest rates become clearer.\nMeta's competitive edge is resilient against higher interest rates, and its valuation reflects expectations of sustained competitiveness over decades. The decision to ramp up capital expenditures during a period of exceptional growth is, in my view, a strategic move by management rather than a signal to sell this exceptional stock.\nThere are numerous reasons to anticipate that Meta will continue surpassing expectations and delivering value to shareholders. The company is entering the AI race more competitively, facing off against giants like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). However, what sets Meta apart, even compared to Nvidia, is its exceptional margins, making it a standout among the Magnificent Seven.\nMeta has entered the competition with ChatGPT by launching its Llama3 large language model, signaling its commitment to AI innovation and positioning itself among the major beneficiaries of the trend. The future of the technology remains uncertain, but Meta is aggressively pursuing a leading role in this evolving landscape.\nThroughout 2023, Meta implemented significant cost-cutting measures, marking it as the \"year of efficiency,\" a move that resonated well with both the markets and shareholders.\nThe company's substantial capital expenditure into augmented reality and the Metaverse is expected to leverage its existing AI capabilities. By integrating open-source aspects of its AI stack, Meta aims to develop new functionalities as technology advances.\nMeta's strong economic foothold in the U.S. is another key positive factor. Given its concentration in digital advertising, the company's performance is closely aligned with overall economic activity.\nMoreover, unlike previous economic expansions, businesses are currently deleveraging on a net basis, creating a favorable environment for Meta's operations and growth prospects.\nFollowing the latest sell-off, META has become very attractive, and there is plenty of upside if we look at a simple discounted cash flow model.\nAssuming Meta can keep growing at around 15% per year and maintain its current margins, then this model implies 46% undervaluation.\nMeta's financial stability is heavily reliant on digital advertising spending. Any reduction in this spending, particularly due to economic weakness, could negatively impact the stock. However, amidst the ongoing AI competition, the company faces significant risks, including potential major product setbacks similar to Google's recent experience with Gemini. Despite these challenges, I believe macroeconomic risks, especially given Meta's cost-cutting efforts and AI's potential to enhance its core product rapidly, pose the greatest concerns.\nAdditionally, various economic risks could disrupt the market, including:\nFed policy errors.\nEscalation of the banking crisis.\nReturn of inflation.\nCommercial real estate market collapse.\nPrivate asset write-downs.\nIncreased political uncertainty during an election year.\nRising interest rates or extended higher rates could dampen the performance of high-multiple stocks. Nevertheless, Meta appears less vulnerable to this given the strength of its customer base and the potential for improved product economics through AI integration.\nMeta's first fiscal quarter earnings sheet revealed a strong performance, indicating the enduring nature of the digital advertising rebound that began in 2023. The company retains significant advertising relevance for marketers and managed to accelerate its top-line growth. Notably, it was a standout quarter for Meta in terms of free cash flow, with margins exceeding 34%.\nI believe the market has reacted excessively to Meta's expansion into AI, which should not be seen as a negative. Although the price-earnings ratio is less than 20, indicating it is not entirely cheap, the company's growing revenues, earnings and free cash flow justify this valuation for the largest U.S.-based social media company.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

The fund increased 12.6% (Institutional Shares) in the first quarter compared to an 11.4% gain for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and a 10.6% increase for the S&P 500 Index. Despite higher interest rates, the US economy continues to surpass expectations. In addition, please check the fund\u2019s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund highlighted stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), in the first quarter 2024 investor letter. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a technology company that develops products to connect people. The one-month return of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was 10.54%, and its shares gained 82.50% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On May 24, 2024, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock closed at $430.16 per share with a market capitalization of $3.197 trillion.\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\"Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the world\u2019s largest social network, rose 37.3% in the quarter due to robust fourth quarter top-line growth of 25% year-over-year with operating margins more than doubling year-over-year to 41%, benefiting from the year of efficiency12 as Meta\u2019s headcount was down 22% year-over-year (note that the profitability of the core business is even stronger as Reality Labs\u2019 losses of over $4.5 billion in the quarter are included in the overall operating income metric). Meta also guided for first-quarter revenue growth of approximately 29% year-over-year, which was better than expected. Advertiser satisfaction and adoption of Meta remains strong, core app engagement is healthy with video daily watch time up 25% year-over-year and the total number of monthly active users up 6% year-on-year to 3.98 billion in the fourth quarter, and Instagram Reels and click-to-message ads monetization continues to improve. Meta also continues to rapidly innovate in GenAI, with its leading research lab releasing widely adopted open-source models (e.g., Llama 2), and internal algorithms and core apps becoming augmented with AI (e.g., Meta\u2019s recommendation engine). We remain shareholders and believe Meta can sustain its leading market share in digital advertising thanks to strong network effects enabled by its massive user and advertiser base. Additionally, we believe the company\u2019s innovative culture, large installed base, and leading GenAI research should enable it to embed AI and GenAI into its offerings with further monetization opportunities ahead. For example, AI agents could help scale business messaging, handling a large volume of customer requests on behalf of business customers, making business messaging at scale more viable.\"\nMeta Platforms, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) trailing 12 months revenue is $142.71 billion and its year over year quarterly revenue growth rate is 27.30% and earnings growth rate is 116.70%.\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

        "Title": "Tech Giants Alphabet And Meta Pay Dividends Now - But Are They Worth It?",
        "Author": "  Aditi Ganguly ",
        "Text": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nTech behemoths are known for their stellar growth potential, which results in significant capital gains. However, they are typically not popular with investors seeking dividend payouts for steady passive income.\nNonetheless, in a significant move reflecting a shift in strategy and a maturing stage of growth, both Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) have announced plans to pay dividends to their shareholders alongside massive share buyback programs.\nMeta Platforms, formerly Facebook, took the market by storm with its announcement of a quarterly dividend payment of $0.20 per share for the first time in its history back in February. The social media giant also revealed an expanded $50 billion share buyback program.\nThis decision came as Meta reported financials for the last quarter of 2023 exceeded expectations. Revenues amounted to $40.1 billion, surpassing the Wall Street estimate of $39.18 billion. Furthermore, the company's bottom line came in at $5.33, beating the consensus estimate of $4.96.\n\"Introducing a dividend just gives us a more balanced capital return program and some added flexibility in how we return capital in the future,\" said Susan Li, Meta Platforms CFO.\nSimilarly, Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, unveiled its plans to pay its first-ever dividend of $0.20 per share last month, alongside a massive $70 billion share buyback program. This decision followed Alphabet\u2019s impressive first-quarter results, which surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations.\nAlphabet's total revenues amounted to $80.54 billion in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, marking the fastest growth since 2022. EPS came in at $1.89, surpassing the consensus analyst estimate of $1.89.\nDividends signify a shift in the companies\u2019 approach, from solely focusing on growth to also prioritizing returning value to shareholders.\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These three reliable high-yield ETFs will put your income investments on autopilot.\nMiami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city with as little as $500 before that happens.\nMeta Platforms announced its first-quarter earnings results during the last week of April.\u00a0 However, the market reception of the tech giant's stellar growth was underwhelming. The company's revenues grew 27% year-over-year to $28.65 billion, marking the fastest quarterly growth since 2021.\nMeta's projected sales for the second quarter range between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. The midpoint of this range, at $37.75 billion, reflects an 18% year-over-year growth rate, falling short of analysts\u2019 average prediction of $38.3 billion.\nDuring the earnings call, Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted initiatives such as advancements in glasses and mixed reality, areas where the company currently lacks profitability. He also emphasized the escalating investments in artificial intelligence. However, this resulted in a steep sell-off, as META stock fell by 16% intraday on April 24.\nFor years, investors have been drawn to tech stocks like Meta and Alphabet for their growth potential. While dividends offer a steady income stream, they may not match the exponential growth that these companies have historically provided. Moreover, the tech stalwarts don't have a steady history of paying dividends, which might deter investors who seek reliable quarterly dividend payouts.\nWhile Meta and Alphabet\u2019s decision to pay dividends is a significant shift in their strategies, it\u2019s important to note that these payouts are unlikely to amount to substantial returns in the form of income for investors. Meta\u2019s forward dividend yield currently stands at a mere 0.11%, while Alphabet\u2019s is only slightly higher at 0.12%. These low yields indicate that both companies are still very much focused on growth rather than providing meaningful income to shareholders.\nFor investors who want to capture the growth potential of Meta and Alphabet while also generating steady income, diversifying their portfolios with real estate investments could be an attractive option.\nReal estate has historically been one of the most reliable sources of income for investors but is traditionally far from a passive investment when you consider all of the management responsibilities involved. However, a company backed by Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos has created a real estate investment platform that allows retail investors to buy shares of carefully selected rental properties. The best part is you can invest with as little as $100.\nArrived takes on all of the landlord responsibilities while investors simply collect monthly dividends from the rental income while the properties appreciate in value over time. The platform has already funded over 370 properties and has paid out more than $5.6 million in dividends. The process to sign up and become a partner in a single-family rental only takes about 10 minutes.\nClick here to view properties currently available on Arrived.\nDiversifying with private market real estate can help investors balance their portfolios, combining the growth potential of tech giants like Meta and Alphabet with the stability and income-generating capabilities of rental properties. This approach can provide a more well-rounded investment strategy, catering to both long-term growth and steady income generation.\nWant to explore more private market real estate options?

        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with META.\nAs of 2024-05-27, Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $548.47. It's currently trading at a price of $478.22. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 12.81%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$17.55\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.47%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 35.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n622.62\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n930.79\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n548.47\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $588.03. This valuation indicates that the Meta Platforms Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 18.67%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg faces a potential revolt at the company\u2019s annual meeting on Wednesday as shareholders push the Big Tech firm to step up transparency regarding its efforts to protect kids online.\nA group led by Lisette Cooper, vice chair of the Franklin Templeton subsidiary Fiduciary Trust International and the parent of a child sex abuse survivor, is backing a non-binding resolution urging Meta\u2019s board to publish an annual report tracking the company\u2019s performance on child safety and protecting young users from harm on its apps.\nThe report would require \u201cquantitative metrics appropriate to assessing whether Meta has improved its performance globally regarding child safety impacts and actual harm reduction to children on its platforms.\u201d\n\u201cIf they want to reassure advertisers, parents, legislators, shareholders on whether they\u2019re making a different on dealing with this problem on harm to children, they need to have transparency,\u201d Cooper said in an interview with The Post. \u201cThey need better metrics.\u201d\nThe resolution is set for a vote during a time of intense scrutiny for Zuckerberg-led Meta \u2013 which faces a legal and regulatory crackdown in the US and abroad about its alleged failure to keep kids safe on Instagram and Facebook.\nZuckerberg himself recently apologized to the families of victims of online sex abuse during a high-profile Congressional hearing.\nMeta\u2019s board of directors opposes the resolution, arguing in an April proxy statement that the \u201crequested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders.\u201d\nCooper and her allies cite a raft of pending litation against Meta related to child safety. Last October, Meta was sued by dozens of states who alleged that the company had \u201cignored the sweeping damage these platforms have caused to the mental and physical health,\u201d including poor sleep, disruption to schoolwork, anxiety and depression.\nA separate suit from New Mexico\u2019s attorney general alleged Meta has exposed underage users to purported sex predators.\nAs The Post reported earlier this month, Meta is also spearheading a massive lobbying campaign to kill or weaken a pair of New York bills aimed at protecting kids online.\n\u201cChildren are going to be the users of the future. If they have a bad experience on the platform, they are not going to keep coming back. This makes a huge difference to us as investors,\u201d Cooper added.\nTwo of the largest proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co. have recommended shareholders vote in favor of the resolution.\n\u201cWe believe that the requested report and the adoption and reporting of targets will provide shareholders with valuable information, so they can better understand this sensitive issue in the context of the Company\u2019s efforts to minimize harmful content on its platforms,\u201d Glass Lewis said regarding the proposal.\nISS determined that \u201cshareholders would benefit from additional information on how the company is managing the risks related to child safety.\u201d\nShareholder resolutions are essentially doomed without the support of Zuckerberg, who controls 61% of the company\u2019s voting power through his ownership of so-called super voting Class B shares.\nProxy Impact, which filed the resolution on Cooper\u2019s behalf, noted in a filing that a similar proposal at last year\u2019s annual meeting received nearly 54% support from shares that weren\u2019t controlled by Meta management.\n\u201cThis is like a basic first step for any business plan \u2013 get the data,\u201d said Proxy Impact CEO Michael Passoff. \u201cWhat gets measured gets managed, and they\u2019re not doing that. Or if they are, they just aren\u2019t making it available to anyone.\u201d\nIn its proxy filing, Meta noted various steps it has taken to address online child safety concerns, including the creation of \u201cmore than 30 tools across our apps to help support teens and families\u201d and existing policies that prohibit harmful content that seeks to exploit kids.\n\u201cWe want people, especially young people, to foster their online relationships in a safe, positive, and supportive environment, and we work closely with a broad range of stakeholders to inform our approach to safety,\u201d the company said.\nMeta\u2019s board also recommended that shareholders reject a number of other resolutions, including one requesting a third-party report that would assess the \u201cpotential risks and benefits of instituting a higher minimum age for users of its social media products.\u201d\nMeta\u2019s legal and regulatory headaches on the issue of child safety aren\u2019t limited to the US.\nEarlier this month, the European Commission revealed it was investigating whether Meta had violated a sweeping new law called the Digital Service Act, which requires the largest tech firms to police content on their platforms.\nEuropean watchdogs expressed concern that Facebook and Instagram \u201cmay stimulate behavioral addictions in children\u201d as well as \u201crabbit-hole effects,\u201d where kids stay glued to the apps despite harmful health effects.\nMeta could face fines of up to 6% of its annual revenue if it is found to have violated the DSA.\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have held discussions with major Hollywood studios about licensing content for use in the tech giants\u2019 artificial intelligence video generation software, according to people familiar with the matter.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nWall Street Returns to T+1 Stock Trading After a Century\nWorld\u2019s Largest Nuclear Plant Sits Idle While Energy Needs Soar\nNew BYD Hybrid Can Drive Non-Stop for More Than 2,000 Kilometers\n\u2018Not Gonna Be Pretty:\u2019 Covid-Era Homebuyers Face Huge Rate Jump\nTreasuries Hit as US Sales Struggle to Lure Buyers: Markets Wrap\nBoth companies are developing technology that can create realistic scenes from a text prompt, and have offered tens of millions of dollars to partner with studios in some capacity. Rival OpenAI, backed by Microsoft Corp., is having similar conversations. Alphabet, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment on the talks.\nHollywood studios are keen to discuss ways to use AI to reduce costs while also protecting themselves from having their work stolen. They are wary of giving films and TV shows to tech companies without control over how that content is used. Just this week, the actress Scarlett Johansson demanded OpenAI stop using a voice that sounded like her to power its chatbot after she refused to work with the company.\nBig money is at stake. On Wednesday, News Corp., parent of the Wall Street Journal and other media outlets, agreed to allow OpenAI to use content from more than a dozen of its publications in a deal that could be worth more than $250 million over five years.\nWarner Bros. Discovery Inc. has expressed a willingness to license some of its programs to train the models, but only for specific divisions \u2014 not its entire library. Walt Disney Co. and Netflix Inc. aren\u2019t willing to license their content to these companies, but have expressed an interest in other types of collaborations.\nHollywood studios are already using artificial intelligence in production, as are many filmmakers. Tyler Perry has used the technology to re-create the makeup he wears for his Madea character in movies. Director Robert Zemeckis has deployed artificial intelligence to de-age Tom Hanks in an upcoming film.\nBut a new crop of tools, including OpenAI\u2019s Sora and Alphabet\u2019s Veo, go a step further by promising to help filmmakers quickly create vivid, hyper-realistic clips based on just a few words of description. Their capabilities have elicited excitement and anxiety in Hollywood, where actors and writers staged a monthslong strike last year over concern about how AI could take their jobs.\nPerry, an actor, filmmaker and studio owner, was so amazed by a demonstration of Sora that he put plans for an $800 million studio expansion on hold earlier this year. He has been vocal about the opportunities AI represents for studios, but also in raising the alarm about the technology\u2019s impact on labor. He has called for the industry to rally together and formulate some sort of regulations. \u201cIf not, I just don\u2019t see how we survive,\u201d he told the Hollywood Reporter in February.\nThe music industry has adopted a tough stance against AI use. Universal Music Group NV sued Anthropic, a budding AI startup, for copying song lyrics and temporarily pulled its music from TikTok in part to secure protections for its artists. Sony Music Group sent letters to hundreds of partners this month warning them not to train any AI models on its music.\nNo major studio has so far sued a tech company over AI, despite fears that many of these models have already been trained on their copyrighted material. They would like to find a way to make AI work for them rather than fight a new technology that could help significantly reshape the industry. But studios have yet to agree to major commercial relationships around the use of AI with the largest technology companies.\nHollywood executives worry that licensing conversations will lead to tension between studios and their creative partners. For example, studios believe they have the rights to license a movie they own to an AI company. But if that company uses the movie to train its AI model on the face or voice of an actor in that movie, the actor would also want the opportunity to approve of it or not. A few actors have already struck deals with AI companies.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nNew York\u2019s Biggest Produce Market Is at a Breaking Point\nWhy Dave & Buster\u2019s Is Transforming Its Arcades Into Casinos\nElon Musk Still Has Friends in Silicon Valley\nWhen Business Is Just a Game\nThe Six Choke Points That Can Upend Global Trade\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Meta Shareholders Represented by Proxy Impact\u2014Including Lead Filer Lisette Cooper, PhD, Vice Chair of Fiduciary Trust International\u2014Seek to Protect Children and the Long-Term Financial Performance of Meta\nNEW YORK, May 21, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fiduciary Trust International, a global wealth manager and wholly-owned subsidiary of Franklin Templeton, announces that Meta shareholder Lisette Cooper, PhD, vice chair, has filed a resolution for shareholders to vote upon at Meta\u2019s annual meeting in Menlo Park, CA on May 29, 2024.\nThe proposal, filed on behalf of Dr. Cooper and other Meta shareholders by Proxy Impact, calls on Meta\u2019s Board of Directors to, within one year, adopt targets for reducing dangers and threats to children on its global social media platforms, as well as quantitative metrics for assessing the company\u2019s improvement in this area. The resolution also calls for Meta\u2019s Board of Directors to ensure these targets and performance metrics are published in an annual report, enabling investors and stakeholders to judge how effective Meta\u2019s tools, policies, and actions for protecting children have been.\nInstitutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis, the two largest proxy advisory services, both recommend voting for the resolution.\n\"Meta is the largest social media company in the world, with billions of users, but its platforms\u2014including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp\u2014have been shown to pose a variety of physical and psychological risks to children and teens,\" said Lisette Cooper, PhD, vice chair of Fiduciary Trust International. \"As a parent, and an investor, with a deep personal connection to this issue, I support this shareholder resolution as a meaningful step to encourage Meta\u2019s leadership to do more to protect the young people who use its platforms\u2014which we believe will also protect the long-term security of shareholders\u2019 investments.\"\nMeta\u2019s social media platforms have been linked to many dangers to the physical and mental wellbeing of children and teenagers. These range from sextortion, grooming, and human trafficking to cyberbullying, harassment, exposure to sexual or violent content, depression, anxiety, self-harm, and self-image distortion.\nThe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reported that its CyberTipline received nearly 36 million reports of online exploitation of children in 2023, including child sexual abuse material, child sex trafficking, and online enticement\u2014and almost 31 million of them came from Meta platforms.\nA Wall Street Journal investigation published in June 2023 found that Meta\u2019s algorithms for Instagram guide pedophiles to sellers of child sexual abuse materials, essentially \"connecting a vast pedophile network.\"\nMeta has also begun end-to-end encryption of Facebook Messenger, despite warnings from law enforcement and child safety organizations that doing so will hide millions of reports of child sexual abuse materials\u2014masking the actions of predators, and making children more vulnerable.\nIn the wake of the U.S. Surgeon General\u2019s Advisory on social media and youth mental health, 42 U.S. state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against Meta, claiming Facebook and Instagram algorithms are designed to intentionally make the platforms addictive, and that they harm young people\u2019s mental health.\nIn September 2022, Meta was fined \u20ac405 million, or just over $400 million, by Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission for not safeguarding children\u2019s information on Instagram.\n\"The Internet is like the Wild West for children and teens. Meta and other social media companies need to do more to prevent their technology from being weaponized against their youngest users,\" said Michael Passoff, chief executive officer of Proxy Impact. \"The more tech companies try to evade responsibility for the harm caused by algorithms designed to maximize user engagement, the more the world is fighting back. Shareholders in Meta and other social media companies can make an enormous difference by raising their voices against business practices that treat children as collateral damage.\"\nIf Meta does not sufficiently address child safety issues, it faces potential financial, regulatory, and legal penalties under new legislation in the U.S., U.K., and European Union.\nThe E.U.\u2019s Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act, which went into effect in February 2024, will require companies like Meta to identify, report, and remove child sexual abuse materials.\nThe U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act of 2023 includes measures to keep children and other online users safe from harmful and fraudulent content.\nIn this country, the REPORT Act was signed into law on May 7, 2024. The legislation will strengthen the capabilities of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children\u2019s national tipline to collect reports of online exploitation, and require the reports and evidence to be preserved for a longer period\u2014thereby giving law enforcement more time to investigate and prosecute.\nDr. Cooper\u2019s daughter Sarah is a founding member of the Brave Movement and has been deeply involved in the Heat Initiative\u2019s campaign as a survivor/lived experience expert. She is a survivor of child sexual abuse by an older man who misrepresented himself on Facebook Messenger. Sarah Cooper has spoken at two of Meta\u2019s previous annual meetings.\nDr. Cooper is also a member of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility\u2019s working group on child safety and technology. Since 2019, Proxy Impact and Dr. Cooper have worked with members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility to empower investors to utilize their leverage to encourage Meta and other tech companies to strengthen child safety measures on social media.\nAbout Fiduciary Trust International\nFiduciary Trust International, a global wealth management firm headquartered in New York, NY, has served individuals, families, endowments and foundations since 1931.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)). and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), as well as two micro-cap stocks HF Foods Group Inc. (HFFG) and Blue Dolphin Energy Company (BDCO) The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>NVIDIA has literally become the post child for AI leverage, which can be seen in the company's blockbuster stock marekt performance (+173.9% vs. +134.0% for the chips industry). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+87.0% vs. +44.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.Meta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 150 million monthly actives.Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)Exxon Mobil shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+12.1% vs. +11.9%). The company is a reliable player in the energy sector, boasts a resilient capital structure and a track record of prudent capex management. Its strategic discoveries in the Stabroek Block and Permian Basin promise growth and lower greenhouse gas intensity.With a robust balance sheet, ExxonMobil prioritizes shareholder returns, evidenced by substantial buybacks and the strategic acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. The company aims to increase its annual share buybacks to $20 billion through 2025.However, challenges loom, notably in the upstream operations, which are susceptible to volatile oil prices and regulatory hurdles. While committed to shareholders, ExxonMobil faces scrutiny for lagging industry peers in terms of dividend yield. Reliance on finding economically recoverable reserves and exposure to OPEC production cuts add to uncertainties.(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)Shares of HF Foods have underperformed the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (-4.9% vs. -3.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $165.72 million is facing challenges which includes high debt levels, low net profit margins, declining cash flow, and inventory management issues. Dependence on the Asian restaurant market, exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and geopolitical risks pose concerns.The impact of exiting the chicken processing business and the risks associated with transformation initiatives persist. Nevertheless, HF Foods\u2019 revenues increased 0.6% year over year in first-quarter 2024 despite exiting its chicken processing business in 2023.Profitability improved significantly, with net loss narrowing and adjusted EBITDA increasing. Cost control measures, such as centralized purchasing, fleet enhancements, and digital transformation, are driving efficiencies. With a strong liquidity position, HF Foods is well-positioned for strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to expand its footprint.(You can read the full research report on HF Foods here >>>)Blue Dolphin Energy\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry over the past year (+104.9% vs. +17.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $94.75 million is operating in the strategic Eagle Ford Shale region, offers a robust investment option with its established market presence and considerable infrastructure, including a 15,000-barrel-per-day refinery and more than 1.25 million barrels of storage.Financially, it managed costs effectively, reducing goods sold from $96.2 million in first-quarter 2023 to $79.2 million in first-quarter 2024, and secured a $5-million credit facility for liquidity.However, risks include heavy reliance on refining margins, which saw first-quarter 2024 revenues drop to $91 million from $116.7 million the previous year, and high customer concentration, with 89% of 2023 revenues from two main customers. Moreover, persistent debt issues, significant default amounts, and concerns over affiliate transactions further cloud its financial stability.(You can read the full research report on Blue Dolphin Energy here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today Philip Morris International Inc.

        "Author": "  Sharon Goldman ",
        "Text": "Generative AI is on the ballot at Big Tech companies like Meta and Alphabet, as shareholders vote on proposals calling for detailed reports by the companies about how the technology is being used to create and spread misinformation. The shareholder proposals, which will be voted on at each company\u2019s upcoming annual general meeting, reflect growing concerns about the power and prevalence of generative AI.\nThe votes come as Google has faced massive blowback over the past week for its new search AI features, which has produced false and often bizarre responses, including telling users to put glue on pizza. Audio and video deepfakes created by AI technology are also proliferating online, raising concerns in an election year.\nShareholders in Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, will vote at the company\u2019s annual meeting on Wednesday, while investors in Google-parent company Alphabet will weigh in at the company\u2019s annual meeting on June 7. The resolutions come just a few months after a similar proposal at Microsoft\u2019s AGM on December 7, 2023, which was presented by Nirvana co-founder and bassist Krist Novoselic and garnered 21% of the shareholder vote.\nThe three proposals were led by ESG activist investor group Arjuna Capital and focus on concerns that generative AI threatens to amplify misinformation and disinformation around the world, particularly during a critical election year in countries like the US and India. A separate shareholder proposal brought to Apple focused on the risks of AI to workers, which was filed by the AFL-CIO Equity Index Funds, the largest labor union federation in the US. While the proposal was ultimately voted down by Apple shareholders at its annual meeting in February, proponents of AI transparency won a victory beforehand when the SEC ruled that companies like Apple could not bar shareholders from voting on such matters.\nIn the proxy statement for Meta's annual meeting, the shareholder proposal states that \"with Meta\u2019s recent development of gAI products, including conversational assistants and advertising tools, the company is increasingly at risk from misinformation and disinformation generated through its own products.\"\nThe proposal calls for the Meta board to \u201cissue a report, at reasonable cost, omitting proprietary or legally privileged information, to be published within one year of the Annual Meeting and updated annually thereafter, assessing the risks to the Company\u2019s operations and finances, and to public welfare, presented by the Company\u2019s role in facilitating misinformation and disinformation disseminated or generated via generative Artificial Intelligence; what steps the Company plans to take to remediate those harms; and how it will measure the effectiveness of such efforts.\u201d\nIn its response urging shareholders to reject the proposal, Meta pointed to its \u201cfive pillars of Responsible AI\u201d which are overseen by its board of directors, as well as its investments in safety and security efforts to combat misinformation and disinformation.\n\u201cGiven our ongoing efforts to address this topic, the board of directors believes that the requested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders,\u201d the Proxy Report said.\nIn a response to a similar proposal, Alphabet said that its Board of Directors recommended a vote against the stockholder proposal because \u201cOur enterprise risk frameworks, product policies, and tools provide a foundation for identifying and mitigating AI-generated mis/disinformation and other potential risks,\u201d adding that \u201cwe continually strive to improve the quality of our generative AI models and applications through both pre-launch testing and ongoing fine-tuning, and we are transparent about our ongoing work via public reporting.\u201d\nThe proposals for AI reports at Meta and Alphabet are unlikely to be approved, as both companies have dual class stock that concentrates the voting power in the hands of the founders. Still, the proposals carry symbolic power and have the potential to send a message to management if they earn widespread support from shareholders.\nAt December\u2019s Microsoft AGM, Novoselic served as the spokesperson for the shareholder initiative, describing himself as a long-time shareholder. He accused the company of racing forward, \u201creleasing this nascent technology without the appropriate guardrails.\u201d Generative AI, he continued, \u201cis a game-changer, there\u2019s no question, but the rush to market seemingly prioritizes short term profits over long-term success.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  BARBARA ORTUTAY ",
        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 If you use Facebook, WhatsApp or Instagram, you've probably noticed a new character pop up answering search queries or eagerly offering tidbits of information in your feeds, with varying degrees of accuracy.\nIt's Meta AI, and it's here to help, at least according to Meta Platforms' CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who calls it \u201cthe most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\u201d\nThe chatbot can recommend local restaurants, offer more information on something you see in a Facebook post, search for airline flights or generate images in the blink of an eye. If you're chatting with friends to plan a night out, you can invite it into your group conversation by typing @MetaAI, then ask it to recommend, say, cocktail bars.\nMeta\u2019s AI tool has been integrated into chat boxes and search bars throughout the tech giant\u2019s platforms. The assistant appears, for example, at the top of your chat list on Messenger. Ask it questions about anything or to \u201cimagine\u201d something and it will generate a picture or animation.\nAs with any new technology, there are, of course, hiccups, including bizarre exchanges when the chatbots first started engaging with real people. One joined a Facebook moms\u2019 group to talk about its gifted child. Another tried to give away nonexistent items to confused members of a Buy Nothing forum.\nMeta AI hasn't been universally welcomed. Here are some tips if you want to avoid using it:\nCAN I TURN IT OFF?\nSome Facebook users don't like the chatbot, complaining in online forums that they're tired of having AI foisted on them all the time or that they just want to stick with what they know. So what if you don't want Meta AI butting in every time you search for something or scroll through your social feeds? Well, you might need a time machine. Meta and other tech companies are in an AI arms race, churning out new language models and persuading \u2014 some might say pressuring \u2014 the public to use them.\nThe bad news is there's no one button to turn off Meta AI on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp. However, if you want to limit it, there are some (imperfect) workarounds.\nMUTE...SORT OF\nOn the Facebook mobile app, tap the \u201csearch\u201d button. You may get a prompt to \u201cAsk Meta AI anything.\u201d Tap the blue triangle on the right, then the blue circle with an \u201ci\u201d inside it. Here, you'll see a \u201cmute\u201d button, with options to silence the chatbot for 15 minutes or longer, or \u201cUntil I change it.\u201d You can do the same on Instagram.\nNonetheless, muting doesn't get rid of Meta AI completely. Meta AI's circle logo might still appear where the search magnifying glass used to be \u2014 and tapping on it will take you to the Meta AI field. This is now the new way to search in Meta, and just as with Google's AI summaries, the responses will be generated by AI.\nI asked the chatbot about searching Facebook without Meta AI results.\n\u201cMeta AI aims to be a helpful assistant and is in the search bar to assist with your questions,\" it responded. Then it added, \"You can't disable it from this experience, but you can tap the search button after writing your query and search how you normally would.\u201d\nThen I asked a (human) Meta spokesperson.\n\u201cYou can search how you normally would and choose to engage with a variety of results \u2014 ones from Meta AI or others that appear as you type,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \"And when interacting with Meta AI, you have access to real-time information without having to leave the app you\u2019re using thanks to our search partnerships.\u201d\nLike an over-eager personal assistant, Meta AI also pops up under posts on your Facebook news feed, offering more information about what\u2019s discussed in the post \u2014 such as the subject of a news article. It\u2019s not possible to disable this feature, so you'll just have to ignore it.\nUSE OLD SCHOOL FACEBOOK\nTech websites have noted that one surefire way to avoid Facebook's AI assistant is to use the social network's stripped-down mobile site, mbasic.facebook.com. It's aimed at people in developing countries using older phones on slower internet connections. The basic site has a retro feel that looks crude compared to the current version, and it looks even worse on desktop browsers, but it still works on a rudimentary level and without AI.\nOTHER COUNTRIES\nMeta AI is so far only available in the United States and 13 other countries including Australia, Canada, Ghana, Jamaica, Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. So if you don't live in any of those places, you don't have to worry about the chatbot because you don't get to use it. At least not yet.\n"

NVDA, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, HF Foods Group Inc. HFFG and Blue Dolphin Energy Co. BDCO.\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp., Meta Platforms, Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corp., as well as two micro-cap stocks HF Foods Group Inc. and Blue Dolphin Energy Co. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here >>>NVIDIA has literally become the post child for AI leverage, which can be seen in the company's blockbuster stock market performance (+173.9% vs. +134.0% for the chips industry). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+87.0% vs. +44.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.Meta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 150 million monthly actives.Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)Exxon Mobil shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (+12.1% vs. +11.9%). The company is a reliable player in the energy sector, boasts a resilient capital structure and a track record of prudent capex management. Its strategic discoveries in the Stabroek Block and Permian Basin promise growth and lower greenhouse gas intensity.With a robust balance sheet, ExxonMobil prioritizes shareholder returns, evidenced by substantial buybacks and the strategic acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. The company aims to increase its annual share buybacks to $20 billion through 2025.However, challenges loom, notably in the upstream operations, which are susceptible to volatile oil prices and regulatory hurdles. While committed to shareholders, ExxonMobil faces scrutiny for lagging industry peers in terms of dividend yield. Reliance on finding economically recoverable reserves and exposure to OPEC production cuts add to uncertainties.(You can read the full research report on Exxon Mobil here >>>)Shares of HF Foods have underperformed the Zacks Food - Miscellaneous industry over the past year (-4.9% vs. -3.9%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $165.72 million is facing challenges which include high debt levels, low net profit margins, declining cash flow, and inventory management issues. Dependence on the Asian restaurant market, exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and geopolitical risks pose concerns.The impact of exiting the chicken processing business and the risks associated with transformation initiatives persist. Nevertheless, HF Foods' revenues increased 0.6% year over year in first-quarter 2024 despite exiting its chicken processing business in 2023.Profitability improved significantly, with net loss narrowing and adjusted EBITDA increasing. Cost control measures, such as centralized purchasing, fleet enhancements, and digital transformation, are driving efficiencies. With a strong liquidity position, HF Foods is well-positioned for strategic mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to expand its footprint.(You can read the full research report on HF Foods here >>>)Blue Dolphin Energy's shares have outperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry over the past year (+104.9% vs. +17.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $94.75 million is operating in the strategic Eagle Ford Shale region, offers a robust investment option with its established market presence and considerable infrastructure, including a 15,000-barrel-per-day refinery and more than 1.25 million barrels of storage.Financially, it managed costs effectively, reducing goods sold from $96.2 million in first-quarter 2023 to $79.2 million in first-quarter 2024, and secured a $5-million credit facility for liquidity.However, risks include heavy reliance on refining margins, which saw first-quarter 2024 revenues drop to $91 million from $116.7 million the previous year, and high customer concentration, with 89% of 2023 revenues from two main customers. Moreover, persistent debt issues, significant default amounts, and concerns over affiliate transactions further cloud its financial stability.(You can read the full research report on Blue Dolphin Energy here >>>)\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "Symbiosis Coalition seeks to identify and scale next-generation nature restoration projects with a focus on certainty of climate impact\nThe Symbiosis Coalition aims to facilitate an advance market commitment (AMC) of up to 20 million tons of nature-based carbon removal credits. While only a fraction of the world's total carbon removal goals, this is the first and largest AMC ever for nature-based carbon removal, equivalent in volume to the 2030 carbon removal goals of the state of California. The goal of the Coalition is to send a strong demand signal to accelerate the development of high-impact, science-based restoration projects that will advance progress on global climate goals.\nSymbiosis will focus on catalyzing and scaling carbon projects that meet the highest quality bar for planet and people, integrating the most recent science and data on the climate impact of restoration while equitably involving and compensating Indigenous Peoples and local communities.\nThe Coalition will translate its goals into action by establishing and communicating clear quality criteria for nature-based carbon removal procurement efforts, engaging independent experts to continuously review these criteria in line with latest science and update them as needed, with the goal of creating a joint Request For Proposal (RFP) process to support Symbiosis offtake commitments, and paying the real cost necessary to enable these projects to happen.\nSymbiosis will transparently share lessons learned through these efforts with the broader public, rigorously monitor and evaluate impact from projects, and continually evolve its efforts as new data, science, and lessons arise to advance public confidence in nature\u2019s role in fighting climate change.\nNEW YORK, May 22, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Salesforce announce the Symbiosis Coalition, an advance market commitment for nature-based removal credits in the voluntary carbon market. These companies have collectively committed to contract up to 20 million tons in nature-based carbon removal credits by 2030 that have high certainty of impact on the climate and result in equitable outcomes for the communities whose livelihoods depend on these projects.\nNature restoration is essential to meeting the world\u2019s climate goals, but nature-based projects are complex and challenging to get right. Projects that integrate new technology and research to better measure outcomes, equitably engage Indigenous Peoples and local communities, and balance carbon sequestration benefits with other environmental co-benefits can come with significant cost. As a result, the nature-based carbon removal market has been hampered by a perceived lack of high-quality restoration projects and uncertainty around willingness to pay, keeping investors on the sidelines and eroding public trust in nature-based removal credits\u2019 potential for climate and social impact. The Coalition will help members address these challenges by facilitating the signing of long-term offtake agreements for projects that incorporate conservative assumptions on climate impact, draw on the best available science and practice, and equitably involve and compensate Indigenous Peoples and local communities.\nThrough a strong demand signal and a willingness to pay the real cost that it takes to develop these high-quality projects, Symbiosis intends to partner with like-minded investors, NGOs, market standard setters, and project developers to clarify the bar for what \"good\" restoration looks like and enable more of these projects to happen.\nWhile the aforementioned companies acknowledge the imperative to first reduce their own emissions, they also recognize the necessary role of a high-integrity carbon market and of nature protection and restoration in addressing climate change. A recent McKinsey analysis highlighted that carbon dioxide removal will likely require $6 trillion to $16 trillion of cumulative investment by 2050 to achieve net-zero goals. With under $15 billion invested in carbon removals to-date and under-investment in ecosystem protection and restoration, bold action is needed. Symbiosis will complement other critical, climate-focused AMCs that encourage investment in forest protection at the jurisdictional level and aim to scale the market for engineered carbon removals.\nGrowing something new\nSymbiosis intends to serve as an independent, non-profit joint procurement vehicle for nature-based carbon removal credits guided by five quality pillars: conservative accounting, durability, social and community benefits, ecological integrity, and transparency. These pillars will inform more specific quality criteria for the procurement of various nature-based project types, with an initial focus on forest and mangrove restoration.\nMembers will have the opportunity to purchase carbon removal credits that count towards their pledge through a joint RFP in addition to their own efforts. The initial RFP will focus on afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation projects (ARR), inclusive of agroforestry. Symbiosis will apply a set of criteria for ARR projects informed by a suite of independent technical advisors (acknowledged here) and that build on the most conservative standard for measuring real nature-based climate impact on the market today. These criteria emphasize:\nDynamic baselining to address additionality,\nRobust approaches to leakage, and\nPathways to creating durable, long lasting projects.\nIn addition, Symbiosis will prioritize projects that demonstrate financial transparency, greater biodiversity benefit, and equitable engagement and outcomes for Indigenous Peoples and local communities.\nNature-based projects are complex and challenging to get right. With that in mind, the Coalition will transparently share lessons learned throughout the procurement process. Members will work collaboratively to rigorously evaluate project impact and align on potential remedies if projects underperform, whether directly engaging with a project developer to make changes, working with a registry to ensure that pooled buffer reserve carbon removal credits are canceled appropriately, or other novel solutions. Symbiosis will work with external experts to ensure that its quality criteria continually reflect the best available data and science on climate impact and to advance consistent and unified standards across the market.\nSymbiosis hopes to inspire other buyers to follow its standards and ultimately expand its membership to other companies. Symbiosis looks forward to collaborating with the broader restoration and carbon market ecosystem \u2013 investors, NGOs, standards bodies, project developers, researchers, and other stakeholders \u2013 to lay the foundation for a vibrant carbon market with nature at the forefront.\nKate Brandt, Chief Sustainability Officer at Google: \"Google is thrilled to join other Symbiosis founders and members to help grow the nature-based carbon removal market in a way that is firmly guided by science and has a measurable impact on the atmosphere. While we\u2019re first and foremost committed to reducing emissions from our operations and value chain, we recognize that won\u2019t be enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. It\u2019s critical that we harness the power of both technology and nature to enable carbon removal at gigaton-scale and with the highest certainty of impact.\"\nBlair Swedeen, Global Head of Net Zero and Sustainability at Meta: \"We are excited to join other leading companies to signal our support for the highest quality carbon removal projects that have an impact for people and the planet. Reducing our emissions and helping to scale a robust carbon market that includes nature-based and technological carbon removal solutions are essential parts of achieving our sustainability goals, and we\u2019re proud to partner with our peers to help tackle the climate crisis.\"\nMelanie Nakagawa, Chief Sustainability Officer at Microsoft: \"High-quality, nature-based solutions are vital to addressing climate change, and our work with the Symbiosis Coalition is a key step towards realizing our carbon negative goal by 2030 through a diversified portfolio of carbon removal. This collaboration will help build the overall market for these solutions, leading to more restoration purchases that benefit all of us. Continued investment in carbon removal is important not just to meet our goals but for the world to meet its goals.\"\nSuzanne DiBianca, EVP and Chief Impact Officer at Salesforce: \"Through effective collaboration, we can rapidly scale high quality nature-based credits and improve market integrity, driving significant benefits for both people and the planet. We're proud to be a founding member of Symbiosis, and are committed to our Nature Positive Strategy, emphasizing nature-based solutions including blue carbon projects, 1t.org, and empowering ecopreneurs. These initiatives highlight the critical role of diverse ecosystems in accelerating climate action to protect nature and biodiversity.\"\nJulia Strong, Executive Director of Symbiosis: \"Symbiosis represents a steadfast commitment to the importance of nature to climate action and the role of carbon markets, when done right, to financing critical climate solutions. These leading companies are committed to making restoration the most effective lever it can be in tackling climate change. Symbiosis sends a strong signal to project developers that buyers are willing to pay what it takes for high-quality projects that benefit the environment and local communities.\"\nTo learn more, visit the Symbiosis website at www.symbiosiscoalition.org.

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Meta Platforms' Facebook removed the account of the suspected shooter of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico after the attack, the company and a state agency said on Tuesday, as the government continues to probe whether the attacker had help.\nFico is recovering in hospital and no longer in immediate danger after being hit by four bullets last Wednesday, in the first major assassination attempt on a European political leader for more than 20 years.\nSlovak government officials said on Sunday, four days after the shooting, that the attacker may have not been a \"lone wolf\" as first believed, with one factor being that the suspect's Facebook and communication history was deleted after the attack.\nInterior Minister Matus Sutaj Estok had said an investigation team had been set up, which would also look into whether the suspect acted as part of a group of people who had been encouraging each other to carry out an assassination.\nOn Tuesday, Meta said it had removed the attacker's account on the night of the incident and had informed Slovak authorities about the removal. It remained in touch with authorities and law enforcement, it said.\nNews websites Dennik N and Aktuality were the first to report Meta had removed the attacker's Facebook profile.\nThe state Council for Media Services, which had been in contact with Facebook and other social media platforms immediately after the attack, also said in a statement that Meta had informed it on Tuesday of the account removal.\nSutaj Estok told broadcaster TA3 on Tuesday evening the most likely version was still the attacker had accomplices but investigators were working on both possibilities, including him acting alone.\n\"I guarantee we will investigate everything,\" he said.\nSutaj Estok had said on Sunday when discussing the possible involvement of more people that \"I think that two hours after... committing this act, the perpetrator had all Facebook and communication history erased, and it was not erased by him or apparently by his wife.\"\nOfficials have said the attack on Fico was politically motivated. Local news media say the suspect - identified by prosecutors as Juraj C. - is a 71-year-old former security guard at a shopping mall and the author of three collections of poetry.\nThere has been no official statement made public from the suspect, or any lawyer representing him.\n(Reporting by Jason Hovet; Editing by Mark Potter)\n"

        "Author": "  Joseph Ax ",
        "Text": "By Joseph Ax\n(Reuters) - Families of the victims of the 2022 elementary school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, filed two lawsuits on Friday against Instagram's parent company Meta, Activision Blizzard and its parent Microsoft and the gunmaker Daniel Defense, claiming they cooperated to market dangerous weapons to impressionable teens such as the Uvalde shooter.\nTogether, the wrongful death complaints argue that Daniel Defense \u2013 a Georgia-based gun manufacturer \u2013 used Instagram and Activision's video game Call of Duty to market its assault-style rifles to teenage boys, while Meta and Microsoft facilitated the strategy with lax oversight and no regard for the consequences.\nMeta, Microsoft and Daniel Defense did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nA spokesperson for the Entertainment Software Association, a lobbying group representing the video game industry, said many other countries have similar levels of video game playing but less gun violence than the United States.\n\"We are saddened and outraged by senseless acts of violence,\" the group said in a statement. \"At the same time, we discourage baseless accusations linking these tragedies to video gameplay, which detract from efforts to focus on the root issues in question and safeguard against future tragedies.\"\nIn one of the deadliest school shootings in history, 19 children and two teachers were killed on May 24, 2022, when an 18-year-old gunman armed with a Daniel Defense rifle entered Robb Elementary School and barricaded himself inside adjoining classrooms with dozens of students.\nThe complaints were filed on the two-year anniversary of the massacre by Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder, the same law firm that reached a $73 million settlement with rifle manufacturer Remington in 2022 on behalf of families of children killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.\nThe first lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, accuses Meta's Instagram of giving gun manufacturers \"an unsupervised channel to speak directly to minors, in their homes, at school, even in the middle of the night,\" with only token oversight.\nThe complaint also alleges that Activision's popular warfare game Call of Duty \"creates a vividly realistic and addicting theater of violence in which teenage boys learn to kill with frightening skill and ease,\" using real-life weapons as models for the game's firearms.\nThe Uvalde shooter played Call of Duty \u2013 which features, among other weapons, an assault-style rifle manufactured by Daniel Defense, according to the lawsuit \u2013 and visited Instagram obsessively, where Daniel Defense often advertised.\nAs a result, the complaint alleges, he became fixated on acquiring the same weapon and using it to commit the killings, even though he had never fired a gun in real life before.\nThe second lawsuit, filed in Uvalde County District Court, accuses Daniel Defense of deliberately aiming its ads at adolescent boys in an effort to secure lifelong customers.\n\"There is a direct line between the conduct of these companies and the Uvalde shooting,\" Josh Koskoff, one of the families' lawyers, said in a statement. \"This three-headed monster knowingly exposed him to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it.\"\nDaniel Defense is already facing other lawsuits filed by families of some victims. In a 2022 statement, CEO Marty Daniel called such litigation \"frivolous\" and \"politically motivated.\"\nEarlier this week, families of the victims announced a separate lawsuit against nearly 100 state police officers who participated in what the U.S. Justice Department has concluded was a botched emergency response. The families also reached a $2 million settlement with the city of Uvalde.\nSeveral other suits against various public agencies remain pending.\n(Reporting by Joseph Ax and Katie Paul in New York and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco, Editing by Deepa Babington)\n"

        "Title": "The Art of Valuation: Discovering Meta Platforms Inc's Intrinsic Value",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with META.\nAs of 2024-05-13, Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $548.47. It's currently trading at a price of $476.2. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 13.18%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$17.55\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.49%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 35.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n622.62\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n930.79\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n548.47\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $588.03. This valuation indicates that the Meta Platforms Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 19.02%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Author": "  Jeff John Roberts ",
        "Text": "Bad people who prey on those looking for love, or hoping to make a quick buck, have been around since biblical times. But in recent years, the rise of three newer technologies\u2014social media, online dating platforms, and crypto\u2014has supplied these predators with powerful new tools to expand their reach. The result has been a recent flood of heartbreaking stories about online romance scams and \"pig butchering,\" a term used by Chinese crooks to describe slowly gaining the trust of someone before fleecing them in an investment swindle.\nThe good news is that some of the biggest companies whose platforms are exploited for these scams are fighting back. On Tuesday, an unusual coalition of tech and crypto companies joined with Match\u2014the online-dating giant that runs apps like Tinder\u2014to announce Tech Against Scams, an initiative to share information and resources in order to combat romance scams and pig butchering. The coalition includes Meta, the parent company of Facebook and WhatsApp, as well as the crypto firms Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple, and Gemini.\n\u201cWe hope that this coalition will serve as a force multiplier for security teams at tech companies to share threat insights and trends to enable more impactful disruptions of scam networks around the world,\" Meta Chief Information Security Officer Guy Rosen said in a statement.\nThe new coalition comes at a time when pig butchering has become a growing problem in the U.S. Last week, the Justice Department arrested two Chinese nationals in California who allegedly managed an international pig-butchering syndicate that had taken in at least $73 million. An earlier FBI report, meanwhile, stated that Americans lost $700 million to romance scams in 2022 and $2.5 billion overall to crypto-related scams.\nIn an interview with Fortune, Match VP of Trust and Safety Yoel Roth explained that the current wave of scams is primarily being run by criminal gangs in Southeast Asia. These gangs often rely on victims of human trafficking to reach out to potential marks in other countries, and entice them into text-message exchanges. These conversations involve the scammer posing as a love interest or a friendly source of investment advice with the goal of persuading the recipient to send cryptocurrency to the criminal gang. After extracting as much money as they can, the sender vanishes.\nAccording to Roth, who occupied a similar trust-and-safety role at Twitter, the scammer gangs have become adept at migrating to other online platforms\u2014be it a social media site or a dating app\u2014if they are detected and kicked off a site. He says that by forming a coalition, the companies will no longer be operating in silos. Instead, they will be able to swap information that expedites the discovery of scammers, and to share the tools they have each built to fight them. Roth's hope is that by combining resources, the group will be able to quickly boot the criminals no matter \"where in the kill chain\" they are discovered.\nPhilip Martin, chief security officer at Coinbase, says Tech Against Scams was inspired in part by similar initiatives launched in an earlier era when Facebook and Google worked together to detect bad actors on their sites. He added that even though the new coalition includes Coinbase's rivals in the crypto industry, \"there are no competitive concerns\" when it comes to sharing information that could identify and thwart scammers.\nTech Against Scams is the first coalition of its kind to span a diverse group of tech and crypto companies, and it intends to get bigger. Martin and Roth said the group is already talking to several other firms, including some very familiar to consumers, that are used by crooks for romance and pig-butchering scams.\nCurrently, there are notable names missing from the coalition\u2014the giant crypto exchange Binance and the stablecoin issuer Tether, whose tokens are a big part of the illicit pig-butchering economy. Martin would not say if he or other members of Tech Against Scams have been in talks with the two companies, but did say the coalition is open to any that shares its goals.\nBoth Martin and Roth sought to present a realistic view of their attempts to combat romance scams and pig butchering, as each noted that the improvements they make will be incremental and not solve the problem entirely. \"The reality is these scams have been around since the beginning of time,\" said Martin.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 May 10, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Meta Platforms META, Super Micro Computer SMCI, Robinhood Markets HOOD, Arm Holdings ARM and Coinbase Global COIN.\nUnlike last quarter, this earnings season is proving more treacherous for investors. Slight misses or even a lack of better-than-expected forward guidance is being punished in stocks like Meta Platforms. Meanwhile, bears pounced on AI juggernaut Super Micro Computer for simply not pre-announcing earnings like it did last quarter.\nOverall, Wall Street is providing clues that a lot of the recent good news has been priced into stocks. Furthermore, even the strongest bull markets experience ebbs and flows and do not trend higher in a straight line. Nonetheless, earnings and underlying fundamentals drive stocks in the long term, and bull markets tend to last much longer than most anticipate.\nBelow are the three of the strongest earnings reports of this earnings season thus far:\nZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock Robinhood is one of the most popular brokerages in the United States. Robinhood was the first major broker to \u201cdemocratize\u201d trading by offering a commission-free investing app. The app rose to prominence during the meme stock craze that was spurred on by retail investing groups on the social media platforms.\nLast night, HOOD reported first-quarter earnings that trounced Zacks Consensus Estimates by 260%. Over the past four quarters, positive earnings beats have become the norm, with an average EPS beat of 230%!\nNet deposits are one of the most important metrics to monitor for brokers. HOOD net deposits reached a record $11.2 billion in Q1, translating to a 44% annualized growth rate and contributing to a 30% growth rate over the last twelve months.\nRobinhood recently announced a new \u201cGold\u201d credit card. HOOD has already gained a healthy 260,000 new subscribers.\nZacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock ARM Holdings is a dominant player in the semiconductor industry due to the company\u2019s energy-efficient designs, which are critical to the function of smartphones, laptops, and AI servers. Though ARM shares have come down to Earth after an explosive debut, the company\u2019s fundamentals are very much intact.\nRevenue is expected to remain solid and steady, growing 23.19% in 2025 and expected to grow more than 20% in 2026.\nOne statement from the ARM CEO in the conference call stood out to me: \u201cFrom cloud to edge, all AI software models, from GPT to Llama, rely and run on the Arm compute platform. As these models become larger and smarter, their requirements for more compute with greater power and efficiency can only be realized through Arm.\u201d My interpretation of this statement is that Arm is one of the best AI \u201cpure plays\u201d on Wall Street.\nCoinbase is the leading crypto exchange in the United States. Recently, COIN smashed earnings estimates by reporting EPS of $1.64 billion versus estimates of $1.32 billion. However, what\u2019s most impressive about COIN is that despite volatility in the crypto industry, the company\u2019s cash hoard has grown steadily since going public back in 2021.\nThough earnings reactions were relatively muted this quarter, these three companies are firing on all cylinders.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Author": "  Thomas Barrabi ",
        "Text": "Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg faces a potential revolt at the company\u2019s annual meeting on Wednesday as shareholders push the Big Tech firm to step up transparency regarding its efforts to protect kids online.\nA group led by Lisette Cooper, vice chair of the Franklin Templeton subsidiary Fiduciary Trust International and the parent of a child sex abuse survivor, is backing a non-binding resolution urging Meta\u2019s board to publish an annual report tracking the company\u2019s performance on child safety and protecting young users from harm on its apps.\nThe report would require \u201cquantitative metrics appropriate to assessing whether Meta has improved its performance globally regarding child safety impacts and actual harm reduction to children on its platforms.\u201d\n\u201cIf they want to reassure advertisers, parents, legislators, shareholders on whether they\u2019re making a different on dealing with this problem on harm to children, they need to have transparency,\u201d Cooper said in an interview with The Post. \u201cThey need better metrics.\u201d\nThe resolution is set for a vote during a time of intense scrutiny for Zuckerberg-led Meta \u2013 which faces a legal and regulatory crackdown in the US and abroad about its alleged failure to keep kids safe on Instagram and Facebook.\nZuckerberg himself recently apologized to the families of victims of online sex abuse during a high-profile Congressional hearing.\nMeta\u2019s board of directors opposes the resolution, arguing in an April proxy statement that the \u201crequested report is unnecessary and would not provide additional benefit to our shareholders.\u201d\nCooper and her allies cite a raft of pending litation against Meta related to child safety. Last October, Meta was sued by dozens of states who alleged that the company had \u201cignored the sweeping damage these platforms have caused to the mental and physical health,\u201d including poor sleep, disruption to schoolwork, anxiety and depression.\nA separate suit from New Mexico\u2019s attorney general alleged Meta has exposed underage users to purported sex predators.\nAs The Post reported earlier this month, Meta is also spearheading a massive lobbying campaign to kill or weaken a pair of New York bills aimed at protecting kids online.\n\u201cChildren are going to be the users of the future. If they have a bad experience on the platform, they are not going to keep coming back. This makes a huge difference to us as investors,\u201d Cooper added.\nTwo of the largest proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co. have recommended shareholders vote in favor of the resolution.\n\u201cWe believe that the requested report and the adoption and reporting of targets will provide shareholders with valuable information, so they can better understand this sensitive issue in the context of the Company\u2019s efforts to minimize harmful content on its platforms,\u201d Glass Lewis said regarding the proposal.\nISS determined that \u201cshareholders would benefit from additional information on how the company is managing the risks related to child safety.\u201d\nShareholder resolutions are essentially doomed without the support of Zuckerberg, who controls 61% of the company\u2019s voting power through his ownership of so-called super voting Class B shares.\nProxy Impact, which filed the resolution on Cooper\u2019s behalf, noted in a filing that a similar proposal at last year\u2019s annual meeting received nearly 54% support from shares that weren\u2019t controlled by Meta management.\n\u201cThis is like a basic first step for any business plan \u2013 get the data,\u201d said Proxy Impact CEO Michael Passoff. \u201cWhat gets measured gets managed, and they\u2019re not doing that. Or if they are, they just aren\u2019t making it available to anyone.\u201d\nIn its proxy filing, Meta noted various steps it has taken to address online child safety concerns, including the creation of \u201cmore than 30 tools across our apps to help support teens and families\u201d and existing policies that prohibit harmful content that seeks to exploit kids.\n\u201cWe want people, especially young people, to foster their online relationships in a safe, positive, and supportive environment, and we work closely with a broad range of stakeholders to inform our approach to safety,\u201d the company said.\nMeta\u2019s board also recommended that shareholders reject a number of other resolutions, including one requesting a third-party report that would assess the \u201cpotential risks and benefits of instituting a higher minimum age for users of its social media products.\u201d\nMeta\u2019s legal and regulatory headaches on the issue of child safety aren\u2019t limited to the US.\nEarlier this month, the European Commission revealed it was investigating whether Meta had violated a sweeping new law called the Digital Service Act, which requires the largest tech firms to police content on their platforms.\nEuropean watchdogs expressed concern that Facebook and Instagram \u201cmay stimulate behavioral addictions in children\u201d as well as \u201crabbit-hole effects,\u201d where kids stay glued to the apps despite harmful health effects.\nMeta could face fines of up to 6% of its annual revenue if it is found to have violated the DSA.\n"

        "Title": "AMZN vs. META: Which Magnificent Seven Stock Is Better?",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "In this piece, I evaluated two of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), using TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool below to see which is better. A closer look suggests a bullish view for Amazon and a neutral view for Meta.\nOf course, neither company needs an introduction, but Amazon is an e-commerce and cloud-computing giant, while Meta Platforms owns and operates several social networks, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and others.\nShares of Amazon are up 15% year-to-date and have soared 69% over the last year, while Meta Platforms stock is up 22% year-to-date and 80% over the last 12 months.\nAlthough their year-to-date performances are somewhat similar, that\u2019s where the similarities between these two companies end. While both are part of the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks, they operate in totally different businesses despite both having a technology bent.\nHowever, a closer look at their latest earnings results and the market\u2019s reactions to those reports reveals something very interesting. In short, investors initially rewarded one for spending more on artificial intelligence technology and punished the other for the same thing.\nIt seems clear that both Amazon and Meta Platforms could benefit from improved AI technology, but unfortunately, this sort of manic-depressive behavior is commonplace on Wall Street right now. Let\u2019s see if those totally opposite reactions were warranted.\nAt a P/E of 50.9x, Amazon is trading at a discount to its five-year mean price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 72.2x. Its forward P/E of about 36.4x is also quite attractive and suggests analysts are projecting significant increases in earnings over the next 12 months. Thus, a bullish view seems appropriate, especially considering the cloud computing results in Amazon\u2019s latest earnings report.\nFor the first quarter, Amazon reported adjusted earnings of 98 cents per share on $143.3 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of 84 cents per share on $142.5 billion in revenue. Sales in North America rose 12% year-over-year to $86.3 billion, while international sales grew 10% year-over-year to $31.9 billion. Revenues in the cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), surged 17% year-over-year to reach $25 billion.\nAmazon\u2019s management guided for second-quarter revenue of $144 billion to $149 billion, which came up short of the consensus estimate of $150.1 billion, and operating income to be between $10 billion and $14 billion. Analysts are also projecting adjusted earnings of $1.02 per share for the second quarter.\nAlthough Amazon stock initially dropped after the April 30 earnings release, it recovered quickly, soaring from about $179 before the release to around $185 now. This action is particularly interesting in light of the company\u2019s disappointing guidance, as the Street has typically been punishing companies that come up short of expectations in their outlooks.\nHowever, the initial post-earnings drop could have been due to the press release with the disappointing guidance, with the rebound coming after the earnings call. On that call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attributed the recently achieved $100 billion annual revenue run rate for AWS to their AI-related enhancements.\nEvercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney also told clients in a note on Tuesday that it was the first quarter since Q3 2022 in which AWS\u2019s total-dollar revenue growth surpassed that of Microsoft\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. In fact, AWS is becoming more profitable as well, with its operating income jumping 84% to $9.4 billion and its operating margin expanding to 37.6% from 24% in the year-ago quarter.\nAll of this adds up to a bright future for Amazon, which suggests that it\u2019s meaningfully undervalued at current multiples.\nAmazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 42 Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $213.74, the average Amazon stock price target implies upside potential of 18.65%.\nAt its current P/E of about 25.1x, Meta Platforms is trading roughly in line with its five-year mean P/E of about 26.5x. Its forward P/E of 21.6x suggests analysts are looking for a relatively small earnings increase over the next 12 months, but it\u2019s not a significant drop between the current and forward P/E, suggesting a bit more stability rather than soaring earnings to come. Thus, a neutral view seems appropriate, especially considering a key piece of the latest earnings report.\nMeta Platforms posted its latest earnings results on April 24, reporting adjusted earnings of $4.71 per share on $36.45 billion in revenue versus the consensus numbers of $4.32 per share on $36.15 billion in revenue. However, investors were displeased with the company\u2019s revised outlook, which boosted its expected capital expenditures.\nMeta now expects to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion on capital expenditures (capex) this year, up from the previous guidance of $30 billion to $37 billion. The company said those increased capex will enable it to speed up its infrastructure investments in support of its AI roadmap.\nMeta stock plunged $50 following that release, as investors actually penalized the company for its increased AI spending. However, a key difference from Amazon is that Amazon is already showing results from its AI investments, while Meta is merely planning for future AI enhancements. Of course, Meta has already rolled out some AI enhancements, like its AI chatbot, but it clearly is planning much more with that sizable increase in capex.\nAdditionally, Meta\u2019s Reality Labs division continues to report sizable losses, so investors may be concerned about the company\u2019s ability to transform new technologies into profits. In the first quarter, Reality Labs posted a loss of $3.85 billion, bringing its losses to more than $45 billion since the end of 2020.\nMeta Platforms has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $530.93, the average Meta Platforms stock price target implies upside potential of 20.2%.\nWhile it\u2019s hard to go wrong with Amazon or Meta Platforms, Amazon is the clear winner of this pairing due to its valuation, successful implementation of AI to boost demand, and results from its cloud computing division, AWS.\nOn the other hand, Meta\u2019s AI ambitions are incomplete as it significantly boosts spending on AI. As a result, those AI efforts look like a bit of a show-me story, at least until the capital is spent and we see the results of those ambitions. It\u2019s understandable that investors would be concerned about Meta\u2019s ability to turn its new technologies into earnings based on the Reality Labs losses that are piling up.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "When Wall Street is too focused on the short term it can create great buying opportunities for patient investors. You can scoop up shares in a stock during periods of elevated pessimism and set yourself up for market-beating returns -- if you're willing to hold through some volatility.\nThat could be the situation facing investors with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) today. The social media giant's share price fell after management said in a recent earnings update that sales growth might slow in the coming quarters even as spending soars on artificial intelligence (AI) investments.\nAlong with the concerning guidance, there was plenty of good news about the business in the quarterly report that the market seemed to ignore. Let's look at five positive takeaways from the late April earnings update that suggest Meta Platforms is a buy right now.\nMeta's collection of social media apps isn't struggling to grow. The daily active user base rose 7% to hit 3.24 billion, up from 3.19 billion in late 2023. \"We're seeing strong momentum within our family of apps,\" management said in a press release.\nThat success is critical because it's the foundation of revenue growth in Meta's core advertising business. Sales were up a blazing 27% year over year in Q1, landing at $36.5 billion.\nMeta is doing a better job balancing its advertising sales. Most of its growth comes from higher ad impressions and Meta delivered 20% growth year over year in ad impressions in Q1. That isn't sustainable at this pace. Yet rising prices are amplifying this growth, with prices up 6% compared to the prior quarter's 2% uptick. Ideally, higher prices will allow Meta to lean less heavily on increased ad impressions as the year progresses.\nWall Street wasn't thrilled to hear that management projected higher spending through 2024 and 2025 as Meta invests in building up an AI lead. Still, the company heads into this ramp-up period with excellent financial momentum. Expense growth was just 6% in Q1, trailing revenue growth by 21 percentage points. That gap pushed the operating margin to 38% of sales from 25% of sales a year ago. Operating earnings nearly doubled to $14 billion.\nExecutives aren't abandoning the cost-cutting approach that has helped push profitability so much higher in the past year. \"We're very focused on ... discipline throughout the company, even as we are investing to support AI and Reality Labs initiatives,\" CFO Susan Li said in late April.\nShareholders are increasingly seeing more direct cash returns from this business. There's the company's recently initiated dividend, of course. But Meta is also aggressively buying back stock. Dividend payments totaled $1.3 billion last quarter while share repurchases were $15 billion. That's a bit higher than free cash flow in the period, which was just over $12.5 billion.\nThere's no denying that Meta Platforms plans to spend much more cash over the next few years on projects that don't have a clear payoff in sight. The Reality Labs division lost $4 billion in Q1 on just $380 million of revenue, for example, and executives say this trend shouldn't improve dramatically in the short term. Meta spooked some investors when explaining its expectations for spending on AI in 2025 and beyond. \"We have tremendous ambitions in the AI space,\" Li said in a conference call.\nThat prospect for higher spending shouldn't turn investors off to this stock, though, which is down 10% from recent highs. The next year shouldn't be as impressive when it comes to profitability gains, sure. But Meta Platforms can invest in its growth ambitions while still generating strong overall returns.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have been among the big winners over the last year and a half, but the social media stock's rally hit a wall in April after it fell on its first-quarter earnings report.\nAccording to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Meta stock lost 12% in April. As you can see from the chart below, the stock was actually in positive territory for most of the month before falling sharply at the end of April after its earnings report came out.\nShares of Meta actually bucked the broader trend in the stock market in the first half of the month as investors seemed to fear that tech stocks had become overvalued amid signs that the Fed might delay interest rate cuts.\nHowever, that optimism went by the wayside after the company reported first-quarter earnings on April 24. The stock fell 10.5% the following day, though it had traded down as much as 16%.\nMeta actually topped estimates on a strong quarter, reporting revenue growth of 27% to $36.5 billion, which was ahead of the analyst consensus at $36.2 billion.\nThe company experienced a 20% increase in ad impressions across its family of apps and the average price per ad rose 6%, a sign of increasing demand among advertisers and a strengthening ad market.\nOn the bottom line, Meta's results also impressed as the margins expanded after it reduced headcount last year with several rounds of layoffs. Earnings per share jumped 114% to $4.71, which was ahead of estimates at $4.32.\nWhile investors were pleased with that performance, comments about the rest of the year prompted the sell-off.\nThe company said it would increase its capital expenditures for the year from $30 billion-$37 billion to $35 billion-$40 billion to support its artificial intelligence (AI) investments, and it raised its expense forecast for the year from $94 billion-$99 billion to $96 billion-$99 billion.\nFinally, its second-quarter revenue guide was $36.5 billion-$39 billion, which translated to 24% growth, but the midpoint was below the consensus at $38.29 billion.\nThe sell-off in the stock in response to the increased spend on investments seems like a mistake, but the company's growth rate could slow as the benefit of its job cuts starts to roll off.\nHowever, with the reset in the stock price, the valuation still seems appealing. The social media stock still looks like a good candidate for long-term outperformance.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms Stock (NASDAQ:META): Will Its Colossal Gains Continue or Reverse?",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Social media giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0has grown remarkably, soaring approximately 490% in under two years. However, Meta recently saw its most significant market cap decline since 2022, shedding around $200 billion following its Q1 results. The stock received downward revisions in target prices across Wall Street. The crucial question now is whether to buy or sell. Personally, I view this as an opportunity to invest in the stock based on its AI-based growth trajectory. I believe it can keep rising.\nMeta\u2019s Q1 adjusted earnings of $4.71 per share handily beat the consensus estimate of $4.32 per share. Also, earnings more than doubled year-over-year compared to earnings of $2.20 per share in the prior-year period. Revenues jumped 27% year-over-year to $36.5 billion, meeting consensus estimates by $36.2 billion.\nThe revenue jump was fueled by a 27% rise in Advertising revenue (accounts for 98% of total revenues) to $35.64 billion. However, the Reality Labs division (the division that invests in the Metaverse) continued to report losses, amounting to $3.85 billion for the quarter.\nDespite the EPS beat, the stock experienced its largest single-day decline (15%) in over two years. This decline can be attributed to lower-than-expected revenue guidance and higher-than-expected capital expenditures (CAPEX) forecasts.\nThe Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp parent expects Q2 total revenue to range between $36.5-39 billion, while the consensus was pegged at $38.3 million. CAPEX is expected to increase to $35-40 billion versus the prior guided range of $30-37 billion. Further, expenses are expected to increase and are forecasted to continue to increase through next year. For FY2024, total expenses are predicted to range around $96-99 billion versus the prior guided range of $94-99 billion.\nDuring the earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg elaborated on Meta\u2019s heightened investment plans in AI infrastructure. The company aims to inject billions into the AI space and develop its proprietary AI chips, thereby reducing dependence on chipmakers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nIn terms of newer products, the company also announced that MetaAI, featuring Llama 3 (competing with Microsoft\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini), is poised to become the most efficient AI assistant. This innovation could represent a substantial business opportunity in the coming years, further contributing to revenue growth.\nMeta\u2019s AI investment plans align somewhat with its major competitors, who are also making substantial investments in the AI domain. While Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported CAPEX of $12 billion in the recently ended first quarter, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) spent $14 billion. Both Google and MSFT plan to escalate their CAPEX spending in AI in the upcoming quarters.\nHowever, Google and Meta\u2019s shares soared after their recent earnings. On the contrary, Meta\u2019s shares plunged as their capital investments are still not visible in their revenue and earnings growth. For instance, Google and Microsoft\u2019s capital investments in AI are yielding impressive growth in their cloud businesses. However, Meta\u2019s Reality Labs business segment still remains unprofitable, with reported losses exceeding $45 billion since the end of FY2020.\nIn essence, while AI spending is translating into direct gains for Google and Microsoft, it\u2019s taking Meta longer to show such returns, turning it into a capital-intensive, cash-sucking endeavor. Therefore, the following question arises: should investors wait and observe or buy the stock at current levels following the recent decline?\nIn the long run, Meta\u2019s move to produce its own chips will likely benefit the company significantly by reducing costs associated with expensive GPUs procured from NVDA currently. Additionally, owning its AI infrastructure promises faster and more efficient processing of vast amounts of data for the social media giant.\nIn terms of its valuation, Meta is attractively valued. Currently, it\u2019s trading at an attractive P/E ratio of 23.5x compared to much higher multiples of its peer group. For the sake of comparison, Microsoft is trading at a P/E of 35x, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is trading at over 50x.\nDespite elevated capital expenditures, Meta\u2019s free cash flows remain healthy at $49.5 billion for the past 12 months, or 4.1% of the current market capitalization. It is worth noting that the company started a dividend for the first time in the preceding quarter and continued to buy back shares, implying that management is confident in the company\u2019s fundamentals.\nThe Wall Street community is clearly optimistic about the stock. Overall, META commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell. Meta Platforms stock\u2019s average price target of $530.93 implies 11.73% upside potential from current levels.\nSocial media giant Meta has built a vast user base over time, establishing itself as the clear industry leader. Its steady position among the world\u2019s \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d mega-cap stocks is well-deserved, supported by the continued growth in advertising revenue per user. Notably, Meta\u2019s revenues and margins have been growing impressively, and the integration of AI infrastructure across its portfolio is poised to drive revenues even higher in the coming years.\nFor those who missed out on Meta\u2019s remarkable stock rally (second only to NVDA) over the last two years, the current dip presents a buying opportunity, in my view. I personally plan to buy the stock and hold it for the long term.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) - Meta Platforms' Facebook removed the account of the suspected shooter of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico after the attack, the company and a state agency said on Tuesday, as the government continues to probe whether the attacker had help.\nFico is recovering in hospital and no longer in immediate danger after being hit by four bullets last Wednesday, in the first major assassination attempt on a European political leader for more than 20 years.\nSlovak government officials said on Sunday, four days after the shooting, that the attacker may have not been a \"lone wolf\" as first believed, with one factor being that the suspect's Facebook and communication history was deleted after the attack.\nInterior Minister Matus Sutaj Estok had said an investigation team had been set up, which would also look into whether the suspect acted as part of a group of people who had been encouraging each other to carry out an assassination.\nOn Tuesday, Meta said it had removed the attacker's account on the night of the incident and had informed Slovak authorities about the removal. It remained in touch with authorities and law enforcement, it said.\nNews websites Dennik N and Aktuality were the first to report Meta had removed the attacker's Facebook profile.\nThe state Council for Media Services, which had been in contact with Facebook and other social media platforms immediately after the attack, also said in a statement that Meta had informed it on Tuesday of the account removal.\nSutaj Estok told broadcaster TA3 on Tuesday evening the most likely version was still the attacker had accomplices but investigators were working on both possibilities, including him acting alone.\n\"I guarantee we will investigate everything,\" he said.\nSutaj Estok had said on Sunday when discussing the possible involvement of more people that \"I think that two hours after... committing this act, the perpetrator had all Facebook and communication history erased, and it was not erased by him or apparently by his wife.\"\nOfficials have said the attack on Fico was politically motivated. Local news media say the suspect - identified by prosecutors as Juraj C. - is a 71-year-old former security guard at a shopping mall and the author of three collections of poetry.\nThere has been no official statement made public from the suspect, or any lawyer representing him.\n(Reporting by Jason Hovet; Editing by Mark Potter)\n"

        "Author": "  Jeff John Roberts ",
        "Text": "Bad people who prey on those looking for love, or hoping to make a quick buck, have been around since biblical times. But in recent years, the rise of three newer technologies\u2014social media, online dating platforms, and crypto\u2014has supplied these predators with powerful new tools to expand their reach. The result has been a recent flood of heartbreaking stories about online romance scams and \"pig butchering,\" a term used by Chinese crooks to describe slowly gaining the trust of someone before fleecing them in an investment swindle.\nThe good news is that some of the biggest companies whose platforms are exploited for these scams are fighting back. On Tuesday, an unusual coalition of tech and crypto companies joined with Match\u2014the online-dating giant that runs apps like Tinder\u2014to announce Tech Against Scams, an initiative to share information and resources in order to combat romance scams and pig butchering. The coalition includes Meta, the parent company of Facebook and WhatsApp, as well as the crypto firms Coinbase, Kraken, Ripple, and Gemini.\n\u201cWe hope that this coalition will serve as a force multiplier for security teams at tech companies to share threat insights and trends to enable more impactful disruptions of scam networks around the world,\" Meta Chief Information Security Officer Guy Rosen said in a statement.\nThe new coalition comes at a time when pig butchering has become a growing problem in the U.S. Last week, the Justice Department arrested two Chinese nationals in California who allegedly managed an international pig-butchering syndicate that had taken in at least $73 million. An earlier FBI report, meanwhile, stated that Americans lost $700 million to romance scams in 2022 and $2.5 billion overall to crypto-related scams.\nIn an interview with Fortune, Match VP of Trust and Safety Yoel Roth explained that the current wave of scams is primarily being run by criminal gangs in Southeast Asia. These gangs often rely on victims of human trafficking to reach out to potential marks in other countries, and entice them into text-message exchanges. These conversations involve the scammer posing as a love interest or a friendly source of investment advice with the goal of persuading the recipient to send cryptocurrency to the criminal gang. After extracting as much money as they can, the sender vanishes.\nAccording to Roth, who occupied a similar trust-and-safety role at Twitter, the scammer gangs have become adept at migrating to other online platforms\u2014be it a social media site or a dating app\u2014if they are detected and kicked off a site. He says that by forming a coalition, the companies will no longer be operating in silos. Instead, they will be able to swap information that expedites the discovery of scammers, and to share the tools they have each built to fight them. Roth's hope is that by combining resources, the group will be able to quickly boot the criminals no matter \"where in the kill chain\" they are discovered.\nPhilip Martin, chief security officer at Coinbase, says Tech Against Scams was inspired in part by similar initiatives launched in an earlier era when Facebook and Google worked together to detect bad actors on their sites. He added that even though the new coalition includes Coinbase's rivals in the crypto industry, \"there are no competitive concerns\" when it comes to sharing information that could identify and thwart scammers.\nTech Against Scams is the first coalition of its kind to span a diverse group of tech and crypto companies, and it intends to get bigger. Martin and Roth said the group is already talking to several other firms, including some very familiar to consumers, that are used by crooks for romance and pig-butchering scams.\nCurrently, there are notable names missing from the coalition\u2014the giant crypto exchange Binance and the stablecoin issuer Tether, whose tokens are a big part of the illicit pig-butchering economy. Martin would not say if he or other members of Tech Against Scams have been in talks with the two companies, but did say the coalition is open to any that shares its goals.\nBoth Martin and Roth sought to present a realistic view of their attempts to combat romance scams and pig butchering, as each noted that the improvements they make will be incremental and not solve the problem entirely. \"The reality is these scams have been around since the beginning of time,\" said Martin.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"
