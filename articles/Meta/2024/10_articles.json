        "Title": "Meta\u2019s \u2018permanent\u2019 efficiency layoffs affected about 100 employees, including engineering and business roles",
        "Author": "  Kali Hays ",
        "Text": "Scores of Meta employees have been laid off this week, as the company embraces a new corporate culture of \u201cefficiency\u201d around resources and headcount.\nAround 100 people were impacted by the latest round of reorganizations and a related reallocation of some resources inside Meta, three people with knowledge of the company told Fortune. Such changes and related incremental cuts to teams have been frequent at Meta this year, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg sticks to his vow that 2023\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d would become a \u201cpermanent\u201d part of how his company operates going forward. A handful of workers at Instagram and Messenger were cut earlier this year amid other team reorganizations and the elimination of certain job titles.\nThis week's cuts mark at least the third time this year that incremental layoffs occurred at Meta. This time, it mostly impacted people working in Instagram, Facebook, and Reality Labs, according to the people familiar. Many of those affected were software engineers whose specific roles were eliminated, but some jobs in monetization were also cut. The Verge first reported that layoffs occurred at Meta, although none of the specifics have been reported.\nMost of the people impacted received several weeks of advance notice that their roles were being either eliminated or moved to a new team or location, and were allowed to apply internally for other jobs made available to them. Some were successful. Some were not. Others accepted four months of severance in advance instead of going through that process, according to the people familiar.\nThe layoffs are separate from a disciplinary action Meta carried out last week that saw about 20 people in its Los Angeles office let go for improper use of GrubHub credits. The credits were given specifically for workers to buy meals while working at the office, but some were found to have used the credits for personal items or home delivery over the course of several months, as first reported by the FT.\nMeta, which had 70,799 full-time employees at the end of its most recently reported quarter, cut tens of thousands of employees over the course of 2022 and 2023 in the wake of the pandemic. While the company has not had such mass layoffs in 2024, team-specific reorganizations this year have felt \u201cconstant,\u201d one person told Fortune, noting that Reality Labs seems to go through a re-org \u201cevery few months.\u201d\nAnother person said that while such changes have long been a part of Meta\u2019s operation, a new push toward work on AI projects means more and more resources are being directed to AI and infrastructure teams. The company is also going through a process of \u201cremapping\u201d roles, deciding where the bulk of specific teams will be physically located given a three-day in-office work mandate that has caused some jobs to be moved or eliminated, the person said.\n\u201cA few teams at Meta are making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy,\u201d a Meta spokesperson told Fortune. \u201cThis includes moving some teams to different locations, and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like this when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees.\u201d\nHowever, not all of the people laid off were given such notice, two sources told Fortune. Several people were \u201csurprised\u201d by emails that hit their inboxes this week explaining that their last day of work would be this Friday because their role had been eliminated. \u201cEveryone was not treated the same in this,\u201d one of the people said.\nSeveral laid-off employees were in their jobs for one year or less, according to two of the sources. Jane Manchu Wong, who gained online notoriety for reverse-engineering incoming features for social media platforms before they were announced, joined Meta last year to work on its newest platform, Threads. However, she moved this year to a team within Instagram that was impacted by this round of layoffs. Wong posted that she was impacted by the cuts on Threads. However, no one working on the Threads team was laid off.\nDespite the incremental nature of this recent round of layoffs, workers within Meta are expecting more such cuts, either later this year or early next year. Although the company is hiring more, headcount is being kept \u201cvery tight,\u201d the person said, and performance reviews are tougher than ever.\nAre you a Meta employee or someone with insight or a tip to share?

        "Author": "  Fatima Gulzar ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Internet Content Stocks to Buy. In this article, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks among the best internet content stocks.\nAccording to\u00a0Grand View Research, The global digital content creation market value stood at\u00a0$25.6 billion in 2022\u00a0and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% from 2023 to 2030. In 2023, North America dominated the digital content market. The primary drivers are the increasing use of social media and the digital change occurring across different industries. According to a study by Kepios,\u00a062.3%\u00a0of individuals in the entire globe use social media. As of April 2024, the average daily usage is 2 hours and 23 minutes per this study. Kepios analysis reveals that the number of people using social media grew meaningfully during the first three months of 2024, and annual growth rates are still significantly more than 5%.\nContent creation is also being transformed by artificial intelligence. According to Custom Market Insights, the global market for AI-powered content creation was valued at\u00a0$2.3\u00a0billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.7% to reach USD 7.9 billion by 2033. Moreover, AI programs like GPT-4 are being used to generate graphics, music, and text. Gartner projects that 30% of all digital content will be artificial intelligence generated by 2025. This facilitates hyperpersonalization, which allows material to be personalized to specific consumers while also streamlining the content creation process.\nSecondly, the popularity of short-form video material is skyrocketing, emerging as a major trend in the content production industry. Platforms like Instagram Reels and TikTok have paved the way for this movement. In 2024, 85% of marketers anticipate short-form videos to be the most successful type of social media content, according to a HubSpot survey. The snackable aspect of this format makes it ideal for grabbing the attention spans of increasingly transient internet consumers.\nThirdly, digital content is projected to become more interactive in the future. Advancements in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are opening up greater opportunities for immersive experiences. The AR and VR market is expected to reach\u00a0$1.5\u00a0trillion by 2030, according to a PwC report.\nIf we take a broader view, according to the PWC\u2019s Global Entertainment & Media\u00a0Outlook\u00a02024-2028, there are a number of significant growth prospects in the industry, which is expected to reach US$3.4 trillion by 2028. Notwithstanding persistent upheavals and the necessity of reinventing company models, the industry presents substantial income opportunities. Growth is anticipated to be driven by advertising, with spending forecast to reach US $1 trillion by 2026 because of connected TV and internet advertisements. Due to market saturation, streaming services are being forced to investigate ad-supported business models and creative content. Revenues from gaming are predicted to surpass $300 billion by 2028, particularly in Asia Pacific. The industry is still thriving. Companies navigating shifting market dynamics will find more opportunities in high-growth regions and market categories.\nWe sifted through holdings of Internet Content ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 Internet Content stocks. Then we selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among institutional investors. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s Facebook had more than 3 billion monthly active users. This demonstrates how firmly Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has established itself in the social media industry. Facebook is a major player in the online content market. According to Sprout Social, Instagram has over\u00a02\u00a0billion monthly active users and is owned by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\nAdvertisers are drawn to the platforms of large American IT companies because of their growing user base and engagement, as well as the valuable data they provide. The company\u2019s top-line growth and cash flow should benefit from these valuable assets, and Morningstar analysts predict that advertisers will continue to spend more money online.\nThrough its Reality Labs branch, META is making significant investments in the metaverse, virtual reality, and augmented reality spaces. Nonetheless, the company has come under fire for paying large sums of money to these new customer channels.\nDespite the company\u2019s intention to reduce Reality Labs\u2019 hardware spending by 20% by 2026, BofA Securities continues to maintain the $550 price objective. Considering the sustained high level of customer interest in AR glasses, a potential budget reduction is seen as a planned response to the diminishing market for VR products.\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported a $13.5 billion profit in Q2 2024, above estimates and driving up the stock price by almost 7%. Revenue for the most recent quarter was $39 billion, a 22% rise YoY and above market estimates. The tech behemoth with headquarters in California is expected to earn between $38.5 billion and $41 billion in revenue in the third quarter.\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world\u2019s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users across its platform. The company generates revenue predominantly from advertising. which accounts for over 95% of its total revenue, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal fourth quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings surpassing analyst estimates. The better-than- expected revenues were attributed to strong advertiser demand and Al-driven ad improvements. Moreover, the company materially raised its fiscal first quarter sales and earnings guidance above analysts\u2019 estimates, buoyed by continued strong advertiser demand trends and enhancements to Reels. Advantage+. Click-to-message, and Shop Ads. Further, management noted that ongoing investment in Al is enhancing user engagement and advertiser returns through improved targeting and measurement. Separately, Meta authorized a new share repurchase plan representing approximately 5% of its market capitalization and announced the initiation of its first dividend, implying an approximate 0.4% yield.\u201d\nSimon Wang\u2019s\u00a0Franchise Capital\u00a0is the only stakeholder in the company from among the funds in Insider Monkey\u2019s database. It owns 33,091 shares worth $18.94 million as of Q2.\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of the best internet content stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "Text": "By Katie Paul\nNEW YORK - Facebook owner Meta said on Friday it was releasing a batch of new AI models from its research division, including a \"Self-Taught Evaluator\" that may offer a path toward less human involvement in the AI development process.\nThe release follows Meta's introduction of the tool in an August paper, which detailed how it relies upon the same \"chain of thought\" technique used by OpenAI's recently released o1 models to get it to make reliable judgments about models' responses.\nThat technique involves breaking down complex problems into smaller logical steps and appears to improve the accuracy of responses on challenging problems in subjects like science, coding and math.\nMeta's researchers used entirely AI-generated data to train the evaluator model, eliminating human input at that stage as well.\nThe ability to use AI to evaluate AI reliably offers a glimpse at a possible pathway toward building autonomous AI agents that can learn from their own mistakes, two of the Meta researchers behind the project told Reuters.\nMany in the AI field envision such agents as digital assistants intelligent enough to carry out a vast array of tasks without human intervention.\nSelf-improving models could cut out the need for an often expensive and inefficient process used today called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, which requires input from human annotators who must have specialized expertise to label data accurately and verify that answers to complex math and writing queries are correct.\n\"We hope, as AI becomes more and more super-human, that it will get better and better at checking its work, so that it will actually be better than the average human,\" said Jason Weston, one of the researchers.\n\"The idea of being self-taught and able to self-evaluate is basically crucial to the idea of getting to this sort of super-human level of AI,\" he said.\nOther companies including Google and Anthropic have also published research on the concept of RLAIF, or Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback. Unlike Meta, however, those companies tend not to release their models for public use.\nOther AI tools released by Meta on Friday included an update to the company's image-identification Segment Anything model, a tool that speeds up LLM response generation times and datasets that can be used to aid the discovery of new inorganic materials.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Alistair Bell)\n"

However, in this interview, Lee revealed that he had underestimated the market and that it had been extremely resilient and confident, contrary to what he believed earlier. He adds that this indicates the decreasing importance of macroeconomic data to investors.\nLee also adds that for the past two years, investors have been expecting a recession and have held back. Henceforth, with all this cash on the sidelines, investors have been more than willing to invest. October so far has been a great month for the market, despite CPI data being higher than expectations.\nLee emphasizes the need for the Fed to be more supportive as concerns over the job market rise and the upcoming election draws closer. He suggests that despite the election results he expects stocks to perform well in 2025.\nThe market rose to an all-time intraday earlier today and the Fed governor stressed the need for caution amid decreasing interest rates. On October 15, Warren Pies, from 3Fourteen, appeared in an interview on CNBC to discuss his market thesis for the rest of the year.\nPies suggests that rates are the biggest risk to the market at the moment, especially if drastic measures are introduced. He further adds that if the Fed decides to bring the rate down to 3% immediately, the long-term market outlook could be extremely volatile.\nHe explained that the concern is more about the rate of change and not the absolute level the Fed is trying to achieve. Pies adds that the market still has a lot of room to run before another drastic cut is implemented. He emphasized that the Fed must operate at a pace the market can digest. He also suggested that the market has started to reaccelerate, hinting that a soft landing is more likely.\nNow that we have studied the market outlook up until the end of 2024, let's take a look at some of the good stocks to buy right now.\nOur methodology\nWe used a consensus-based approach and sifted through financial media reports to first compile a list of good stocks to buy right now.

Over the past few months, the company has ventured into AI and augmented reality, having launched its debut AR glasses, Orion, in September. On the same day, the company released its most affordable mixed-reality headset, Meta Quest 36.\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is pouring money into AI to become the best recommendation technology company.\u00a0 To align with this goal, the company recently launched new features, helping young adults explore their interests and find new people easily.\nOn September 10, Gil Luria, D.A. Davidson senior software analyst, appeared on CNBC where he named META as a top pick for AI and tech. Luria shares that the mega-cap tech stocks are expected to benefit from the AI boom, and while most of them are getting credit for it, META is not being talked about enough. He adds that META is the only company making significant investments in open platforms, concluding, that the stock is well-positioned to exploit the next two big waves of computing.\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has a sustainable business model and owns crucial technology, making it difficult for competitors to take precedence.

        "Author": "  Eric Revell ",
        "Text": "Tech giant Meta reportedly fired roughly two dozen staffers based in Los Angeles for abusing the company's $25 meal vouchers to purchase non-food household items.\nThe\u00a0Financial Times reported that Meta fired the workers last week after the company discovered that the workers were abusing its food credit system by using the funds to buy other household items, ranging from acne pads and wine glasses to laundry detergent.\nAccording to the report, Meta staff are given daily allowances of $20 for breakfast, $25 for lunch and another $25 for dinner \u2014 similar perks to what other large tech companies offer workers on top of their typical compensation packages.\nMeta employees who were fired had been abusing the system for a long period of time, in some cases pooling their money together or having meals sent home when the company intended for the credits to be used at the office, the FT reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. They added that workers who broke the food voucher rules only occasionally received a reprimand but weren't fired.\nMark Zuckerberg Passes Jeff Bezos As World's Second-richest Person\nThe FT reviewed a post on the anonymous messaging platform Blind, in which a former Meta staffer, who indicated that they had a salary of about $400,000 at the tech giant, said they had used the\u00a0$25 meal credits to purchase groceries like toothpaste and tea at the Rite Aid pharmacy.\nRead On The Fox Business App\nThe staffer said in the post that they admitted to misusing the credits when Meta's human resources department began investigating the practice, and that they were later fired unexpectedly, saying it was \"surreal,\" according to the report.\nFOX Business reached out to Meta for comment.\nMeta Ceo Admits Biden-harris Admin Pressured Company To Censor Americans\nMeta \u2014 the parent company of\u00a0Facebook and Instagram \u2014 has been on a restructuring push the last few years, and the FT reported that the tech giant is also in the midst of a fresh round of layoffs and changes to some of its teams.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced in November 2022 that Meta was laying off more than 11,000 workers, and followed that up with another round of layoffs that affected 10,000 workers in the spring of 2023 during what he dubbed the \"Year of Efficiency.\"\nEarlier this year,\u00a0Zuckerberg said the layoffs weren't due to the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) but rather because Meta, like other tech companies, had invested heavily during the COVID era e-commerce surge and \"overbuilt\" as a result.\n\"I think across the economy, a lot of companies just kind of overbuilt, and then when things went back to pretty close to exactly what they were the way before...

        "Text": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nMeta Platforms (META) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this social media company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 18%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 44% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 28.3%.\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.67, which means that the company gets $0.67 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.58, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\nIn addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Meta Platforms looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 20% this year versus the industry average of 7.9%.\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.3% over the past month.\nMeta Platforms has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Meta Platforms well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on the Magnificent Seven Stocks Plus Netflix.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other magnificent stocks in Jim Cramer's list.\nOn Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the ongoing success of major technology stocks, particularly the Magnificent Seven. He noted that these companies are proving their resilience in the market, no matter the circumstances, likening their performance to having a unique \"Poltergeist 2 magic.\"\nCramer pointed out that this latest rally for the Magnificent Seven differs from previous ones, as it is not merely a zero-sum game where gains for one group come at the expense of another. Instead, other sectors are also thriving, likely due to the influx of capital into the market.\n\u201cUnlike previous Mag 7 rallies, this one\u2019s definitely not a zero-sum equation where the rest of the market does nothing. Other groups can roar, too, in this market, perhaps because there\u2019s just a lot of money going around.\u201d\nHe noted that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean that cash is losing value, creating an environment ripe for growth. He mentioned that the staying power of the Magnificent Seven is truly unbelievable.\n\u201cWe know these stocks will once again be hit by endless worries, giving you more opportunities to buy and more weakness before they snap right back and start climbing all over again.\u201d\nCramer highlighted that this week marks the beginning of a crucial four-week earnings season, emphasizing that these quarterly reports hold significant weight for investors and the broader stock market. He acknowledged the current climate of anxiety, especially following the market's impressive rally. He added:\n\u201cWhy stress about how quickly the Fed will cut rates, Oh? God, I'm sick of that. What matters is they're giving vast swaths of the economy a big boost and I doubt they'll stop anytime soon.\u201d\nCramer also observed that investors often gravitate toward underdogs in the market, suggesting that banks could be the next promising sector. In addition to banks, Cramer also mentioned the potential in pharmaceutical stocks, suggesting that investors might want to consider major players in that sector as well.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of stocks that were discussed by Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 14. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nIn the latest episode, Mad Money\u2019s host mentioned many factors that are contributing to Meta Platforms, Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) success presently. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\u201cMeta's off to the races again. Why not? Thanks to the success of reels, the targeted ads on Instagram, WhatsApp, the Meta-loaded Ray-Bans. Oh, it's awfully hard to bet against this one, isn't it? Very easy to make the case for Meta when you exclude the cash on the balance sheet, the stock is absurdly cheap. It's kind of strange how cheap it is.\u201d\nCramer recently highlighted it among the stocks that have seen the most significant gains. He pointed out Mark Zuckerberg's statement that upcoming advertising efforts will prioritize Instagram and Reels.\nOne of the significant segments within Meta (NASDAQ:META) is Reality Labs, which focuses on developing hardware aimed at immersive experiences. A key offering in this area is the Meta Quest, a virtual reality gaming headset that plays an important role in the company's metaverse vision. In addition to virtual reality, the company is venturing into augmented reality with products like Ray-Ban smart glasses and the Orion spectacles, both of which hold promise for broader market adoption. The company has also made substantial investments in its AI initiatives, especially with the development of Llama, an AI language model.\nAs Llama evolves, it offers the potential to seamlessly integrate hardware and social media platforms, boosting user engagement. For instance, Ray-Ban Meta's smart glasses enable users to make phone calls, listen to music, and capture photos with a simple tap on the frame. In May, a multimodal AI function was introduced for customers in the U.S. and Canada, expanding the glasses' capabilities.\nAlthough the initial launch of the smart glasses faced challenges in gaining consumer interest, the latest iteration, released in late 2023, has already surpassed the sales figures of its predecessor models over two years, indicating a positive reception. Furthermore, in September, a report from Reuters highlighted a significant extension of the partnership between EssilorLuxottica and Meta Platforms, solidifying a ten-year collaboration focused on advancing smart eyewear technology.\nMeta\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) expansive reach is reflected in its user base, which has nearly 3.3 billion daily active users across its various platforms, contributing to substantial advertising revenue. In the latest quarterly report, the company achieved $38.3 billion in ad revenue, alongside an overall revenue increase of 22% compared to the previous year.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on Jim Cramer's list of magnificent stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nRead Next: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Talha Qureshi ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 High Growth NASDAQ Stocks That Are Profitable in 2024. In this article, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks among the high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable.\nMalcolm Ethridge, Capital Area Planning Group managing partner, joined CNBC to talk about where the market could go and his sentiment regarding the AI and overall tech sector. While many analysts believe that it will be the small caps that will lead the growth with interest rates easing and the economy slowing down. We recently covered the\u00a08 Most Undervalued Penny Stocks To Buy According To Analysts, where we talked about how Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors likes the small cap in the current market environment. Here\u2019s a piece from the article:\n\u201cTo talk about what the stock market looks like today and in the near future. Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors joined CNBC in a recent interview. He has been one of the strong proponents and supporters of small-cap stocks. Lee says that we are in a volatile environment currently, due to a few reasons, one being the elections in less than 30 days, the second being the Middle Eastern crisis which is scaring investors, and lastly the port strike that has the potential to cripple the economy. However, he still expressed his optimism that the year-end has a lot of tailwinds and investors shouldn\u2019t be afraid to buy the dip. Moreover, Lee also highlighted that these current events are all short-term headwinds in a buying cycle and are expected to die down quickly.\nEthridge thinks otherwise, he believes that mega-cap stocks will continue to lead market growth, although not at the same pace as in recent years but still at a steady pace. He attributes this to the ongoing influence of artificial intelligence (AI) on various sectors, including real estate and manufacturing, which are becoming increasingly vital due to rising demands on infrastructure.\nMoreover, while explaining why the mega caps will lead the growth, Ethridge pointed out that for the big tech stocks, Fed rate cuts were not necessary as they had significant cash on their balance sheets to reinvest into newer AI ventures. We have already seen Magnificent Seven invest heavily in AI despite the high rate of borrowing thereby leading the bull market in difficult times.\nThe rate cuts have now made it easy for other companies that didn\u2019t have enough cash to borrow and invest in technology. However, he also pointed out that the pace of rate cuts might slow down moving forward, thereby making it hard for small caps to keep up the technology investment race. Ethridge suggests that investors may need to adjust their expectations regarding future Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nMoreover, we are also entering earnings season, will the earnings derail the momentum or continue to boost the market? Drew Pettit, Citi Research Director of US Equity Strategy joined CNBC in another interview. He thinks that we are in for a decent quarter, although we are in an expensive market.\nWhile talking about how various sectors will perform, Pettit mentioned that software has the highest bar within tech, meaning its growth expectations are high, yet many software companies are not monetizing effectively. This creates volatility in stock performance. As earnings reports come in, Pettit suggests investors should focus on consumer behavior and credit conditions, particularly in the banking sector, which is expected to perform well this quarter. He also encouraged investors to look beyond the recent quarter earnings into 2025 and 2026, while choosing companies to invest in.\nOur Methodology\nTo curate the list of 10 high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable in 2024 we used the Finviz stock screener, Seeking Alpha, and Yahoo Finance as our sources. Using the stock screener, we got an initial list of major NASDAQ stocks sorted by their market capitalization. Next, we sourced the 5-year net income growth and revenue growth rates for these stocks from Seeking Alpha and the GAAP trailing twelve-month net income from Yahoo Finance. We only selected stocks that had 5-year net income and revenue growth of more than 15%. Lastly, we ranked the stocks by the number of hedge fund holders in Q2 2024 from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n5-Year Net Income Growth: 24.69%\n5-Year Revenue Growth: 19.06%\nTTM Net Income: $51.43 Billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is another high-growth NASDAQ stock that is profitable in 2024. It is the creator and manager of famous social media platforms, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and runs everything related to the social media that we have today.\nThe strategic edge of the company comes from its huge user base, which makes it impossible for any competitor to challenge its growth. While any tech company can create a social media platform, what they can\u2019t do is drive active users like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does. During the fiscal second quarter of 2024, the company reported more than 3.3 billion active daily users on its social media apps including Facebook, WhatsApp, and others.\nAnother quality that the company has developed over time is its high rate of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). We recently saw investor confidence shattering due to a lack of return on AI investment by tech giants. But not with Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the company currently has a ROIC of 31%, which is more than 3 times the average of the S&P 500.\nIf we look at the past 5 years performance we see that the company has grown its bottom line by 25% and top line by 19%. During the second quarter of 2024, it brought in $10.9 billion in free cash flow indicating strong and profitable fundamentals.\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe are pleased to report that\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of the high-growth NASDAQ stocks that are profitable. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a promising AI stock that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure.

The bull run has seen the market continue to rise to new record highs, supporting revenue and earnings growth across the board.\nFast forward, the upward momentum appears to have peaked, with market indices at record highs. While it was highly expected that stocks would explode on the Federal Reserve offering support to a struggling economy with interest rate cuts, that has not been the case.\nREAD ALSO:\u00a0David Einhorn Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks to Buy\u00a0and\u00a07 Best Nanotech Penny Stocks to Buy.\nIt\u2019s become increasingly clear that investors have become more sensitive to growth scares as the global economy faces many issues. Top on the list is the rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East that threaten to disrupt supply chain networks. Energy prices rising owing to the escalation of a full-blown war could trigger higher inflation, something that is unsettling the markets.\nAnalysts at UBS are already warning investors that they should get overweight on defensive names as global growth slows at the back of deteriorating fundamentals. While UBS doesn\u2019t anticipate a severe downturn, the bank is cautious, advising its clients to focus on important sectors like utilities and pharmaceuticals, which always outperform in a downturn.\nWhile investors are increasingly rotating into defensive plays amid concerns about geopolitical tensions and the slowing global economy, Morgan Stanley Investment Management\u2019s Andrew Slimmon recommends against this strategy.\n\u201cNow is the time to just be cautious. Don\u2019t chase the defensives that are working because I think when we get to the fourth quarter, that won\u2019t work,\u201d the portfolio manager told CNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Exchange.\n\u201cWhile our expectation is for October to remain choppy, we don\u2019t view the overall market action to be bearish and encourage investors to maintain perspective on the longer-term trends,\u201d Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, wrote to clients.\nThe sentiments echo the need to focus on high-growth companies. Investors who diversify their portfolio into high-growth companies eventually earn great returns regardless of how much a stock rises or falls in the short term.\nAnalysts project that S&P 500 stocks will grow at a median annual EPS rate of 8.5% over the next five years. On the other hand, the best growth stocks are well poised to outperform this benchmark by a factor of two to three or more.\nFor starters, companies exposed to artificial intelligence spectacles or those leveraging technology continue to deliver record earnings and revenue growth, thus dominating most hedge fund portfolios. Additionally, the most promising growth stocks, according to hedge funds, are those whose core business would be positively impacted by improving consumer purchasing power. As the Fed steers the economy into a soft landing, consumer purchasing is expected to improve, benefiting consumer cyclical stocks. Moreover, the rate cuts will likely benefit growth and tech stocks as well.\nMarket fluctuations are inevitable, but the secret to a growth stock\u2019s success lies in the robustness of its core operations. Regardless of whether a stock is rising or falling in the short term, if you consistently invest in a competitively solid business, you\u2019ll eventually reap substantial rewards.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of the most promising growth stocks according to hedge funds, we sifted through ETFs and online rankings to find 30 popular growth stocks. Then we selected the 10 that were the most widely held by hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them.\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is arguably the most promising growth stock, according to hedge funds, for diversifying an investment portfolio in the social media space. As the top social media company, Meta has cemented its position in the lucrative advertising business. It also leverages artificial intelligence to strengthen its competitive edge and enhance user experience.\nAs of June, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) commanded over 3.3 billion active users across its suite of applications, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads. The massive target market has made Meta the go-to for advertising campaigns, allowing the company to strengthen its advertising empire.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands out in advertising services as it enables advertisers to reach specific audiences by considering their age, interests, and geographical location. This highly effective business strategy propelled Meta\u2019s stock to unprecedented levels.\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, Meta\u2019s advertising division brought in $38.3 billion in revenue, marking a 22% increase from the previous year. This figure represented 98% of Meta\u2019s total income, indicating its significant influence on its strategic direction.\nGrowth has been excellent, propelled by the ongoing trend of digital advertising. Over the last ten years, Meta has achieved a yearly revenue increase of 29.7%. Considering that the worldwide digital ad market is expected to rise to more than $1 trillion by 2030, Meta still has a strong opportunity for further growth.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s economic moat is solid as it boasts a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 31%, threefold the mean ROIC of the S&P 500. This indicator shows Meta\u2019s remarkable skill in producing sufficient profits from its reinvested capital. Without this barrier, the ROIC number would be significantly reduced. Likewise, the stocks command an average buy rating on Wall Street with a $611.20 price target, implying a 4.32% upside potential.\nBy the end of the second quarter, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) appeared in the portfolios of 219 hedge funds, with a combined stake value of $42.5 billion.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall META\u00a0ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of 10 Most Promising Growth Stocks According to Hedge Funds. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%. AI-related firms have dominated earnings narratives since last year, driving substantial market gains. The S&P 500 is currently at record highs, having risen approximately 21% year-to-date, largely fueled by robust performance in the tech and communication sectors.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nHoward Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, noted that analysts are keen to evaluate how major companies monetize their AI initiatives, with those succeeding in this regard being notably rewarded. Meta, for instance, experienced a surge in share prices after projecting strong sales growth, suggesting that its digital ad revenue is effectively funding its AI investments. Conversely, the expenditures of giants like Google on AI technologies have raised questions regarding their integration with existing business models. With the S&P 500 trading at 22.3 times future 12-month earnings estimates, surpassing its long-term average of 15.7, many investors hope that this quarter's earnings will justify higher stock valuations.

The latest update comes from data center company Equinix, which recently announced that it would be forming a joint venture with GIC, a Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, to raise more than $15 billion in capital. Per the data center company, the capital would be used to expand the US footprint of hyperscale data centers.

        "Text": "When you think of Meta (META), you might think of Facebook, Instagram, or, shudder, the metaverse. But the social media company has quickly become an artificial intelligence darling up there with the likes of OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\nMeta\u2019s AI success comes via its Llama family of models, which the company is infusing across its various social platforms \u2014 including its Meta AI assistant for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Businesses are also putting Llama to work. In August, Meta reported organizations ranging from Accenture (ACN) and DoorDash (DASH) to Goldman Sachs (GS) are using Llama to develop their own AI software.\nIt\u2019s not just that Meta is implementing its AI into its own products, though. The company is also offering up its Llama models as open-source software. Open-source software is, generally, software that companies create and then allow developers to download and augment for free. That contrasts with, say, OpenAI, which uses a closed-source software approach for its GPT family of models.\nAll of that has helped to make Meta a formidable force in the AI space and a potential threat to its AI rivals.\n\u201cIf Llama did not exist, OpenAI and [Google\u2019s] Gemini would be in a better position,\u201d Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThere are undoubtedly some developers who, if not for Llama existing, would have been probably forced to go to Gemini or GPT.\u201d\nBut the AI industry is still in its infancy, and there\u2019s no telling which company will be the big winner in the long run.\nMeta\u2019s AI strategy should provide a number of benefits for the company in the near and long term. Out of the gate, the company is able to apply its Llama models to its products, helping to improve its own offerings while simultaneously proving the software\u2019s worth in real-world scenarios.\nAfter all, if Meta is using its models in its own products, why shouldn\u2019t third-party developers? And because the Llama family is open source, developers can take a look under the software\u2019s hood, allowing them to address any flaws or risks over time.\n\u201cMeta has been democratizing AI, open sourcing it, utilizing what they're building in their own platforms,\u201d said Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman. \u201cThey've been doing it really at all the layers.\u201d\nOf course, Llama won\u2019t just help Meta improve its existing software and build goodwill among developers, it could also prove to be a steady revenue stream in the long run.\n\u201cWe want this to be open, but if you're someone like Microsoft or Amazon or Google and you're going to basically be reselling these services, that's something that we think we should get some portion of the revenue for,\u201d Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during Meta\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings call. \u201cSo those are the deals that we intend to be making, and we've started doing that a little bit.\u201d\nWhile Zuckerberg said he doesn\u2019t think those deals will contribute much to Meta\u2019s revenue now, the CEO said he hopes it can in the long term.\nShares of Meta are up 85% over the last 12 months, compared to Microsoft and Google, which are up 25% and 18%, respectively. Analysts say the company\u2019s shares are priced well relative to earnings, but the promise of how AI will boost the social media company\u2019s own products could prove to be a tailwind.\nMeta\u2019s open-source family of models may give it a competitive edge, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to knock OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, or any of the host of other companies fighting for position in the AI wars out of the game.\n\u201cIt's competitive in the sense that it's a great, cheap alternative for developers,\u201d Munster said. \u201cIt's the most advanced, cheapest alternative.\u201d\nAnd just as Meta\u2019s models continue to evolve, so do its competitors'. Rivals OpenAI and Anthropic have funding deals with Microsoft and Amazon (AMZN), respectively, that give them the cash they\u2019ll need to grow over the years.\nGoogle also has the benefit of being able to offer its Gemini platform on hundreds of millions of Android smartphones around the world, while OpenAI is expected to land on iPhones via Siri in the coming months.\nAnd although consumers will be able to use Meta\u2019s AI services via its family of apps, users will find it easier to call on an AI assistant that\u2019s built into their devices rather than having to open up a third-party app.\nStill, with more than 3.27 billion daily active users across its family of apps, Meta has plenty of opportunities of its own.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": "  Syeda Seirut Javed ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Best Performers List: 12 Stocks Cramer is Talking About.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other best performers on Jim Cramer's list.\nOn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer took a moment to celebrate the two-year anniversary of the current bull market. He mentioned that this particular bull market has been quiet and gentle, which he attributes to the unusual circumstances surrounding its rise. \u201cThe whole first year of this bull\u2019s life was an anomaly. That\u2019s because the Fed was furiously tightening and the market went up anyway,\u201d Cramer explained.\nHe emphasized that for the past two years, opportunities have been evident, stating, \u201cEvery night I say there\u2019s always a bull market somewhere, and for the last two years, well, it\u2019s been right in front of you.\u201d\nCramer then went on to discuss the lead performing stocks and ended the segment, saying:\n\u201cThe bottom line, if you're going to buy these stocks, I\u2019d go first with Nvidia, then with Broadcom, and finally Fair Isaac, if only because we need something that's not connected to the data center, even as we know, it will remain a strong story for the ages.\u201d\nCramer also advised investors to shift their focus away from the consumer price index (CPI) report, suggesting that its significance has diminished since the Federal Reserve began cutting rates.\n\u201cWe had to be concerned about this stuff when the Fed was on the warpath, either raising rates or leaving them higher for longer. Now, though, the Fed is your friend, so I wouldn't obsess about the details.\u201d\nHe did emphasize, however, that the monthly labor report remains important in the current climate. He remarked on the tendency for many to become \u201cFed watchers,\u201d suggesting that this reliance on government data can detract from the deeper analysis of individual companies. Cramer referenced Austan D. Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed, who advised against an overemphasis on CPI data, as the Fed is unlikely to base decisions on it. Cramer explained:\n\u201cWhen the Fed's raising rates in order to stamp out inflation, it can be very important. When we're in a rate hike cycle, you're trying to figure out when that's going to end. But we're not in that kind of cycle anymore. We're in a rate cutting cycle.\u201d\nCramer explained that last month the Fed implemented a double rate cut, setting a downward trend that is expected to continue. He added:\n\u201cSure, if we had a huge spike in the CPI this morning, then maybe the Fed would change its stance. But that would have to be an extreme reading. And there's nothing extreme about today's 2.4% inflation number, just a tick above the expected 2.3, still down from the 2.5% reading from the prior month.\u201d\nCramer concluded with a strong reminder about the nature of investing. \u201cForget the macro, people. It\u2019s not that meaningful when the Fed\u2019s cutting rates. And keep your eyes on the prize: Earnings,\u201d he urged. Ultimately, he reinforced that earnings dictate stock prices in the long run, and that\u2019s where the focus should be for those looking to make money in the market.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks with the biggest gains over the past 2 years that were mentioned by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 10. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of more than 900 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nCramer mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in his list of stocks with the biggest gains. He emphasized Mark Zuckerberg's assertion that future ad campaigns will focus on Instagram and Reels and said:\n\u201cHonestly, how can you have a bull birthday party without inviting Meta, without inviting Mark Zuckerberg? I would never think of it. His last conference call told you a tale that made it sound like all ad campaigns will soon start on Instagram and reels. Am I going to doubt this fella? No. He has the AI to design the most effective targeted ads and you don't need to hire an advertising agency. Much better return on investment.\u201d\nIt is a leading technology company that focuses on creating products designed to facilitate connections and sharing among users through a variety of devices, including mobile phones, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables.\nThe financial performance of Meta (NASDAQ:META) has been remarkable over the years, largely driven by the ongoing shift toward digital advertising. As the global digital advertising market is expected to expand from $366 billion in 2022 to over $1 trillion by 2030, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth.\nWith nearly 3.3 billion daily active users across its platforms, the company generates significant advertising revenue. In its most recent quarterly report, Meta (NASDAQ:META) recorded an impressive $38.3 billion in ad revenue and a 22% increase in overall revenue compared to the previous year. The growth is particularly noteworthy given the scale of the company, which points to a strong demand for its advertising capabilities.\nOverall META ranks 1st\u00a0on Jim Cramer's list of best performing stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Meta Platforms (META): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Meta Platforms (META).\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.35, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 48 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.35 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 48 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 41 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 85.4% and 2.1% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>The ABR suggests buying Meta Platforms, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.3% over the past month to $21.42.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Meta Platforms may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 AI Superstars According to Goldman Sachs.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.\nUS technology stocks have surged dramatically this year, largely driven by the growing excitement surrounding generative artificial intelligence (AI). However, according to research by investment firm Goldman Sachs, this rise is not indicative of a financial bubble like those of the past. The performance of these companies is expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors as well. However, Peter Oppenheimer, the bank's chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research in Europe, has advised investors to diversify their portfolios to manage risk.\nWhile tech stocks have been dominant, contributing 32% of global equity returns and 40% of US equity returns since 2010, these returns are underpinned by strong financial fundamentals rather than speculative bubbles. The earnings per share for the tech sector have increased by 400% since the peak before the 2008 financial crisis, far outpacing other sectors, which collectively saw only a 25% increase. A key driver behind the outsized returns in recent years has been a small group of hyperscale companies, particularly those in software and cloud computing. These companies have leveraged their vast resources and high profitability to dominate the market, with recent performance surging even further due to optimism around AI.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nThis has led to rising valuations, largely concentrated among a narrow group of market leaders. Peter Oppenheimer observes that this pattern mirrors historical trends in technological innovation. From the construction of canals in the 18th century to the adoption of the telephone, new technologies often attract vast capital and competition. Although this does not always result in financial bubbles, there is typically a period where prices decline as competition intensifies, ultimately leading to consolidation in the market. Over time, only a few large companies remain dominant, while growth shifts to secondary innovations that build on the original technology. The AI era is unique in that the dominant companies, which lead in AI, were also at the forefront of the previous tech wave \u2014 particularly in software and cloud services.\nTheir scale and profitability have positioned them well to absorb the high costs of AI investments. However, Oppenheimer notes that new competitors are emerging. The number of AI patents skyrocketed to over 60,000 in 2022, up from around 8,000 just four years earlier, suggesting that AI is following the typical pattern of large-scale capital growth and competition. Oppenheimer also points out that the companies pioneering a new technology are not always the ones that will create the most value from it in the long run. For instance, during the internet boom, telecom companies received significant investment, yet it was companies like those in social media and ride-sharing that capitalized on the internet infrastructure and achieved the greatest success. Similarly, as AI evolves, new companies could emerge as the next wave of tech superstars, reshaping industries beyond the current giants.\nLet's now take a look at the list of 35 AI superstars that are on the major bank's radar. We compiled this list after consulting a report by the bank on the AI industry. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds and hedge fund sentiment is an important indicator that we pay a lot of attention to at Insider Monkey.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. Argus analyst Joseph Bonner recently raised the price target on the stock to $660 from $600 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. In an investor note, the analyst detailed that Meta was benefiting from a re-acceleration in advertising revenue, significant margin expansion as a result of deep cost cuts, and robust cash flow. Per the analyst, the company had also become competitive in the generative artificial intelligence space. Bonner expects AI to begin to pervade Meta's applications to provide another means of optimizing company performance and efficiency.\nLatest reports indicate that the top court in Europe has ruled against Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) over the approach of the tech giant to data retention in the continental ad business. The ruling will add hurdles for social media names looking to garner European ad dollars. The Court of Justice of the European Union found in favor of activist Max Schrems, who challenged Facebook Ireland on issues including harvesting data from the social platform indefinitely for targeted advertising.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the AI superstars according to Goldman Sachs.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of Stocks On the Rise: 8 Best Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against other best rising stocks to invest In now.\nThe market experts believe that Q3 2024 saw stocks experience increased volatility, witnessing rapid declines and then rebounding. As per the US Bank, a significant Q3 2024 trend is the rotation away from the tech sectors. All the investors continue to ask the same question: Will the rally in mega-cap stocks continue? JP Morgan believes that their outperformance has been noteworthy for quite some time. The investment firm stated that, from a research perspective, the valuations of the biggest stocks appear historically expensive, not just in the US but throughout the developed markets. Therefore, the investment firm\u2019s expected return signals now favour the smaller market cap cohorts.\nThat being said, fundamentals for mega-cap stocks remain outstanding. Such giants have much higher profitability, lower debt, and improved earnings momentum. The bank believes that for investors who are worried about a slowdown, pivoting to mid/small caps remains difficult. On the other hand, investors seeing AI enthusiasm entering the speculative phase will find it easier to liquidate the winners. Therefore, the firm believes that the case for building mid/small cap exposure remains reasonable but not compelling.\nGoldman Sachs increased its year-end target for the S&P 500 and expects more gains for the benchmark in 2025. These gains stem from the stocks, which continue to increase on the back of strong economic growth, lower Federal Reserve interest rates, and expansion of corporate earnings. The US stocks are expected to be aided by numerous tailwinds in the final months of the year, after the Fed\u2019s pivot to rate cuts and the new fiscal stimulus from China. Both these measures improved the risk sentiments. Market experts believe that stocks should see support from the Q3 earnings season and expansion of corporate profits in the final 3 months as the economy continues to surpass expectations.\nLSEG data demonstrates that collective S&P 500 earnings for Q3 2024 should grow 5% as compared to the\u00a0previous year to ~$5.11 billion. This reflects a decline from the earlier projections of a\u00a0$5.19 billion tally. Nonetheless, it still indicates strong momentum for this year and next, with Q4 profits anticipated to increase by ~12.5%.\nRecently, Goldman trimmed its 2024 earnings growth forecast to 8.2% from 8.4%. However, the investment firm expects that earnings momentum will continue to build in the next year. The firm increased its profit growth projection by 5 percentage points to 11%. This upward revision to its 2025 EPS estimate revolves around increased margin expansion. The firm added that the broader macroeconomic backdrop is conducive to slight margin expansion.\nMoreover, the firm increased its year-end S&P 500 target to 6,000 points, exhibiting a rise from the prior forecast of 5,600. The investment firm expects a P/E multiple of ~22x for the S&P 500, which remains in line with the company\u2019s macro model of fair value. This will largely remain unchanged over the upcoming 3 months. For 2025, the bank expects the S&P 500 to increase by another ~300 points, to reach the year-end target of 6,300.\nMarket strategists believe that the momentum in the broader equities is likely to be aided by a\u00a0blowout September 2024 jobs report, the\u00a0start of the US Fed\u2019s rate-cutting cycle, and China\u2019s economic stimulus.\nOur methodology\nTo make a list of 8 Best Stocks to Invest in Now, we used stock screeners to find quality stocks that have gained at least 30% on a YTD basis, as of October 7. We also made sure that these stocks were popular among elite hedge funds.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Most Profitable Blue Chip Stocks to Invest In.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other profitable blue chip stocks.\nThe September inflation report came in hotter than expected and showed that it remains sticky. Headline inflation rose by 2.4%, slightly above the anticipated 2.3%, and down from 2.5% in August. Month-over-month, CPI increased by 0.2%, exceeding the forecast of 0.1%.\nCore inflation, excluding food and energy, also came in higher than expected at 3.3%, compared to the anticipated 3.2%, marking a slight increase from August. On a monthly basis, core CPI rose by 0.3%, which matched August\u2019s figures but was above expectations of 0.2%.\nFollowing the report, the market is expecting a 25 basis points rate cut to no rate cuts in the upcoming Fed meeting. According to the CME FedWatch tool, 79.9% of interest rate traders expect the rate cuts to be at 450-475 bps at the coming Fed meeting while 20.1% expect the rate cut to stay the same. At the beginning of the month, 32.1% expected a 50 bps rate cut, while 67.9% anticipated a 25 bps cut.\nDespite the sticky inflation, IBM's vice chair, Gary Cohn believes that the Fed will cut rates by 100 bps this year. In an interview at CNBC's \u2018Money Movers',\u00a0he suggested that the U.S. is experiencing what a soft landing looks like, with inflation decreasing but not steadily. He indicated that reaching the Fed's 2% target will be challenging, as inflation rates are likely to fluctuate around this level.\nCohn noted that for the first time in nearly two decades, the Fed is balancing both sides of its dual mandate, employment, and price stability, after focusing primarily on one at a time. He believes the Fed is making the right decisions and is currently in a delicate position as it missed meeting opportunities this year.\nCohn expects that the Fed will implement a total of 100 basis points in rate cuts this year, likely consisting of 25 basis point reductions over the next couple of months. When asked about inflation targets, he expressed a preference for slightly exceeding the target inflation rate, suggesting that a rate of around 2.2% would be more acceptable in a growing economy than undershooting the target.\nCohn also highlighted concerns about geopolitical risks and said that global tensions could lead to inflationary pressures by disrupting supply chains and increasing shipping costs.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we use stock screeners to identify nearly 30 stocks above $100 billion market cap and $10 billion TTM net income. Next, we narrowed our list to 8 stocks that had a 5-year net income compound annual growth rate of above 10% and were most widely held by institutional investors. The most profitable blue chip stocks are listed in ascending order of the hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 database of 912 hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nMarket Cap: $1.494 Trillion\n5-Year Net Income CAGR: 24.69%\nTTM Net Income: $51.435 billion\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nThird on our list of most profitable blue chip stocks is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which is one of the American Big Tech that has evolved significantly since its inception. It has expanded its portfolio to include widely used platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp.\nWhile the company is making significant investments in several technology-related platforms and products, most of its revenue is generated through advertisement. Through strategic acquisitions and an expanding suite of products, it remains a key player in shaping the future of technology and communication.\nOn September 25, Meta (NASDAQ:META) introduced Orion, its first true augmented reality (AR) glasses, previously known as Project Nazare. These glasses aim to blend the appearance of traditional eyewear with advanced AR capabilities, marking a significant advancement in wearable technology.\nThe company is currently providing access to Orion for its employees and select external testers to refine the product before launching a consumer version. While it is still in the prototype phase and not yet available for consumers, it shows the commitment to creating a polished product. It plans to improve display quality, reduce the size further, and make the glasses more affordable as they move toward a consumer release.\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) is expected to release its earnings on October 30 and some analysts are already showing optimism in its results. On October 9, The Fly reported that Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan raised the price target for the stock from $660 to $670 while maintaining an Overweight rating on the stock.\nThe firm expects its Q3 results and Q4 outlook to surpass consensus estimates and noted strong ad performance in recent months and positive trends for future growth for the company. Cantor believes Meta (NASDAQ:META) will benefit from rising contributions from sectors like travel. Mathivanan mentioned that investor expectations are high due to recent strong performance, and they expect revenue guidance of $48 billion for Q4 to drive further share growth.\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe are pleased to report that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note.

Commenting about the Fed\u2019s rate cut, Fisher recently advised investors not to focus on what the central bank is doing and instead pay attention to long-term investing.\n\u201cThe fact is, and I\u2019ve said this for a long time, I won\u2019t live forever, but I hope to live a long time and keep saying it: central bankers are crazy. Throughout my life, central banks have operated on flawed ideas and groupthink, which is an inefficient way to manage markets.\u201d\nFisher gave an example of how you could end up losing money following the herd mentality when it comes to central bank moves.\n\u201cIf you had followed the common belief that when the Fed and other central banks hike rates, you should get out of stocks, that would have worked for a couple of months in 2022. By the middle of the summer of 2022, during the height of rate hikes, you would have been on the wrong side of the market. From June 2022 onward, as the Fed hiked rates by 75 basis points nearly every month, the market was just a few months away from rising, leading to the bull market we\u2019re in now, in 2024.\nFor this article, we scanned Ken Fisher\u2019s hedge fund\u2019s Q2 holdings and picked its top AI investments. We have analyzed the AI-related growth catalysts for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nBillionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s Stake: $3,164,448,477\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company\u2019s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it\u2019s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year\u2019s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year\u2019s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot,\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall,\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 10th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Billionaire Ken Fisher\u2019s 10 Favorite AI Stocks for the Rest of 2024.

        "Author": "  Nate Raymond ",
        "Text": "By Nate Raymond\nBOSTON (Reuters) -Meta Platforms must face a lawsuit by Massachusetts alleging the social media company purposely deployed features on its Instagram platform to addict young users and deceived the public about the dangers it posed to the mental health of teenagers, a judge ruled.\nSuffolk County Superior Court Judge Peter Krupp in Boston, in a decision made public on Friday, rejected Meta's request to dismiss claims by Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell that it violated state consumer protection law and created a public nuisance.\nThe Facebook and Instagram operator argued the state's case was barred by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, a federal law that broadly shields internet companies from lawsuits over content posted by users.\nKrupp said the law did not apply to false statements Meta allegedly made about the safety of Instagram, its efforts to protect its young users' well-being or its age-verification systems to ensure people under age 13 stay off the platform.\nHe said allegations concerning the negative impacts of Instagram's design features were likewise not barred because the state was \"principally seeking to hold Meta liable for its own business conduct,\" not content posted by third parties.\nCampbell, a Democrat, in a statement said that as a result of the judge's ruling, \"we can now move forward with our claims to hold Meta accountable and continue to push for meaningful change on Meta's platforms that will protect young users.\"\nA Meta spokesperson said the company disagreed with the ruling and that the \"evidence will demonstrate our commitment to supporting young people.\"\nThe ruling came after a federal judge in California on Tuesday rejected a request by Meta to dismiss lawsuits by more than 30 states accusing it of fueling mental health problems among teens by making its social media platforms addictive.\nMassachusetts was one of a handful of states that pursued separate claims in state court, rather than federal, when it sued in October 2023.\nIt became one of the higher profile lawsuits because of allegations it first aired about how CEO Mark Zuckerberg had been dismissive of concerns that aspects of Instagram could have a harmful effect on its users.\nThe lawsuit alleged that features on Instagram such as push notifications, \"likes\" of user posts and a never-ending scroll were designed to profit off of teens' psychological vulnerabilities and their \"fear of missing out.\"\nThe state alleged that internal data showed the platform was addicting and harming children, yet top executives rejected changes its research showed would improve teens' well-being.\n(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi, Bill Berkrot and Deepa Babington)\n"

        "Title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (META) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +12.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 12.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.15 per share, indicating a change of +17.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.38 points to a change of +43.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.18 indicates a change of +13.1% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $40.1 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +17.4%. The $161.69 billion and $184.42 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +19.9% and +14.1%, respectively.\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $39.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.91%. The EPS surprise was +9.79%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nTwo years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nAmid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices.\nAs semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other best stocks to buy which are part of the Renaissance Technologies portfolio.\nRenaissance Technologies is an American hedge fund that specializes in systematic trading and employs statistical and mathematical tools to drive its investment programs. As of March 2024, the fund managed discretionary assets over\u00a0$89 billion, according to their Form ADV. It was founded in 1982 by Jim Simons, a mathematician who worked as a code breaker for the US National Security Agency during the Cold War.\nSimons is considered among the pioneers of quantitative investing. At the time of his death in May 2024, he had an estimated net worth of $31.4 billion, making him the 51st richest person in the world. His use of mathematical models and algorithms to drive long-term investment returns earned him a legacy that rivaled the likes of Warren Buffet and George Soros.\nHis signature Medallion generated average annual returns of 66% for three decades between 1988 and 2018, earning more than $100 billion in profits during the period. The fund started with charging a 5% fixed fee and also had performance charges of 20%, which were later increased to 44% in 2002. Despite those cuts, Medallion earned annual returns of around 39% on average.\nThe fund was closed to outside investors in 1993 and has since then only been available to past and current employees, and their families. Renaissance Technologies does have other funds that are open to outsiders, such as Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund (RIEF) and Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha (RIDA).\nSimons stepped down from active management of Renaissance Technologies in 2010 and resigned as its executive chairman in 2021. Peter Brown is the current CEO of the capital market company. He graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics from Harvard University and also holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University. Brown\u2019s father, Henry B.R. Brown, invented the Reserve Primary Fund in 1970, which was the first money market fund to be set up.\nBrown is committed to the use of mathematical models to discover and unlock the value of stocks in the market. However, Renaissance hedge funds that are open to outside investors have been shrinking for some while. According to a recent report in the Financial Times, RIEF currently manages around $19.6 billion, significantly down from $35.8 billion in 2020. The collapse of RIDA and Renaissance Institutional Diversified Global Equities (RIDGE) has been even worse. The two funds were merged this year. In 2019, RIDA managed about $15 billion, while RIDGE had a portfolio of $14.3 billion. Today, the combined fund manages only $3.6 billion.\nAs a result, Renaissance\u2019s external assets under management have declined from $65.1 billion in 2019 to $23.2 billion today. Much of the exodus happened following the coronavirus pandemic and was driven by a shock performance by the hedge fund as the stock market rattled. In contrast, the Medallion Fund, which is limited to past and current employees, gained 76% in 2020 despite Covid-19. This is because the fund indulges in high-frequency trading with a lower capacity, a strategy that is strikingly different from those applied for external funds.\nHowever, the performance of external funds is beginning to stabilize after the lows over the last few years. RIEF is up 19.8% this year, while RIDA has also gained 17.4%. Though financial experts believe the improvement is owed more to the fund\u2019s performance, rather than flows.\nWe scanned Renaissance Technologies\u2019 13F portfolio, as of June 30, 2024 and picked the top 10 stocks according to their stake value.\u00a0The figures were sourced from\u00a0Insider Monkey Database.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nStake Value as of Q2 2024: $527,481,878\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the largest technology companies in the world. Headquartered in Menlo Park, California, it owns numerous popular social media platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads. According to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, an estimated 3.2 billion people use at least one of Meta\u2019s apps every day.\nThe company reported a stellar quarter in Q2 2024, with revenue soaring 22% to a total $39.1 billion, fueled by a strong show again by Meta\u2019s Family of Apps which contributed $38.7 billion of the share. Most of this was advertisement revenue, led by online commercial vertical and gaming. Net income for the quarter was reported at $13.5 billion, which resulted in an EPS of $5.16, smashing analysts\u2019 expectations of $4.72 per share.\nThe ability to generate robust advertisement revenue despite the global economic slowdown has been the catalyst behind Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s growth. This has boosted investor confidence and resulted in a YTD share price appreciation of over 64%. Another factor driving the positive wave around the stock has been the heavy capital investment in artificial intelligence projects by the company, which has resulted in the successful launch of new products such as Meta Quest 3 and Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, whose demand has outpaced Meta\u2019s expectations.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the\u00a0best stocks to buy now, with 219 hedge funds having investments in the company, according to Insider Monkey\u2019s database for Q2 2024. This includes Renaissance Technologies which had a stake volume of over $527 million, as of June 30, 2024, accounting for 0.89% of its portfolio. There is also a consensus among Street analysts on the stock\u2019s Strong Buy rating.\nWhile the company looks set for long-term growth, there may be some headwinds on the horizon that could impact the stock\u2019s short-term performance. One of them is the slowdown in revenue anticipated for Q3. Last year, much of the revenue was driven by a surge in Reels impressions and an increasing number of China-based advertisers on its social media platforms. That is unlikely to happen this year. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) also plans on spending a staggering $40 billion on further capital expenditure this year, which could adversely affect its short-term financials, and subsequently, its share price.\nOverall, META ranks 7th among the Renaissance Technologies Portfolio: 10 Best Stocks To Buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. In this piece, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks among the list of Goldman Sachs' Phase 2 AI stocks.\nWhile consumer technology stocks had soared in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, back then, their share price gains were due to. the growing demand for technology products and services due to lock downs. Now, big technology stocks have persisted in their strong performance despite high interest rates since they have been judged by the market as the top innovators and performers in the artificial intelligence industry.\nSince AI is somewhat of a ubiquitous technology, its impact is on several industries. So far, we\u2019ve seen most of the stock market returns related to AI directly tied to just one stock. This stock continued to be the fifth most trending AI stocks as recently as in mid October and its share price returns are nothing short of unbelievable. From its bottom in October 2022 when the split adjusted share price was a mere $11.23, the shares have gained a stunning 1,100%. In other words, if you had invested just $100 back then in the shares and then held onto them for dear life, your investment would be worth $1,200 today.\nThis is the magic of AI, a technology that has caught Wall Street and retail investors alike by storm. However, AI\u2019s impact, and its enablement, aren\u2019t limited to the GPU designer we\u2019ve mentioned above. While GPUs are the \u2018oil\u2019 for this technology, a wide variety of other components from data center infrastructure, networking equipment, connectivity, and energy all will have to play their part if OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s plans of initially building as many as 7 AI data centers across the US, with each data center guzzling an unbelievable 5 Gigawatts of electricity, are to come to fruition.\nThis then makes us ask, what are such stocks that might enable 35 Gigawatts of AI data centers across the US? After all, in order to meet the world\u2019s demand for AI chips, Altman believes that an unfathomable $7 trillion will need to be spent for building 36 chip manufacturing fabs and additional AI data centers. This money has to be spent somewhere, and therein lies the answer to our question. Things get clearer when we look at a detailed research report from investment bank Goldman Sachs. This report segregated the AI sector into four categories.\nThe first category only included Wall Street\u2019s AI darling, the second was made of AI capacity providers like server companies, other semiconductor firms, and utilities, the third included firms that sell AI products and software, and the fourth category firms were those that will benefit from AI adoption. In its report, the investment bank shared that year to date in July, the first category had returned 139%. As of mid October, this category has gained 179% on the stock market, so safe to say returns have accelerated despite some turbulence in between. By July, the second group of firms was also doing well. Its returns ranged between ~-8% to ~50%, with the average stock having delivered 22%.\nZooming into these firms, the utility sector is one which had particularly impressed the bank. It shared that utilities were the best performing sector in the flagship S&P index between March and May courtesy of their 16% returns. Their three month returns ranked in the 98th percentile since 2022 and were the third highest after 2003 and 2020 rallies. This outperformance is unsurprising given the strong investments in data centers that have taken the US by storm this year.\nThese investments have led to estimates suggesting that America\u2019s data center hub, Northern Virginia, will require 11,000 megawatts of electricity by 2035 \u2013 demand which has already spurred $5.2 billion in investments for transmission lines and coal fired power plants. Estimates from Boston Consulting Group believe that by 2030, AI will account for 16% of America\u2019s energy consumption and touch 130 gigawatts. For a detailed look at the link between electricity use and data centers, you should read 15 Best Data Center Stocks To Buy According to Jefferies, Citi and Wall Street Analysts.\nThe bustling optimism surrounding AI is also reflected in revenue estimates. Goldman\u2019s September 2024 research shows that 2025 revenue estimates of semiconductor firms, software enablers, and hardware firms except semiconductors are roughly 2.3x, 2.05x, and 1.8x over 2019 levels, respectively. Similarly, non semiconductor hardware companies have seen their revenue forecasts for Q4 2025 jump to $450 billion for a $380 billion gain over Q1 2024\u2019s $70 billion. Makes us wonder whether it\u2019s this group of companies that might see a stock mirror the 1,100% returns of Wall Street\u2019s AI darling.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs\u2019 best phase 2 AI stocks, we ranked the 20 stocks with the highest year to date returns and some other big tech and data center names that have announced multi billion dollars in capital expenditure by their year to date performance.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

        "Text": "Meta fired around two dozen employees from its Los Angeles office for misusing company meal credits for things like laundry detergent, wine glasses and acne treatment pads, a source familiar with the company confirmed to CNN.\nMany of the social media giant\u2019s corporate offices feature elaborate food services to provide employees with meals as a perk. Meta\u2019s two-year-old office near New York City\u2019s Penn Station, for example, features a cafeteria that feels like an upscale food court, with various stalls all free for staff.\nBut for employees at smaller offices without food services, the company provides meal vouchers \u2014 $20 for breakfast and $25 each for lunch and dinner \u2014 so they can have food delivered to the office while on the job.\nThe meal vouchers are meant for employees to eat while working at the office \u2014 sometimes long hours stretching across several meals of the day, notorious in the tech world.\nAn internal investigation found that some LA-based employees used the meal funds to purchase things other than food instead, or had meals delivered to their homes, the source said.\nMeta\u2019s median total annual compensation for individual employees (other than CEO Mark Zuckerberg) is $379,050, the company said in a regulatory filing earlier this year.\nThe firings, which took place last week, were first reported by the Financial Times.\nNews of the firings comes as Meta acknowledged on Thursday that it was laying off people across the company as part of a series of separate restructurings.\n\u201cToday, a few teams at Meta are making changes to ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals and location strategy,\u201d Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton said in a statement. \u201cThis includes moving some teams to different locations, and moving some employees to different roles. In situations like this when a role is eliminated, we work hard to find other opportunities for impacted employees.\u201d\nMeta declined to share how many employees were laid off.\nThe cuts took place across Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook and Reality Labs, which houses Meta\u2019s virtual reality and metaverse efforts.\nAmong those laid off were Jane Manchun Wong, a prominent security researcher who became well known in the tech world for predicting new social media features \u2014 like a Facebook resume feature and a tool on the platform formerly known as Twitter that let users hide replies to their tweets \u2014 before she was hired by Meta in June 2023 to work on the Instagram and Threads team.\nMeta laid off more than 20,000 employees last year over multiple rounds of cuts, in an effort to reverse a year of revenue declines and stagnating user growth, which Zuckerberg termed its \u201cyear of efficiency.\u201d The company\u2019s shares (META) are up nearly 80% from this time last year\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI data center stocks.\nThe AI data center industry is experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and the massive computational power they require. AI data centers are specialized facilities designed to handle high-intensity AI workloads, including machine learning, natural language processing, and neural network training. These facilities integrate advanced hardware and software to process large-scale data efficiently, creating a crucial infrastructure for the global digital economy. Leading technology companies are making substantial investments in AI data centers. For instance, Meta announced plans to invest $33 billion in data center expansion to support AI research and development. Google is also investing billions of dollars in AI infrastructure, committing $3.3 billion in just one region of the United States\u200b. These investments highlight the significance of AI data centers in the broader tech ecosystem.\nAI workloads demand hardware that can process vast amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This need has led to the development of AI-specific chips, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). These chips are essential components in AI data centers.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nWhile AI data centers are essential for technological progress, they consume enormous amounts of energy. According to the International Energy Agency, data centers worldwide account for about 1% of global electricity demand, a figure that could increase significantly with the rise of AI. Cooling systems, necessary to maintain optimal hardware performance, further contribute to this energy demand. To address this, companies are increasingly focused on building energy-efficient data centers. For example, Google has implemented machine learning algorithms to reduce energy use in its data centers by 30%.\nThe AI data center industry will continue to evolve as the demand for AI-driven applications grows. Experts predict a significant shift toward edge computing, where data centers are decentralized and located closer to the source of data generation. This reduces latency and improves performance for real-time AI applications such as autonomous driving and smart cities. Moreover, the integration of quantum computing into AI data centers could revolutionize the field. Quantum computers are capable of processing complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers, making them ideal for AI and big data applications. Companies like IBM and Google are already exploring quantum technology in their AI research.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss.\nThe AI industry is constantly evolving and investors are keeping a close eye on investments, advancements in AI capabilities, and new partnerships to keep pace with the continued rise of generative AI and integration into key industries. One of the most exciting developments in the field of AI over the past week has been the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, which was awarded to scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their pioneering work in the field of machine learning. Hopfield, a researcher at Princeton University, gained recognition for developing an associative memory system, a neural network model capable of storing and reconstructing images or other data patterns. His work revolutionized how data patterns can be represented and recalled, marking significant progress in the field of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Hinton, a professor at the University of Toronto, pioneered a method for autonomously discovering data properties, enabling machines to perform tasks such as identifying specific elements within images. His contributions have been pivotal in advancing AI capacity for image recognition and pattern identification.\nAnother notable report worthy of mention is a recent Reuters study into the funding that AI startups have attracted so far this year. The study highlights the $6.6 billion funding round for AI startup OpenAI recently that pushed the valuation of the company to more than $157 billion. It also spotlights other AI startups that have received more than $500 million in funding this year. These include xAI, CoreWeave, Scale AI, Figure AI, Groq, Mistral AI, and Cohere. They have raised $6 billion, $1.1 billion, $1 billion, $657 million, $640 million, $600 million, and $500 million in funding so far this year, respectively. The startups are all valued at more than $2.5 billion, with xAI, founded by Tesla chief Elon Musk, worth over $24 billion.

        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NasdaqGS:META) is navigating a dynamic environment marked by both opportunities and challenges. Recent highlights include a strong Q2 revenue of $39.1 billion and significant advancements in AI technology, juxtaposed against rising costs and regulatory hurdles. In the discussion that follows, we will explore Meta's core advantages, operational challenges, growth opportunities, and external threats to provide a comprehensive overview of the company's current business situation.\nUnlock comprehensive insights into our analysis of Meta Platforms stock here.\nMeta Platforms boasts significant user growth, with over 3.2 billion daily active users across its apps, as highlighted by CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The company has also made notable strides in engaging young adults on Facebook, which is crucial for long-term growth. Advances in AI have significantly enhanced the quality of recommendations, driving user engagement. Financially, Meta Platforms reported a strong Q2 revenue of $39.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year, and an operating income of $14.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin. The company\u2019s solid cash position, with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, further underscores its financial health. Additionally, Meta is currently trading below its estimated fair value of $730.92, making it an attractive investment despite its higher-than-industry-average Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 28.2x.\nMeta Platforms faces several challenges. The cost of revenue increased by 23%, primarily due to higher infrastructure and Reality Labs inventory costs, as noted by CFO Susan Li. Reality Labs, in particular, reported an operating loss of $4.5 billion, highlighting the financial strain of its ambitious projects. Additionally, total expenses for Q2 were $24.2 billion, up 7% compared to the previous year. Meta\u2019s Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 28.2x is considered expensive compared to the US Interactive Media and Services industry average of 25.9x. Moreover, the company's earnings forecast of 11.6% per year is slower than the US market's 15.2% growth rate, indicating potential underperformance relative to broader market expectations.\nMeta Platforms has several opportunities for growth and innovation. The development of AI technologies is expected to significantly enhance services for advertisers, as emphasized by Mark Zuckerberg. The expansion of Meta AI and the potential for a new major social app could open new revenue streams. Additionally, the future of business messaging, where every business might have an AI agent for customer interaction, presents a substantial market opportunity. The ongoing partnership with EssilorLuxottica to develop multi-generational smart eyewear products, such as Ray-Ban Meta glasses, is another promising avenue. The glasses have already seen high demand in various markets, indicating a successful product expansion.\nMeta Platforms faces several external threats that could impact its growth. Regulatory challenges are a significant concern, with increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in both the EU and the US, as highlighted by CFO Susan Li. The company is also dealing with intense competition in the AI space, which could limit the success of its proprietary technologies like Llama. Market risks are another concern, with expected year-over-year growth to slow in Q3 due to strong growth from China-based advertisers in the previous year. Additionally, the company is involved in multiple legal issues, including a $1.4 billion settlement with the State of Texas over biometric data misuse and a class action lawsuit alleging harm to minors from its social media platforms.\nTo gain deeper insights into Meta Platforms's historical performance, explore our detailed analysis of past performance.To dive deeper into how Meta Platforms's valuation metrics are shaping its market position, check out our detailed analysis of Meta Platforms's Valuation.\nMeta Platforms demonstrates a compelling mix of strengths and opportunities that position it well for sustained success. The company's impressive user growth and enhanced AI-driven engagement underscore its potential for long-term expansion, while its strong financial performance and substantial cash reserves highlight its solid financial health. Facing challenges such as increased costs and regulatory pressures, Meta's strategic focus on AI advancements and innovative product developments, like smart eyewear, offer promising avenues for future growth. Although Meta's Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 28.2x is higher than the industry average of 25.9x, it remains an attractive investment given it is trading below its estimated fair value of $730.92 and is relatively cheaper compared to peers with an average P/E ratio of 34.3x. This blend of solid fundamentals and strategic initiatives suggests a positive outlook for Meta's future performance.\nHold shares in Meta Platforms?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Meta Platforms (META)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $583.04 in the previous session. Meta Platforms has gained 62.9% since the start of the year compared to the 23% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 22.4% return for the Zacks Internet - Software industry.\nThe stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on July 31, 2024, Meta Platforms reported EPS of $5.16 versus consensus estimate of $4.7.\nFor the current fiscal year, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $21.36 per share on $161.62 billion in revenues. This represents a 43.64% change in EPS on a 19.8% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $24.10 per share on $184.04 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 12.8% and 13.88%, respectively.\nMeta Platforms may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\nMeta Platforms has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 27X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 30.5X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 29.2X versus its peer group's average of 24.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.42. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Meta Platforms currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Meta Platforms fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Meta Platforms shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.\nShares of META have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is Upland Software, Inc. (UPLD). UPLD has a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and a Value Score of A, a Growth Score of F, and a Momentum Score of A.\nEarnings were strong last quarter. Upland Software, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 26.67%, and for the current fiscal year, UPLD is expected to post earnings of $0.73 per share on revenue of $274.83 million.\nShares of Upland Software, Inc. have gained 11.9% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 3.22X and a P/CF of 0.32X.\nThe Internet - Software industry is in the top 29% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for META and UPLD, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October.\u00a0Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) \u00a0ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nVenu Krishna, Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that he is not revising his S&P 500 year-end projection of 5,600 because he believes stock valuations are \u201cfull.\u201d\n\u201cIf you see what\u2019s happening, numbers (earnings)\u00a0 have been cut sharply going into the end. What is still anchoring the market is big tech, even though their earnings themselves are kind of decelerating. Then seasonality comes into play. October is the weakest month, and you don\u2019t want to get ahead of that.\u201d\nAsked whether he does not believe the market really broadened out, Krishna said while there were some signs of market broadening, the \u201canchor\u201d of the rally remains big tech, which according to him, are just six stocks.\nMoving beyond the earnings and valuations debate, another factor still impacting investor sentiment is the Federal Reserve\u2019s next moves.\nTalking about the latest Fed minutes released October 9, \u00a0Wolfe Research\u2019s Stephanie Roth said on CNBC that a \u201csubstantial\u201d majority of Fed officials wanted a 50-basis-point rate cut. However, she said in the next meeting, a 50bps rate cut is \u201coff the table.\u201d\nFor this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news. With each stock we mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on Unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\nGene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner, while discussing Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) latest products and the company\u2019s competition with Apple during a program on CNBC, said:\n\u201cIf you were going to think of this as kind of a match between Apple and Meta from that perspective, there has been more momentum around Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and innovation. And to the higher-level question\u2014what\u2019s more important to an investor, an innovative CEO or an operator? The answer is, it\u2019s clearly an innovator. An innovator is more important. On that question, more specifically, an innovator is much more important.\u201d\nAnswering about what side he\u2019d take as a whole, the analyst said:\n\u201cIf you look at the growth rate of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) over the past five years, they\u2019ve grown their business by, let\u2019s call it, 68%. Apple has grown by 42%. But Apple\u2019s stock is up 195%, and Meta is up 160%. These are both class-act CEOs, no question about that.\u201d\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its Q2 results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it\u2019s doing would bear more results in the future.\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company\u2019s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it\u2019s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year\u2019s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year\u2019s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\nRowan Street Capital stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe are pleased to report that\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks Investors are Talking About in October. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Maleha Afzal ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Widely Held Stocks by Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other widely held stocks.\nThe last trading day of September is upon us and so are many questions about the market. On September 30, Dana D\u2019Auria, Envestnet Solutions co-CIO and group president, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss the financial market.\nD'Auria regards employment data to be a major concern at the moment. Since inflation rates are subsiding, employment data is something investors should be on the lookout for, along with other data points including GDP and consumer confidence. She suggests that to ensure a soft landing, the Fed must initiate larger rate cuts, and that recessionary conditions are out of the picture.\nSeptember is notoriously volatile along with October, and, with elections in another 35 days, the conditions may be slightly different or even more turbulent. According to D'Auria, the 50 basis point cut is a catch-up for July, and expecting a 50 basis point cut in November is borderline questionable.\nOverall, she believes that the market has been overshooting and we may have to settle for two 25 basis point cuts before the end of 2024. She reiterates that the job market is crucial and investors must get out of their comfort zone to invest in non-cash opportunities. Investors concerned about low-risk options may consider equities in the defensive sectors that are innately low volatile.\nWall Street is heading to close September and Q3 on a high note and stocks have experienced their best September in over a decade. On September 30, Kevin Gordon, harles Schwab's Director and Senior Investment Strategist, appeared in an interview on Yahoo Finance to discuss his market thesis.\nGordon believes that stocks in the utilities and defensive sectors have caught up to tech stocks amid the AI boom, compared to their financials at the end of FY 2023. However, he does acknowledge that sectors like industrials, financials, and materials are performing relatively well, calling it a case of market broadening.\nIn terms of market breadth, most sectors are experiencing an upward trajectory. Almost 81% of the S&P 500 members are experiencing an uptrend, despite the quality bias investors may have towards certain stocks. According to Gordon, large-cap quality stocks will continue to perform well despite the volatility and the Fed's decisions. Speaking of smaller-cap stocks, he believes that some stocks may struggle a bit especially when it comes to earnings growth.\nOur Methodology\nTo come up with the 10 most widely held stocks by hedge funds, we sifted through Insider Monkey's database that tracks over 900 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. We ranked the top 10 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), commonly referred to as Meta and formerly known as Facebook, is a technology conglomerate behind the leading social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company currently boasts a user base of 3.27 billion daily active users across all its social media platforms.\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is making strides in artificial intelligence and augmented reality. During the second quarter, the company launched its AI Studio in the United States, a platform for people to create, share, and discover artificial intelligence models. In addition to that, on September 25, the company launched Orion, its first augmented reality glasses, the first most advanced pair of AR glasses ever made.\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has a strong position in the market, making it one of the most widely held stocks by hedge funds. By 2026, the company expects to own the best recommendation technology on its social media platforms. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is achieving this by expanding its collection of open models and tools for generative artificial intelligence.\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) reported $39.1 billion in revenue, in the second quarter of 2024, up by 22% year-over-year.\u00a0 The company also generated $10.9 billion in free cash flow supporting its dividend payouts and stock repurchases. With strong expectations ahead of 2024, the company projects revenue to reach $38.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024.\nMar Vista Investment Partners' Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\"During the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company\u2019s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street\u2019s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels).

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we will look at where Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks among the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio.\nRay Dalio was born in 1949 and graduated from Long Island University in 1971. After a brief stint as a clerk on the New York Stock Exchange, he attended Harvard Business School and earned his MBA in 1973. That same year, he became the Director of Commodities at Dominick & Dominick LLC and later traded futures at Shearson Hayden Stone for a year. Dalio founded\u00a0Bridgewater Associates\u00a0in 1973 in his apartment. In July 2011, he stepped down as CEO but continued to work as a co-CIO alongside Robert Prince and Greg Jensen, taking on the title of \u201cMentor.\u201d\nBridgewater Associates is notable for its focus on transparency and accountability. The firm promotes a culture where team members take responsibility for mistakes and learn from them. It encourages questioning and alignment, ensuring everyone regularly evaluates the validity of their ideas. This approach is crucial to the firm\u2019s management style and investment strategies.\nRay Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, emphasized that since 1945, the United States has been the dominant global empire, but it is now in a state of relative decline. This decline isn\u2019t just an opinion, it\u2019s supported by concrete measures such as the nation\u2019s share of global GDP, military strength, and the quality of its education system. These factors indicate that the U.S. is losing its position.\nIn addition to these, Dalio points out two other key elements that often disrupt world order: natural events like droughts, floods, and pandemics, which have historically caused more damage and upheaval than wars, and human creativity and technological innovation, which bring about substantial changes. Dalio believes all five factors are influencing the U.S. today. However, he stresses that the most critical issue is how people manage these challenges together.\nThe ability to address them intelligently and without creating further conflict is essential. If conflict arises, it could lead to a devastating outcome. But if people can come together and handle the situation effectively, the country can navigate these issues successfully. For Dalio, how society deals with one another is the number one factor in determining the future.\nIn a recent Bloomberg interview, Ray Dalio also highlighted significant issues in China that have emerged over the past four years. He explained that China is in need of a major restructuring, as a large portion of individual spending, around 70%, was invested in real estate. With the decline in real estate, stocks, and salaries, people have become more cautious, reducing their spending and holding onto cash. In a deflationary environment, cash has become a relatively safe asset. This situation is affecting both households and businesses.\nDalio also pointed out that the government sector is facing serious challenges. Local governments, responsible for 83% of public spending, previously relied on land sales to generate revenue. With land sales drying up, these governments have accumulated significant debt, and now they\u2019re struggling to pay it off. The key question is how to inject money into these local economies to keep them functioning. Dalio compared the situation to Japan\u2019s struggles in 1990, noting that China\u2019s challenges are even more severe and will require deep restructuring to resolve.\nIn addition to economic concerns, Dalio raised questions about property ownership and values. He referenced Deng Xiaoping\u2019s famous statement, \u201cIt\u2019s glorious to be rich,\u201d and wondered if that sentiment still holds true in China today. The overall environment in the country is becoming more complex and difficult, as these economic and political issues intensify.\nDalio also emphasized the importance of being cautious when investing in China. He made it clear that every country goes through economic cycles, experiencing both highs and lows. According to Dalio, it\u2019s crucial not to invest too heavily in any one country, including China, to avoid having it dominate your portfolio. Despite the challenges China faces, Dalio continues to invest there, but he stressed that the key consideration is the size and structure of the investment. Overall, his experience investing in China has been positive, though careful management is essential.\nOur Methodology\nWe sifted through Bridgewater Associates\u2019 Q2 2024 13F portfolio and picked the top 10 stocks held by the fund.

Something might be wrong with the economy\u2014something they knew about, but we didn\u2019t.\u201d\nJim Cramer was also surprised by bank stock gains.

        "Text": "Monday, October 7, 2024The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) and Philip Morris International Inc. (PM), as well as two micro-cap stocks Earth Science Tech, Inc. (ETST) and Frequency Electronics, Inc. (FEIM). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Meta Platforms\u2019 shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+68.9% vs. +24.3%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone. It witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads.Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)Shares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the year-to-date period (+7.8% vs. +7.1%). The company\u2019s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Splunk acquisition enhances its recurring revenue base.The buyout significantly expands Cisco\u2019s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco\u2019s security portfolio.However, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco\u2019s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition aggravated by Hewlett Packard\u2019s deal to acquire Juniper.(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>>)Philip Morris\u2019 shares have outperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry over the past three months (+16.2% vs. +14.4%). Robust momentum in smoke-free products, IQOS and ZYN, along with combustible pricing, has been working well for the company. Higher pricing variance and solid cost efforts aided the bottom line amid strong currency headwinds in the second quarter of 2024.The consistent success of IQOS and the noteworthy economics of ZYN have further solidified the company\u2019s position, keeping it well-placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2030. These upsides encouraged management to raise its guidance for 2024, wherein net revenues are likely to increase 7.5-9% on an organic basis.However, Philip Morris expects SG&A expenses to remain high in the third quarter due to its planned key commercial activities. The company continues to encounter tobacco leaf inflation.(You can read the full research report on Philip Morris here >>>)Shares of Earth Science have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+143.9% vs. -1.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $512.53 million posted a remarkable 3,796.1% revenue increase to $8.6 million in first-quarter fiscal 2025, largely due to the acquisitions of RxCompound and Peaks. It reported a net profit of $1.1 million against the prior year\u2019s loss.RxCompound\u2019s licensing in 22 states provides significant expansion potential, and synergies with Peaks\u2019 telemedicine platform enhance growth opportunities. Despite a strong balance sheet, the company faces risks including reliance on key customers, rising expenses, supplier concentration and regulatory hurdles.While its 75% gross margin supports profitability, challenges in cost control and supply-chain disruptions could impact future performance. Competitive pressures and share buybacks may also strain resources, challenging future profitability.(You can read the full research report on Earth Science Tech here >>>)Frequency Electronics\u2019 shares have outperformed the Zacks Instruments - Control industry over the year-to-date period (+19.2% vs. +12.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $115.38 million posted strong fiscal Q1 2025 results, with revenues rising 22% to $15.1 million, driven by U.S. government satellite programs. Operating income rose 15% to $2.37 million, reflecting higher margins and cost efficiency.FEI\u2019s expansion into the fast-growing satellite market, including low-cost synchronization systems for LEO satellites, positions the company to capitalize on rising demand for smaller, faster-deployed satellites. Additionally, FEI\u2019s quantum technology initiatives, such as magnetometers, provide growth potential. Gross margin reached a 24-year high of 44.4%.The company declared a $1.00/share dividend in July 2024, supported by its debt-free balance sheet and strong cash position. Risks include a 10% backlog decline, negative operating cash flow, rising R&D expenses, and heavy reliance on government contracts, which could introduce revenue volatility.(You can read the full research report on Frequency Electronics here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC), Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

(NYSE:PLTR) are among the artificial intelligence stocks that have seen strong gains since early to mid-September. While the former is perched at a record high, the latter, despite its recent strong run, is yet to reclaim its Jan. 2021 peak.\nHere\u2019s a look at the relative performance of these two stocks and what the near-term holds for them:\nMeta Vs. Palantir: Meta has gained over 68% for the year-to-date period, while Palantir is up a steeper 133%. The data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel is the fourth best-performing S&P 500 company this year, while Meta, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, holds the 11th spot on the list.\nDon\u2019t Miss Out:\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.This is a paid advertisement.

The forward price-earnings ratio for Palantir is currently at a hefty 95.2 but Meta is trading at a more modest forward P/E valuation of 24.75. The social media giant\u2019s P/E ratio is fairly in line with 21.3 which is applicable to the communications services sector.\nThe Palantir Rally: Palantir has been on an uptrend since it gap-opened higher on Sept. 9, the first session after the S&P Dow Jones Indices said the company would be added to the S&P 500 Index, effective prior to the start of trading on Sept. 23. Commenting on the feat, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said, \u201cThe profitability profile of this story has significantly been bolstered with this another validation moment for the Palantir story.\u201d\nAlthough there was a \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news\u2019 moment after the inclusion, the stock has been grinding solidly higher since the start of October.\nMeta Connects With Investors: After the early August broader market swoon set in motion by yen carry-trade unwinding, Meta\u2019s stock found its feet shortly after and climbed higher until mid-August. The stock experienced a mild pullback that lasted through mid-September.\nThe two-day Meta Connect conference held on Sept. 25-26 saw the company announcing a slew of products and other offerings.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Meta Platforms (META), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry.\nThis social media company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 9.41%.\nFor the last reported quarter, Meta Platforms came out with earnings of $5.16 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.70 per share, representing a surprise of 9.79%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $4.32 per share and it actually produced earnings of $4.71 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.03%.\nFor Meta Platforms, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +2% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News Investors Should Not Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\nCompanies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure to meet the growing demands of machine learning, data processing, and AI-driven applications. This spending is largely concentrated on building data centers, acquiring specialized hardware, and optimizing cloud infrastructure. According to a report by McKinsey, global AI infrastructure spending could reach up to $500 billion by 2027, highlighting the critical role it plays in the future of AI development. A large part of this investment is focused on AI-specific hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are crucial for training and deploying AI models. NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI chips, has seen demand for its GPUs soar, largely due to their centrality in deep learning tasks. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, has remarked that the AI boom is underpinned by massive infrastructure needs, and the market is just at the beginning of this growth curve.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nData centers are another focal point for AI infrastructure spending. AI workloads are highly demanding, requiring specialized facilities that can support high-density computing environments. Blackstone\u2019s $16 billion acquisition of AirTrunk, a leader in AI-driven data centers, underscores the increasing importance of such infrastructure. The deal will add 800 MW of data center capacity, with projections to grow beyond 1 GW, a testament to the rising demand for infrastructure to support AI-driven applications. Cloud infrastructure is also a major area where companies are pouring resources. Cloud giants are increasing their investments in AI infrastructure. These companies are developing new AI-optimized cloud services to cater to businesses adopting AI. Gartner predicts that by 2026, cloud AI infrastructure spending will surpass $200 billion, as enterprises increasingly shift from on-premise AI deployments to scalable cloud-based solutions.\nThomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, recently remarked that AI is unlocking entirely new revenue streams for enterprises, and cloud infrastructure is the backbone enabling this transformation. Beyond just hardware, organizations are also investing in data management platforms and storage solutions to handle the massive amounts of data AI systems require. In fact, estimates suggest that the global AI data infrastructure market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18%, driven by increased data volumes and the need for real-time data processing capabilities. Companies are significantly ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, focusing on hardware, data centers, and cloud computing. With projections showing continued growth in AI workloads, this spending will only increase in the coming years.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill released an investor note on the company following the keynote address of Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg at the Meta Connect event, reiterating a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $600. Thill underlined that the keynote had left analysts more bullish on the consumer and enterprise AI opportunities for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Thill added that on the consumer front, there were bullish views on the impressive traction for Meta AI, with about 500 million monthly active users, and saw potential for new image, translation and voice capabilities to boost core engagement. On the enterprise side, per the analyst, Llama was becoming a serious contender and the advisory saw momentum building with the new multimodal capabilities.\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Now we have stimulus and what looks like some bazooka policies that are supporting that region, and we have a lot of cash on the sidelines.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is expanding its AI-powered chatbot to 21 new locations, including the UK and Brazil, where the social media giant has significant numbers of users, the company announced Wednesday.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nDubai\u2019s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City\u2019s Infrastructure\nHow Mexico City Averted All-Out Drought\nThe Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan\u2019s Capital Is No Longer Working\nAs Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization\nThe Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City\u2019s Populous Outskirts\nMeta AI, the company\u2019s chatbot, lets users converse and get recommendations on its Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger apps. It\u2019s also available as a voice assistant in the social media giant\u2019s smart glasses and mixed reality headsets. Almost 500 million people use Meta AI each month, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said last month.\nMeta AI will be available beginning Wednesday in the UK, Brazil and additional countries in Latin America and Asia, the company announced in a statement. Along with the expansion, the chatbot will also add support for new languages, including Tagalog on Wednesday and Arabic and Thai in the near future. Eventually, Meta AI will be available in 43 countries and a dozen languages, the company said.\nZuckerberg has focused the company since last year on adding artificial intelligence to its products, a strategy that is credited for some recent user growth and advertising success. The emphasis on AI, which requires spending huge amounts of money in computing power, is a pivot away from the company\u2019s earlier attention on the metaverse, a virtual world for work and play. The shift has appealed to investors, who have driven the shares up 67% this year compared with a 20% jump in the S&P 500.\nMeta earlier this year had also planned to launch its AI chatbot in the EU, before facing regulatory pushback. The company\u2019s large language model, called Llama, is trained in part using public posts on Facebook and Instagram. In June, Meta announced plans to start training Llama on posts from European users, but just days later said it would pause those plans indefinitely after the Irish Data Protection Commission pushed back on its decision. At the time Meta said it still planned to bring the product to Europe, but declined to share a timeline.\nA Meta spokesperson said the company didn\u2019t have anything further to share about its plans to expand the chatbot to the EU.\nMeta\u2019s products have faced regulatory challenges in the EU over the company\u2019s handling of personal data. In July, the EU warned Meta that it risked fines for making Europeans pay to block their data on Instagram and Facebook from being used for ads. Last week, the EU\u2019s Court of Justice ordered Meta to stop using data related to a person\u2019s sexuality for ad targeting.\nAlong with the expansion of Meta AI across its apps, the chatbot will also be available on the Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the UK and Australia.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhy OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man\nHow Airbnb Hosts and Frustrated Neighbors Can Find Common Ground\nChina Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space\nInside the Companies That Set Sports Gambling Odds\nJamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary: The Idea That Never Fades\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Is Meta Platforms Stock A Buy?",
        "Author": "  Dan Victor, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has been a dream stock for investors, returning 90% over the past year and an even more spectacular 548% since its low in 2022, when shares briefly traded under $90.\nCompared to a disappointing slowdown after the worst of the pandemic, the social media giant reclaimed its operating and financial success by focusing on core strengths. An all-in approach toward artificial intelligence (AI) as a new growth driver has given shareholders plenty to cheer about.\nThe headlines are positive, but do they make the stock a buy today? Let's discuss whether the rally in Meta Platforms can keep going.\nMeta Platforms is globally recognized through its family of apps and platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, that help people around the world stay connected. Its vast user base and significant reach (3.3 billion daily active people) have proven highly attractive to advertisers.\nThe trends from Meta this year have been very impressive. In the fiscal second quarter (for the period ended June 30), total revenue climbed by 22% year over year, propelled by a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across the family of apps while the average price per ad was also 10% higher.\nA big part of the momentum is the impact of new AI features on advertisement performance. Improved ad targeting based on AI recommendations led to higher conversions for marketers, which in turn supports higher demand for advertising campaigns. Meta also rolled out AI tools like its MetaAI virtual assistant with text and image generation to keep users engaged.\nThese dynamics, with cost-controlling measures, translated into strong profitability. Q2 earnings per share (EPS) were up 73% from last year to $5.16 while free cash flow reached $11 billion.\nAccording to consensus estimates, Meta should grow revenue by 20% this year and maintain a double-digit pace into 2025 and beyond. Earnings should also climb even higher with margins benefiting from the improved AI scale.\nThere's a lot to like about Meta Platforms proving it can continue to innovate through artificial intelligence. The initiation of a $0.50-per-share quarterly dividend earlier this year solidifies it as a blue-chip stock. That said, it's also worth considering potential weak points in the company's profile that could represent risks down the line.\nOne area of concern is that the company hasn't been able to materially diversify beyond advertising. Meta does have the Oculus virtual reality headset line along with its recently prototyped Orion augmented reality smart glasses, but these products are not expected to be major growth drivers for the overall business any time soon.\nThis is in contrast to other \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks that have multiple different operating segments. For example, Alphabet is also a major internet advertising player through search but it has the YouTube video-sharing platform as well, along with the Chrome and Android operating systems.\nThe question mark is how exposed Meta Platforms would be during an economic downturn in which advertising pulls back. Other tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon\u00a0could prove to be more resilient.\nIn terms of valuation, shares of Meta Platform are trading at 27 times its full-year consensus EPS as a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This level represents a discount compared to Microsoft and Apple, which are above 32, but still a large premium compared to Alphabet, which is closer to 21. It's not clear that Meta is significantly over- or undervalued.\nMeta has everything in place to keep rewarding shareholders over the long run. Still, I believe a hold rating is prudent for now, balancing high expectations following what has already been a breathtaking rally this year. Patient investors may manage to scoop up shares of Meta Platforms at a lower price during the next round of volatility or find more compelling opportunities elsewhere in the market.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nGlobal management consulting firm Bain & Company recently released a report on the artificial intelligence industry, highlighting that AI was driving an unprecedented wave of technological change, with the market for AI products and services projected to reach between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Per the research done by Bain, major cloud services providers were at the forefront of AI research and development, pushing the boundaries of larger models, advanced infrastructure, and energy efficiency. These hyperscalers were focusing on the development of larger, more complex models that demanded significant computational power and resources, leading to the need for data centers with energy capacities up to gigawatts, potentially straining energy grids and supply chains.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30\u00a0Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\u00a0and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nBain underlined that while the big players dominated the high end of the market with expansive models and enormous data centers, innovation was also thriving in smaller models. These smaller, domain-specific models were being deployed at the edge, where they were more cost-effective, energy-efficient, and capable of addressing real-time processing needs, particularly in applications like autonomous driving. The proliferation of models like Llama, Claude, and Gemini illustrated how AI was evolving rapidly beyond just a few proprietary models, with many options now open-source or specialized for particular tasks.\nThe research further detailed that the rapid growth in AI workloads, particularly with data-heavy applications, was also reshaping the technology landscape. The need for increased storage, computing power, and memory was driving innovations in data center design, networking, and storage technologies. Per Bain, chip companies and particularly GPU makers were expanding beyond their core graphics processing units to include integrated solutions that improved the efficiency of AI models, with their products now combining compute, memory, and networking capabilities. The competition was also spurring the development of vertically integrated AI solutions, where tech companies designed everything from hardware to software to optimize AI performance.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To\u00a0and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

(NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The firm has taken a different approach than other tech giants when it comes to AI, choosing to open source the large language model it has developed, unlike Google and Microsoft. This is largely because the firm plans to use the generative AI potential to enhance the advertisement market. Meta just recently overtook Google in digital ad market share and now plans to beat Amazon in the ad domain as well. Under this plan, the firm is also investing heavily in AI infrastructure build.\nRoth MKM analyst Rohit Kulkarni has a Buy rating and $550 price target on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) after attending the Meta Connect conference keynote by CEO Zuckerberg. In a research note following the event, the analyst noted that the key event was marked by Zuckerberg showing off AR prototype glasses after working on them for 10 years, and with 50% of Reality Labs' spend having been earmarked to AR, the next couple of years could see slower growth in incremental spend.

        "Title": "Is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) The Best Morgan Stanley Overweight & Quality Stock?",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently made a list of Morgan Stanley\u2019s Best Overweight & Quality Stocks: Top 25 Stocks. In this piece, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks on the list of the top overweight and quality stocks.\nThe close of September has cemented the paradigm shift on Wall Street. With the Federal Reserve\u2019s first interest rate cut being all that investors could hope for as it reduced rates by 50 basis points, since the cut, the flagship S&P stock index and the broader NASDAQ stock index are up by 2% and 3%, respectively. The rate cut has also now moved Wall Street\u2019s focus to the next big catalyst for the stock market, i.e, the third quarter earnings season.\nFor a market that has touched new highs this year due to artificial intelligence, the second quarter earnings season was nothing short of fireworks. It saw the AI narrative wobble temporarily after mixed results from the world\u2019s leading AI GPU designer and the semiconductor industry reckoned with the fate of the semiconductor manufacturing stock that ranked 5th on the list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Top 12 Must-Watch Stocks.\nStarting with the chip maker, its second quarter earnings were nothing short of a bloodbath. They saw the firm\u2019s non GAAP net income drop by a whopping 85% annually and turn a year ago GAAP net income into a non GAAP loss of $1.6 billion. At the same time, its gross margins dropped by 0.4 percentage points, and in the worst example of the cherry on top, the firm also announced that it will be suspending dividends starting from the fourth quarter. As a result, its shares tanked by 30% after the earnings, and since then, we\u2019ve seen multiple reports claim that other companies are interested in acquiring it.\nAs for the GPU designer, its second quarter revenue jumped by 122% \u2013 a no small feat considering that the year ago quarter\u2019s revenue was $13.5 billion. However, even as the Q2 revenue of $30 billion beat analyst estimates of $28.7 billion which was fueled by its AI data center division\u2019s revenue jumping by 154% annually, the shares fell by 6% in extended trading. At the heart of the fall was a tepid third quarter guidance of $32.5 billion (analyst estimates were $31.77 billion), a gross margin miss by 0.1 percentage point, a Q3 margin guidance miss by 0.5 percentage points, and the delay of its Blackwell GPU to the fourth quarter. For investors already worried about the ability of AI to generate a profit, the margin miss in particular wasn\u2019t comforting. Consequently, since the earnings report, the firm\u2019s shares are down by 1%.\nHowever, investment bank Morgan Stanley sent the GPU designer\u2019s shares soaring by 6.8% in September in a bullish note that shared that the firm could earn $10 billion in its fourth quarter alone from the latest Blackwell chips. This upgrade came on the back of MS remaining consistent in its analysis of the stock market this year. The key themes that it has identified are the labor market, commercial real estate, and the split in the stock market between large and small cap stocks.\nIn July, the bank shared that there was \u201cample room for equities performance to broaden, but this requires a cyclical recovery.\u201d In simpler terms, it means that MS believed that for small cap equities to catch up to large caps in performance, the economy has to perform well. If you\u2019re wondering how wide this gap is, data shows that for small and medium cap and large cap stocks which are in the top 20% in terms of free cash flow margins, the small and mid caps have a forward price to earnings ratio of 0.74x relative to large caps as of April 2024, which is quite low when compared to the April 2009 peak of 1.62x. MS reiterated this belief in its August report, which shared that small cap outperformance \u201crequires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates. While recent inflation data and the resulting decline in rates was a lift to small cap, softer economic data may constrain its continued outperformance.\u201d\nHowever, MS\u2019 September report took somewhat of a different tune. It focused on the clean energy and infrastructure investments in the US to share that these could help some segments of the American stock market that are typically dependent on growth in economic activity. Government spending through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and the CHIPS and Science Act have led to roughly $500 billion in commitments by the private sector to invest in a diverse set of areas ranging from roads, to clean energy manufacturing and heavy industry.\nAs per the bank, \u201cGovernment policies such as the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and the Infrastructure Act are sponsoring growth in many areas of U.S. manufacturing. These trends could offer through-the-cycle structural support to areas of the economy that are traditionally very cyclical.\u201d On the data front, MS reveals that while in 2022, US manufacturing capacity as a percentage of 2017 output sat at ~126%, this has jumped to nearly 129% as of 2024.\nShifting gears, the third quarter earnings season will soon start to shape how investors view the market. Data from LSEG shows that the flagship S&P index is expected to deliver 5.4% annual earnings growth during Q3. FactSet is more cautious, as it shares that the index should grow earnings by 4.6% annually to mark its sixth straight quarter of growth. MS is of the view that the economy has to continue to deliver on the data front if the stock market is to perform well.\nIn a recent podcast, the bank\u2019s chief investment officer and chief strategist, Mike Wilson, shared that \u201cthe unemployment rate will need to decline and the payrolls above 140,000 with no negative revisions to prior months. Meanwhile, I am also watching several other variables closely to determine the trajectory of growth. Earnings revision breadth, the best proxy for company guidance, continues to trend sideways for the overall S&P 500 and negatively for the Russell 2000 small cap index. Due to seasonal patterns, this variable is likely to face negative headwinds over the next month.\u201d\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Morgan Stanley\u2019s best Overweight and quality stocks, we ranked the bank\u2019s recent list of 66 stocks with Overweight ratings, a higher than median quality score, and one month upward EPS revisions by their percentage one month average analyst revisions. The average EPS data was sourced from Yahoo Finance as of September 26th 2024, and the top 25 stocks with non zero percent revisions were selected.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. As of March, the firm had 3.2 billion people using its platform. This provides Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0 with a sizeable moat as the firm is able to woo advertisers to its platform. In fact, advertising is the firm\u2019s bread and butter as it accounted for $74 billion out of its $75 billion in revenue for the first half of 2024. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s sizeable resources, as evidenced by its $32 billion in cash and equivalents have also allowed it to invest heavily into artificial intelligence. It is among the handful of companies that have access to foundational AI models, allowing it to build a portfolio of AI products and services. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is offering these to its advertisers and to its social media users, and given the billions it has spent on AI, monetization and profit from these services will prove to be a key driver of the social media company\u2019s hypothesis.\nEvercore\u2019s Mark Mahaney is quite optimistic about Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s ability to monetize AI. Here\u2019s what he had to say during a recent talk with CNBC:\n\u201cIf you look at what happened with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). they went to almost 30% revenue growth, they are growing dollar-wise faster than anybody else that\u2019s because they used AI to rebuild their ad-tech stack because they used AI to rebuild their user interface and get us more engaged, so it actually worked for them.\u201d\nOverall META ranks 15th when we look at Morgan Stanley's top overweight stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. debuted a new artificial intelligence tool that can generate or edit videos based on a simple text prompt, elevating competition with rivals like OpenAI and Google in the race to develop the world\u2019s most advanced AI technology.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World\u2019s Most Unequal Nation\nChicago\u2019s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil\nFrom Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums\nShould Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters?\nSingapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes\nMeta\u2019s product, Movie Gen, can create a new video up to 16 seconds long based on a text prompt. It can also use such prompts to generate audio for or edit an existing video, or even use a photo to create a customized video featuring a real person.\nMovie Gen is only available for some internal employees and a handful of outside partners, including some filmmakers, though the social media company \u2014 which also owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger \u2014 plans to build the product into its existing apps sometime next year.\nExecutives are still discussing how best to implement this integration, but the aim is for Movie Gen to encourage more people to create or edit video posts, said Connor Hayes, a Meta vice president focused on generative AI products. It will be \u201cfun to use, helpful for creators, good for overall engagement in the apps, but we don\u2019t have a concrete product plan of what it will look like at this point,\u201d he said.\nThe social networking leader is one of many major tech companies pushing into AI models focused on generating videos, which are more complicated and expensive to build than those that return AI-generated text. Microsoft Corp.-backed OpenAI has its own video generation tool, called Sora, that debuted earlier this year and can create videos up to a minute in length, though that technology isn\u2019t available to the public yet. DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, also has a video generation tool, called Veo, which was unveiled earlier this year.\nMeta is waiting to roll out Movie Gen for several reasons, including the technology\u2019s efficiency. It currently takes \u201ctens of minutes\u201d to generate a video based on a text prompt \u2014 too long for general consumers, who are likely to use this on their phone, Hayes said.\nBut Meta is also \u201csorting out a bunch of really important problems around safety and responsibility,\u201d Hayes said, including how to handle personalized videos so that a user can\u2019t create an inappropriate or unflattering video featuring another person without their consent. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be probably the most important problem to solve before we would make the personalization capability available to folks broadly.\u201dThis type of technology has been used in the past to create misleading so-called deepfakes of famous people, including US President Joe Biden and pop star Taylor Swift, though Meta executives have said they\u2019re working on ways to \u201cwatermark\u201d these creations so that people can tell they\u2019re AI-generated.\nMeta has made AI advancements a key priority for the entire company, and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly talked about AI as a driver of user and revenue growth. In the short term, Zuckerberg has credited AI for helping improve the company\u2019s content algorithms by showing people more relevant posts and advertisements. Eventually, Zuckerberg has said he believes AI will play an even larger role in powering its apps and other futuristic wearables Meta is producing, like smart glasses.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMusk Reveals Why He\u2019s Jumping Into Trump\u2019s Arms\nHow Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession\nRate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy\nHamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\nInvestors have been looking for smart ways to play the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has swept the global financial markets over the past two years. Most of the attention in this regard has been confined to obvious choices in semiconductors, software, and biotechnology. Even within these sectors, prominent companies and their AI initiatives have dominated headlines. However, there are several hidden gems within these sectors that offer the same bang for the buck, given present macro context, but are not in limelight as such. For example, Bernie Ahkong, an analyst at UBS, recently noted that the first phase of AI was interest towards chipmakers. In the second phase, investors moved towards the industrial companies which actually supply the components to the data centers. The present tilt towards utility and power firms is quite possibly the third phase of this AI focus.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nA recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute.

        "Text": "The most recent trading session ended with Meta Platforms (META) standing at $584.88, reflecting a -1.86% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.96%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.94%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.18%.\nThe social media company's shares have seen an increase of 19.12% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 7.35% and the S&P 500's gain of 4.3%.\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Meta Platforms in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's earnings report is set to go public on October 30, 2024. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $5.15, indicating a 17.31% growth compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $40.08 billion, up 17.38% from the year-ago period.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $21.36 per share and revenue of $161.62 billion. These totals would mark changes of +43.64% and +19.8%, respectively, from last year.\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system, stretching from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has a noteworthy track record of outperforming, validated by third-party audits, with stocks rated #1 producing an average annual return of +25% since the year 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.3% higher within the past month. Currently, Meta Platforms is carrying a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).\nIn terms of valuation, Meta Platforms is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 27.9. This indicates a discount in contrast to its industry's Forward P/E of 30.53.\nMeanwhile, META's PEG ratio is currently 1.47. The PEG ratio bears resemblance to the frequently used P/E ratio, but this parameter also includes the company's expected earnings growth trajectory. Internet - Software stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.03 based on yesterday's closing prices.\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 74, finds itself in the top 30% echelons of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank assesses the vigor of our specific industry groups by computing the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks incorporated in the groups.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms (META) Is Up 1.07% in One Week: What You Should Know",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\nWhile many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at Meta Platforms (META), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Meta Platforms currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nIn order to see if META is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this social media company holds up.\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\nFor META, shares are up 1.07% over the past week while the Zacks Internet - Software industry is up 0.29% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 12.65% compares favorably with the industry's 0.16% performance as well.\nWhile any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Meta Platforms have increased 8.77% over the past quarter, and have gained 91.56% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 4.59% and 34.78%, respectively.\nInvestors should also take note of META's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, META is averaging 12,462,656 shares for the last 20 days.\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with META.\nOver the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost META's consensus estimate, increasing from $21.27 to $21.36 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\nTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that META is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Meta Platforms on your short list.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "By Supantha Mukherjee\nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Meta Platforms said on Friday it had removed a network of group accounts targeting Russian-speakers in Moldova ahead of the country's Oct. 20 election, for violation of the company's policy on fake accounts.\nAuthorities in Moldova, an ex-Soviet state lying between Romania and Ukraine, said they had blocked dozens of Telegram channels and chat bots linked to a drive to pay voters to cast \"no\" ballots in a referendum on EU membership held alongside the presidential election.\nPro-European President Maia Sandu is seeking a second term in the election and called the referendum on joining the 27-member bloc as the cornerstone of her policies.\nThe fake Meta accounts posted criticism of Sandu, pro-EU politicians, and close ties between Moldova and Romania, and supported pro-Russia parties in Moldova, the company said.\nThe company said its operation centered around about a dozen fictitious, Russian-language news brands posing as independent entities with presence on multiple internet services, including Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram, as well as Telegram, OK.ru and TikTok.\nMeta said it removed seven Facebook accounts, 23 pages, one group and 20 accounts on Instagram for violating its \"coordinated inauthentic behaviour policy\".\nAbout 4,200 accounts followed one or more of the 23 pages and around 335,000 accounts followed one or more of the Instagram accounts, Meta said.\nIn Chisinau, the National Investigation Inspectorate said it had blocked 15 channels of the popular Telegram messaging app and 95 chat bots offering voters money. Users were told the channels \"violated local laws\" on political party financing.\nIt had traced the accounts to supporters of fugitive businessman Ilan Shor - members of the banned party bearing his name or the \"Victory\" electoral bloc he had set up in its place from his exile base in Moscow.\nMoldovan police said on Thursday they searched homes of leaders linked to Shor as part of a criminal investigation into election-meddling. Police have said tens of thousands of voters were paid off via accounts in a Russian bank to derail the vote.\nShor was sentenced to 15 years in jail in absentia last year in connection with the 2014 disappearance of $1 billion from Moldovan banks. He denies allegations of trying to bribe voters.\nSandu accuses Moscow of trying to topple her government while Moscow has accused her of fomenting \"Russophobia\".\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm and Alexander Tanas in Chisinau; Editing by Jane Merriman, Ron Popeski and Bill Berkrot)\n"

        "Title": "Here's How Much You'd Have If You Invested $1000 in Meta Platforms a Decade Ago",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nFOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Meta Platforms (META) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to META for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Meta Platforms' main business drivers.\nMeta Platforms is the world\u2019s largest social media platform. The company\u2019s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta\u2019s family of products used by almost 3.24 billion people on a daily basis as of Mar 31, 2024.Headquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Meta generated revenues worth $134.9 billion in 2023. Advertisement accounted for 97.8% of revenues. Marketers buy ads that can appear on multiple platforms including Meta, Instagram, Messenger and third-party applications and websites.Meta, thanks to its huge user base gained a significant market share in the advertising space wherein it faces tough competition from Google, Twitter, Amazon and Snapchat-parent Snap.Meta also faces significant competition from the likes of Apple (messaging), YouTube (advertising and video), Bytedance (social media) and Tencent (messaging and social media).Meta core app enables people to connect, share, discover and communicate with one other on mobile devices and personal computers. User engagement on core Meta platform is fostered by News Feed that displays an algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements customized for each user.Instagram is a community for sharing photos, videos and messages, enabling people to discover interests that they care about. People can express themselves through photos, videos and private messaging via Instagram Feed and Stories.Messenger helps people to connect with friends, family, groups and businesses across platforms and devices. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable and secure messaging application, used by people and businesses around the world to communicate in a private way.Meta also offers virtual reality (VR) products through its Oculus division.\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Meta Platforms ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in October 2014 would be worth $7,941.48, or a 694.15% gain, as of October 17, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\nThe S&P 500 rose 213.65% and the price of gold increased 107.71% over the same time frame in comparison.\nLooking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for META.\nMeta is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone. It witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 7.22%, and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

It is still unclear how many people were impacted by the changes, which include office relocations and transfers within the company.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.\nThe necessary changes can be a part of these improvements to the team organization and the chosen location strategy. This for instance will involve relocating some of the teams to different places and other employees to new departments, a Meta spokesperson said, adding that the company would indeed look for new positions to place the employees who have been made redundant.\nThe Verge revealed the mass dismissals to the public. They affected numerous departments at Meta, specifically those involved in the company's messaging services, including WhatsApp, its social networking app, Instagram, and a VR division called Meta's Reality Labs. The dismissals show the company's continuous changes after the pandemic, as it expanded rapidly.\nOne of them is software engineer Jane Manchun Wong, who shared the performance and functionalities of social apps before joining Meta in 2023. Wong informed her followers about the impact of layoffs by sharing her situation on Threads, which is an expression of personal anguish.\nThe latest move to cut employees comes after the technology firm Meta made a series of job cuts in the previous years: a major letting go of 11,000 workers that it planned to execute in 2022 and 10,000 others it planned to let go in 2023, a vision that is in line with the firm's chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg announcing 2023 as the year of efficiency. This trend has persisted and represents a careful reinvestment by Meta as it adjusts to the fluctuating environment of the technology market.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "By Byron Kaye\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Meta said it has taken down some 8,000 so-called \"celeb bait\" scam ads from Facebook and Instagram as part of a new effort with Australian banks to curb the practice.\nThe scams use images of famous people, often generated by artificial intelligence, to trick consumers into giving money to non-existent investment schemes.\nThe U.S. social media giant said it took down the scam ads after receiving 102 reports since April from the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange, an intelligence-sharing body run by the country's main banks.\nSuch scams are a global problem, but Meta is under heightened pressure to tackle the issue in Australia with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government planning to introduce an anti-scam law by the end of the year.\nThe bill proposes A$50 million ($34 million) fines for social media, financial and telecommunications companies which fail to meet their obligations to crack down on the practice. A public consultation closes on Oct. 4.\nAustralian scam reports jumped by nearly one-fifth in 2023, with losses totalling A$2.7 billion, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.\nThe commission accused Meta in a 2022 lawsuit of failing to stop the dissemination of cryptocurrency advertisements that used images of celebrities like Mel Gibson, Russell Crowe and Nicole Kidman. It estimated that 58% of cryptocurrency advertisements on Facebook were possible scams.\nMeta is fighting the lawsuit which is yet to go to hearings.\nThe company is also defending a separate civil lawsuit in California brought by Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest who accuses Meta of enabling the publication of thousands of bogus cryptocurrency advertisements on Facebook displaying his face. Forrest says Australians continue to lose money to the scams that he began warning Meta about in 2019.\nDavid Agranovich, Meta's director of threat disruption, told a media briefing that the effort with Australian banks was still in its early stages.\n\"What we find promising is that a small amount of high-value signals can help us identify much wider fraud and scam activity,\" he said, referring to indications within ads about potentially inauthentic content.\nAsked about Meta's view on Australia's proposed anti-scam code, Agranovich said the company was still working through the draft legislation. \"I expect we'll have more to share specifically on that later,\" he added.\nRhonda Luo, head of strategy and engagement at the Australian Financial Crimes Exchange said industry initiatives \"are really important to get ahead of the curve on scams, rather than wait for regulation to come in and have effect\".\n($1 = 1.4535 Australian dollars)\n(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nShares of this social media company have returned +12.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has gained 5.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $21.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +43.6%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.10 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $40.08 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +17.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $161.62 billion and $184.04 billion estimates indicate +19.8% and +13.9% changes, respectively.\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $39.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.91%. The EPS surprise was +9.79%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "In this piece, I evaluated two AI/Big Data stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META). A closer look suggests bullish ratings for both, although a clear winner emerges.\nAlphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, generates revenue from online advertising, sales of apps and content on Google Play and YouTube, and fees on cloud services and other licensing revenue. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, also generates revenue from online advertising.\nShares of Alphabet have tumbled 12% over the last three months, bringing their year-to-date gain to 20%, which accounts for nearly all of the 21% one-year return. In contrast, Meta Platforms stock is up 12% over the last three months for a year-to-date jump of 69% and a one-year bounce of 88%.\nThe two companies\u2019 equally opposite three-month performances create a setup for an interesting matchup, as outlined below.\nAt a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.5x, there\u2019s no ignoring the fact that Alphabet is cheap. While concerns about generative AI could threaten the technology giant, the current P/E is just too cheap to ignore, suggesting a bullish view is in order.\nNotably, advertising still accounts for the lion\u2019s share of Alphabet\u2019s quarterly revenue, including $64.6 billion of the $84.7 billion in total revenue. Google Search alone accounted for $48.5 billion of total revenue. Thus, it\u2019s easy to see why some might give credence to the concerns raised by a fund manager last week. However, I would suggest that his view might be a bit short-sighted, especially since Search revenue is still growing.\nAt the 2024 Quality-Growth Conference last week, Stephen Yiu of Blue Whale Capital explained why he\u2019s bearish on Alphabet right now. He expects generative AI to significantly change Alphabet\u2019s business model, although he does see some upside left in the near term.\nNonetheless, he maintains a negative view due to signs of a market share decline from Google Search, which once held a 90% share. Furthermore, Alphabet\u2019s AI model, Gemini, has yet to meet the expectations set by competing models.\nDespite Yiu\u2019s longer-term concerns for Alphabet, this looks like a buy-the-dip opportunity. On a P/E basis, the shares have been range-bound since about April 2023. However, they\u2019re currently at the bottom of the valuation range, suggesting another leg up could be in the offing soon.\nEven if Alphabet does enter a period of struggle, as Yiu maintains, this company isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. In short, Alphabet is one of those stocks that\u2019s good to buy and hold for the long term, although the size of the position in your portfolio might fluctuate based on valuation.\nThus, I would recommend a small position right now if you don\u2019t already have one, potentially with plans to add a few more shares if you already have a position. After all, Alphabet has more than doubled over the past five years, rising 174%.\nAdditionally, should Gemini deliver positive surprises, Alphabet shares will rise further, potentially breaking out of their current range. We\u2019re already starting to see signs of this with the integration into Google Search and the recent Gemini at Work event, which covered a range of AI use cases for enterprises.\nAlphabet has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 25 Buys, nine Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $200.29, the average Alphabet stock price target implies upside potential of 21.85%.\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\nAt a P/E of 30x, Meta Platforms is trading at a premium to Alphabet, and it\u2019s on the rise after hitting bottom at around 25.5x in early August. Meta has been rangebound for about a year or so on a P/E basis and is approaching the middle of that range. Nonetheless, a long-term bullish view looks appropriate.\nMeta Platforms is less diversified than Alphabet, capturing 98% of its revenue from advertising in the second quarter. This could prevent a problem in the event that digital advertising goes south, though that looks doubtful.\nYiu also commented on Meta Platforms, picking it as his top Magnificent Seven stock aside from NVIDIA (NVDA). He believes that Meta has greater access to personal information than Alphabet, thanks to the interactions occurring across its various platforms. He noted that this provides more personal information about individuals than just searching for things on Google.\nFurther, Yiu mentioned that he believes ads on Meta Platforms will become more personalized through generative AI, which he expects to have a greater impact on Meta than on Alphabet. He argues that personal interactions are more likely to drive immediate purchase decisions compared to Google searches. Additionally, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg supported Yiu\u2019s remarks, stating that AI will allow Meta to offer even more tailored advertisements.\nI would agree with Yiu on these points, but I don\u2019t think Meta will enjoy greater benefits from AI than Alphabet, especially over the long term. Notably, Meta\u2019s ad revenue growth rate reached 22% in the second quarter, double that of Google\u2019s growth rate. However, it\u2019s important to consider that Alphabet\u2019s growth rate was based on a much larger scale versus Meta\u2019s total revenue of $39.1 billion for Q2.\nMeta Platforms has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $607.92, the average Meta Platforms stock price target implies downside potential of 2.54%.\nSee more META analyst ratings\nAlthough both Alphabet and Meta Platforms receive bullish ratings, Alphabet is the clear winner here. Google Cloud revenues continued to rise sequentially, surpassing $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in the second quarter. The Cloud division accounts for Alphabet\u2019s AI revenue, which is critical because AI is already starting to cover for the drop in ad revenue.\nOn the other hand, Meta Platforms is trading at a premium to Alphabet, and it\u2019s verging on overbought territory with a Relative Strength Index of 69.4. Ultimately, I expect Alphabet and Meta to both capture significant AI revenues.\nHowever, Alphabet takes the crown this time around due to valuation and the fact that it was able to put an actual number on AI-related revenue, while Meta just talked about AI making a difference in its revenue growth.\nDisclosure\n"

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) startups have taken the finance world by storm in the past few months. This interest was sparked by the blockbuster launch of ChatGPT by California-based OpenAI in late 2022. Since then, OpenAI has raised tens of billions of dollars in new funding and reached a valuation of over $150 billion. OpenAI revealed earlier this week that it had secured more than $6.6 billion in new funding through a financing round led by prominent names including Thrive Capital, Khosla Ventures, and Tiger Global, among others.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Unsexy AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\nPerhaps one reason the startup is so popular is that it is projecting more than $3.5 billion in revenue this year and over $11 billion in 2025. AI startups in general have been quicker at making revenues than previous technology booms, according to an analysis of payment information by fintech firm Stripe. The report underlines that top AI groups are reaching millions of dollars in sales within a year. This timeline is far faster in the life cycle of a startup than comparable non-AI tech groups. The report relies on annual revenue data for the 100 highest-grossing privately held AI companies using Stripe, compared with a comparable basket of prominent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) start-ups as of July 2018.\nThe report has gained a lot of traction since Stripe customers include OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, GitHub and Midjourney, among others. Stripe claims, per Financial Times, that AI start-ups took a median 11 months to hit $1 million in annual revenue after their first sales on Stripe, compared with 15 months for the previous generation of SaaS companies. AI start-ups that have scaled to more than $30 million in annual revenue achieved the milestone in 20 months \u2014 five times faster than past SaaS companies. Emily Sands, the head of information at Stripe, highlights that unlike past generations of software companies, AI companies paid compute costs straight out of the gate, and were under pressure to build monetisation faster.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. Latest reports, published by tech news website Tech Crunch, claim that the company could use the photos and videos that users take on the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses to train its AI. The smart glasses were announced at a Meta event last month. The report further underlined that Emil Vazquez, the policy communications manager at Meta, had said that where multimodal AI was available, currently US and Canada, images and videos shared with Meta AI may be used to improve it per a Privacy Policy.\nWells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski recently raised the price target on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock to $652 from $647 and kept an Overweight rating on the shares ahead of its earnings report. The advisory predicted another robust quarter and solid forward quarter guide, but noted it was unlikely to materially alter Wells' above-consensus 2025 EPS estimate of $27-plus. The stock is increasingly viewed as an AI winner, but it is likely range bound until 2025 OpEx/CapEx guide on Q4 2024 EPS call, the advisory added.\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks now. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Our comprehensive solution further ensures that brands can close the loop by leveraging insights from their post-bid measurement to optimize campaigns in real-time and maximize media performance.\"\nIn January 2024, DV launched post-bid brand safety and suitability measurement on Meta\u2019s Facebook & Instagram Feeds and Reels. DV classifies content directly above and below the placement of ads \u2013 enabling brands to authenticate the content surrounding their promotions.

        "Title": "3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Meta Platforms (META)",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nMeta Platforms (META) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this social media company a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 18%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 43.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 27.9%.\nGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.67, which means that the company gets $0.67 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.57, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Meta Platforms is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 19.8% this year versus the industry average of 7.4%.\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.3% over the past month.\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Meta Platforms a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Meta Platforms is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Meta Platforms (META): Should You Buy?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Meta Platforms (META).\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.33, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.33 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 46 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 40 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87% and 2.2% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>The ABR suggests buying Meta Platforms, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.3% over the past month to $21.36.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Meta Platforms may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 October 17, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Palantir Technologies Inc PLTR, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s AMD.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nWall Street celebrated the bull market's second anniversary last week, with the S&P 500 ending at record highs. Since Oct. 12, 2022, the broader S&P 500 has soared more than 60% after hitting a closing low of 3,577.03, per the Dow Jones Market Data.\nThe bull market has hardly shown any sign of slowing down in the past two years, mostly due to a resilient U.S. economy and the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). The AI euphoria, in particular, is expected to drive the S&P 500 higher into the year-end and next year. The extensive adoption of AI is expected to boost real GDP growth, increase earnings per share (EPS), and improve the S&P 500's fair value.\nThe AI boom is here to stay since it is based on practical applications. AI can be utilized to increase product efficiency and curtail costs. Two prominent S&P 500 stocks that made the most of the AI revolution are NVIDIA Corp. and Palantir Technologies Inc.\nNVIDIA is known for providing technologies essential for AI applications. The company's graphic processing unit (GPU) is integral to the computer server infrastructure for training large language models and functioning AI interfaces. Palantir's AI software, on the other hand, is widely used, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has been a huge success.\nShares of NVIDIA and Palantir skyrocketed 1002% and 433.9%, respectively, over the past two years. Shares of these tech players are further expected to scale upward, banking on the AI jubilation and more. Let's have a look \u2013\nThe Biden administration's initiative to cap U.S. chip exports to certain countries is surely a dampener for NVIDIA, but the fierce demand for Blackwell chips would boost its share price.\nCEO Jensen Huang recently said that there is an insane demand for Blackwell chips, which are in full production. The high-end Blackwell B200 chip has more AI throughput than the present Hopper H100 chip, leading to increased demand from companies like Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms, Inc..\nDominance in the GPU market space is another tailwind for the NVIDIA stock. NVIDIA holds more than 80% of the GPU market, which is poised to reach $1,414.39 billion by 2034 from $75.77 billion this year, per Precedence Research.\nDevelopers are more inclined toward NVIDIA's more efficient CUDA software platform than Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s ROCm software platform. Hence, the $2.81 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA's earnings per share is up 72.4% from a year ago.\nPalantir is one of the hottest AI players and is largely associated with government contracts. The software company is known for helping the government aggregate its data to save costs and gain efficiency.\nHowever, lately, Palantir has gained interest from commercial customers due to the launch of AIP. In the company's latest quarterly results, commercial revenues in the United States climbed 55% to $159 million, and customer count in the commercial space jumped 83% to almost 300, thanks to the demand for AIP. Notably, Palantir had only 14 U.S. commercial customers four years back.\nPalantir's traditional government revenues also improved 23% in the quarter. Thus, persistent demand for Palantir's AIP, which stands out from the pack, will propel its share prices upward. And with the AI market poised to hit $1 trillion in 10 years, Palantir's shares stand to gain significantly in the long run. As a result, the $0.36 Zacks Consensus Estimate for PLTR's earnings per share is up 33.3% from a year ago.\nOne of the common factors that will drive the share prices of NVIDIA and Palantir is the Federal Reserve's recent move to trim interest rates by 50 basis points in its latest monetary policy meeting. The Fed slashed interest rates after more than two years and penciled in more similar rate cuts soon amid tamed price pressures.\nNow, interest rate cuts bode well for tech players like NVIDIA and Palantir as they curtail the cost of borrowings and jack up profit margins. Similarly, rate cuts don't hinder cash flows, which are essential for both the company's growth initiatives.\nThus, the highest short-term price target offered by brokers for NVDA stock is $200, an upside of 44.9% from the last closing price of $138.07. Analysts' highest short-term price target for PLTR stock is $50, up 15.2% from the last closing price of $43.40.\nNVIDIA stock currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Palantir has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "Title": "Beyond Nvidia and Meta Platforms: 1 Spectacular Vanguard ETF to Buy Now",
        "Author": "  Daniel Foelber, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms\u00a0hit a new intraday high on Oct. 4. Investments in artificial intelligence (AI) are paying off for its core advertising business, and its augmented and virtual reality projects could have potential to contribute earnings growth down the road.\nMeta is now the hottest stock in the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- a group of the largest tech-focused companies. But not long ago, Nvidia\u00a0carried the group higher. And Apple, which had been a significant market laggard earlier in the year, has staged a massive comeback and is up over 33% in the last six months.\nYou may be surprised to learn that every Magnificent Seven stock aside from Meta has been underperforming the S&P 500 over the last three months. The slowdown may be due to valuation concerns that earnings need to catch up with soaring stock prices. Another factor is the broadening of the market rally as stable stalwarts like Coca-Cola, Home Depot, and other blue chip components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average have been roaring higher in recent months and contributing the bulk of index gains.\nIt is useful to be aware of the gyrations of the broader market and major economic events so you know why a stock may be moving a certain way in the short term. But oftentimes, a lot of these movements are just noise and can distract from what investing is all about, which is putting your hard-earned savings to work in companies that can compound in value over time and maybe even return capital to investors through buybacks and dividends.\nHere's why the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: MGK) is packed with compounding potential and is worth buying now.\nInvesting in an ETF can be freeing because it can smooth out individual stock movements by focusing more on a specific theme, sector, or investment objective. The fund can do well even as market leadership changes. It's less about Apple versus Microsoft\u00a0or Meta Platforms versus Google parent company Alphabet\u00a0and more about general industrywide growth.\nOf course, lower risk can mean lower reward because big gains in a single stock can only move an ETF by so much. But overall, the pros of ETFs can outweigh their cons, especially for investors who are looking for a hands-off tool. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is a bold bet on the top growth stocks, especially tech-focused companies.\nHolding\nWeighting in the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF\nApple\n13.5%\nMicrosoft\n12.7%\nNvidia\n11.3%\nAlphabet\n6.7%\nMeta Platforms\n5%\nAmazon\n4.5%\nEli Lilly\n2.7%\nTesla\n2.1%\nVisa\n1.9%\nMastercard\n1.9%\nData source: Vanguard Group.\nA whopping 62.7% of the fund is invested in just 10 holdings, which is a higher concentration than you'll find in an index like the Nasdaq Composite or the S&P 500, or even a similar ETF like the Vanguard Growth ETF. The Growth ETF has the exact same top 10 holdings as the Mega Cap Growth ETF, just less weighting in the top names and 188 total holdings compared to just 71 in the mega cap growth ETF.\nAt its core, the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is a bet on the continued outperformance of the most successful and valuable companies relative to the broader indexes. The Vanguard Mega Cap growth ETF has slightly outperformed the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 over the last 5- and 10-year periods due to the dominance of the largest market-cap growth stocks.\nThere's reason to believe these companies have what it takes to continue leading the broader market higher for years to come.\nMega-cap growth companies should continue doing well as long as they deliver on investor expectations. Solid earnings growth can justify a higher stock price and even valuation expansions. AI, cloud infrastructure, consumer spending, advertising revenue from social media, and enterprise software are all major trends that impact mega-cap tech stocks and are key drivers of earnings growth.\nRecently, Alphabet and Meta Platforms began paying small dividends to pass along profits directly to shareholders -- which is also a capital return strategy deployed by Microsoft and Apple. All four companies buy back a ton of stock to reduce the impact of stock-based compensation and avoid dilution. As these companies continue to mature, their dividends could become an increasingly important aspect of the investment thesis.\nWith an expense ratio of just 0.07% or $0.70 for every $1,000 invested, the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is an ultra-low-cost way to invest in the most valuable growth-oriented U.S. companies. Its top-heavy structure magnifies the impact of a single major holding. For that reason, the fund can be volatile if there's a sell-off in multiple top holdings. Still, it's one of those funds where investors know what they're getting. In other words, if the fund begins underperforming the market, it's probably because there's a sell-off in big tech.\nAll told, the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is an excellent way for long-term investors to target multiple top stocks without incurring sizable fees that can reduce returns over time.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Author": "The Fly ",
        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\nTop 5 Upgrades: \nMoffettNathanson upgraded Roku (ROKU) to Neutral from Sell with an $80 price target. The firm has advised clients to sell Roku's stock over much of the past three years due to a strong conviction that consensus was mismodeling the drivers of Platform revenues, compounded by \"incredibly poor financial disclosure,\" but it has softened its view as it looks into the second half of 2024 and 2025.\nDA Davidson upgraded Datadog (DDOG) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $140, up from $115. The firm's proprietary developer data showed a strong positive inflection point for Datadog, which gives the firm confidence in the trajectory of demand.\nWedbush upgraded Dine Brands (DIN) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $47, up from $34. The firm believes the company's current sales challenges are well understood and reflected in the stock's \"depressed valuation.\"\nSusquehanna upgraded Coherent (COHR) to Positive from Neutral with a price target of $120, up from $80. The firm believes new CEO Jim Anderson, and his platform optimization program, will \"ultimately transform the company's long-term financial model,\" potentially providing the company with over 1,000 basis points of net margin expansion.\nGoldman Sachs upgraded Ford (F) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $13, up from $12. There is a margin opportunity driven by the company's more profitable commercial business - Ford Pro, with mid-teens EBIT margins - and growing software and services mix, and the management's cost actions in internal combustion vehicles and EVs can help to offset industry headwinds, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nRaymond James downgraded Disney (DIS) to Market Perform from Outperform. The firm sees demand moderating at the company's amusement parks after a strong post-COVID surge and says the shares are expected to remain range bound as it contends that consumers are still digesting price increases taken in the past roughly four years.\nWells Fargo downgraded General Dynamics (GD) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $317, down from $334, as the firm is cautious on the company and Boeing (BA) into the Q3 results. General Dynamics' 2024 guidance looked tough to hit at mid-year, and since then G700 deliveries appear to be well behind plan, Wells tells investors in a research note.\nCiti downgraded Hologic (HOLX) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $85, down from $95. The firm believes current fiscal 2025 estimates are too high and will likely need to be lowered, driven by normalization of demand.\nCiti downgraded HP Inc. (HPQ) to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged price target of $37. The firm cites a more cautious view of the PC recovery in the second half of 2024 for the downgrade.\nOppenheimer downgraded Global Payments (GPN) to Perform from Outperform following analyst coverage transfer. Despite the recent stock pullback, the firm remains cautious on Global Payments, particularly as the acquiring industry remains \"intensely competitive.\"\nTop 5 Initiations: \nPivotal Research initiated coverage of Meta Platforms (META) with a Buy rating and $780 price target. The firm sees a \"strong\" revenue growth outlook from increased usage, new products, better targeting and higher prices, boosted by cost efficiencies and eventually materially declining Reality Labs losses combined \"with what appears to be an attractive valuation.\"\nPivotal Research initiated coverage of Alphabet (GOOG) with a Buy rating and $215 price target. If \"the status quo holds,\" Alphabet appears to be in a \"very strong competitive position with a deep moat\" around its dominant core search business model and an \"obvious path\" to leverage its global device presence, strong artificial intelligence platform and \"financial might\" to increase financial incentives to handset manufacturers for default AI placement, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nOppenheimer initiated coverage of SharkNinja (SN) with an Outperform rating and $120 price target. The firm notes the company's management team has executed quite well delivering consistent and well above expectation results in recent quarters, even in difficult U.S. consumer durables backdrop.\nPiper Sandler initiated coverage of Labcorp (LH) with a Neutral rating and $235 price target. The firm sees LabCorp as leading the industry in diagnostics services for decades, but with the stock's run over the last six months, Piper thinks the risk/reward is balanced at these levels.\nArgus initiated coverage of Snowflake (SNOW) with a Hold rating. The company is in a building phase as it invests in new product enhancements, particularly around AI/machine learning which are not generating near-term revenue, even though they may begin to payoff sometime in the future, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n"

META, Cisco Systems, Inc. CSCO and Philip Morris International Inc. PM, Earth Science Tech, Inc. ETST and Frequency Electronics, Inc. FEIM.\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc., as well as two micro-cap stocks Earth Science Tech, Inc. and Frequency Electronics, Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\nYou can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>\nMeta Platforms\u2019 shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+68.9% vs. +24.3%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\nMETA has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone. It witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\nMeta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\nShares of Cisco have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the year-to-date period (+7.8% vs. +7.1%). The company\u2019s business model has evolved with subscription revenues accounting for more than half of its total revenues. Splunk acquisition enhances its recurring revenue base.\nThe buyout significantly expands Cisco\u2019s portfolio of software-based solutions, contributing more than $4 billion in ARR and makes it one of the largest software companies in the world. The launch of AI-powered Hypershield, which combines security and networking, strengthened Cisco\u2019s security portfolio.\nHowever, it has been suffering from sluggish networking sales, primarily due to lackluster demand from telecommunication and cable services providers, as well as stiff competition. Cisco\u2019s prospects are further challenged in the AI-driven networking space due to stiffening competition aggravated by Hewlett Packard\u2019s deal to acquire Juniper.\n(You can read the full research report on Cisco here >>>)\nPhilip Morris\u2019 shares have outperformed the Zacks Tobacco industry over the past three months (+16.2% vs. +14.4%). Robust momentum in smoke-free products, IQOS and ZYN, along with combustible pricing, has been working well for the company. Higher pricing variance and solid cost efforts aided the bottom line amid strong currency headwinds in the second quarter of 2024.\nThe consistent success of IQOS and the noteworthy economics of ZYN have further solidified the company\u2019s position, keeping it well-placed to become a majority smoke-free company by 2030. These upsides encouraged management to raise its guidance for 2024, wherein net revenues are likely to increase 7.5-9% on an organic basis.\nHowever, Philip Morris expects SG&A expenses to remain high in the third quarter due to its planned key commercial activities. The company continues to encounter tobacco leaf inflation.\n(You can read the full research report on Philip Morris here >>>)\nShares of Earth Science have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+143.9% vs. -1.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $512.53 million posted a remarkable 3,796.1% revenue increase to $8.6 million in first-quarter fiscal 2025, largely due to the acquisitions of RxCompound and Peaks. It reported a net profit of $1.1 million against the prior year\u2019s loss.\nRxCompound\u2019s licensing in 22 states provides significant expansion potential, and synergies with Peaks\u2019 telemedicine platform enhance growth opportunities. Despite a strong balance sheet, the company faces risks including reliance on key customers, rising expenses, supplier concentration and regulatory hurdles.\nWhile its 75% gross margin supports profitability, challenges in cost control and supply-chain disruptions could impact future performance. Competitive pressures and share buybacks may also strain resources, challenging future profitability.\n(You can read the full research report on Earth Science Tech here >>>)\nFrequency Electronics\u2019 shares have outperformed the Zacks Instruments - Control industry over the year-to-date period (+19.2% vs. +12.7%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $115.38 million posted strong fiscal Q1 2025 results, with revenues rising 22% to $15.1 million, driven by U.S. government satellite programs. Operating income rose 15% to $2.37 million, reflecting higher margins and cost efficiency.\nFEI\u2019s expansion into the fast-growing satellite market, including low-cost synchronization systems for LEO satellites, positions the company to capitalize on rising demand for smaller, faster-deployed satellites. Additionally, FEI\u2019s quantum technology initiatives, such as magnetometers, provide growth potential. Gross margin reached a 24-year high of 44.4%.\nThe company declared a $1.00/share dividend in July 2024, supported by its debt-free balance sheet and strong cash position. Risks include a 10% backlog decline, negative operating cash flow, rising R&D expenses, and heavy reliance on government contracts, which could introduce revenue volatility.\n(You can read the full research report on Frequency Electronics here >>>)\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Is Meta Platforms Stock a Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) was left for dead during the market downturn in 2022. But it has been a fantastic ride upwards\u00a0since. From the start of 2023 to the end of September of this year, shares have catapulted 376% higher.\nShould investors scoop up this top social media stock, which trades in record territory, today? Here are three reasons why I believe that might be a smart move for your portfolio.\nOne clear reason investors should consider owning this business is because of the presence of network effects. This critical factor is precisely what underpins Meta's economic moat, which helps it fend off existing rivals and new industry entrants, while at the same time supporting long-term success.\nAs of June 30, Meta counted a whopping 3.3 billion daily active users across its family of apps, which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads. People want to use these services because everyone they know does. And the larger the apps get, the more valuable they become because there are exponentially more connections that can be made, with more content being created. \nAnyone with some technical skills and capital funding could in theory launch a new social media app. But with no existing users, it would be almost impossible to attract new people to the service. This highlights just how dominant Meta has become. This business is unlikely to become obsolete anytime soon, especially when you consider that connecting with others is a fundamental human need.\nThe existence of Meta's economic moat is clear when investors realize that the company currently has a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 31%, which is three times higher than the average ROIC of the S&P 500. This metric demonstrates Meta's impressive ability to generate adequate earnings on the money that it reinvests into the business. If the company didn't have a moat, that ROIC figure would be substantially lower.\nMeta's moat has helped drive incredible financial performance over a long period of time. That's another reason that investors should want to buy the stock.\nGrowth has been superb, boosted by the secular trend of digital advertising. In the past decade, Meta has posted a compound annual revenue gain of 29.7%. Given that the global market for digital ads is projected to go from $366 billion in 2022 to over $1 trillion in 2030, there is still a robust expansionary runway for Meta to take advantage of.\nThis is also an extremely profitable enterprise. In the past five years, the company's operating margin has averaged 34.8%. The bottom line has been lifted by cost cuts and a renewed focus on operational efficiencies.\nMeta is in a position of power because it has deep pockets and top-tech talent. The company brought in $10.9 billion in free cash flow last quarter and has $58.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This allows the management team to aggressively invest in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives, particularly around network infrastructure to raise capacity for computing power. \nGiven Meta's strong stock gains in the past couple of years, it's not nearly as attractive from a valuation perspective today. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.2. At first glance, that doesn't look that compelling. But it does represent a 9% discount to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index.\nThe valuation looks better when viewed next to Wall Street's outlook. The analyst community believes earnings per share can grow at a 23.6% annualized pace between 2023 and 2026. It's not unreasonable to assume the solid double-digit gains can continue for several years after.\nMeta is a top-tech company with many favorable qualities. Investors should really consider adding it to their portfolios.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $765,523!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "Text": "Two dozen employees at Meta\u2019s Los Angeles office were terminated for allegedly using company meal credits to purchase groceries, CNN reports.\nIn its investigation, Meta found that employees were violating company policy by using meal vouchers for home goods and personal care items, which is against company policy. Also against company policy is transferring vouchers from the original employee.\nAccording to CNN, Meta supplies food vouchers for employees at offices without food services\u2014breakfast ($20) as well as lunch and dinner ($25)\u2014so they can have meals delivered at work, where the hours can be brutal and down time scant. This was the case at the Los Angeles office.\nBut, according to an internal investigation, Meta learned that some used the vouchers to have food delivered at home or to buy non-food items, a source told CNN.

        "Author": "  Katie Paul ",
        "Text": "By Katie Paul\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Facebook owner Meta announced on Friday it had built a new AI model called Movie Gen that can create realistic-seeming video and audio clips in response to user prompts, claiming it can rival tools from leading media generation startups like OpenAI and ElevenLabs.\nSamples of Movie Gen's creations provided by Meta showed videos of animals swimming and surfing, as well as videos using people's real photos to depict them performing actions like painting on a canvas.\nMovie Gen also can generate background music and sound effects synced to the content of the videos, Meta said in a blog post, and use the tool to edit existing videos.\nIn one such video, Meta had the tool insert pom-poms into the hands of a man running by himself in the desert, while in another it changed a parking lot where a man was skateboarding from dry ground into one covered by a splashing puddle.\nVideos created by Movie Gen can be up to 16 seconds long, while audio can be up to 45 seconds long, Meta said. It shared data showing blind tests indicating that the model performs favorably compared with offerings from startups including Runway, OpenAI, ElevenLabs and Kling.\nThe announcement comes as Hollywood has been wrestling with how to harness generative AI video technology this year, after Microsoft-backed OpenAI in February first showed off how its product Sora could create feature film-like videos in response to text prompts.\nTechnologists in the entertainment industry are eager to use such tools to enhance and expedite filmmaking, while others worry about embracing systems that appear to have been trained on copyright works without permission.\nLawmakers also have highlighted concerns about how AI-generated fakes, or deepfakes, are being used in elections around the world, including in the U.S., Pakistan, India and Indonesia.\nMeta spokespeople said the company was unlikely to release Movie Gen for open use by developers, as it has with its Llama series of large-language models, saying it considers the risks individually for each model. They declined to comment on Meta's assessment for Movie Gen specifically.\nInstead, they said, Meta was working directly with the entertainment community and other content creators on uses of Movie Gen and would incorporate it into Meta's own products sometime next year.\nAccording to the blog post and a research paper about the tool released by Meta, the company used a mix of licensed and publicly available datasets to build Movie Gen.\nOpenAI has been meeting with Hollywood executives and agents this year to discuss possible partnerships involving Sora, although no deals have been reported to have come out of those talks yet. Anxieties over the company's approach increased in May when actor Scarlett Johansson accused the ChatGPT maker of imitating her voice without permission for its chatbot.\nLions Gate Entertainment, the company behind \"The Hunger Games\" and \"Twilight,\" announced in September that it was giving AI startup Runway access to its film and television library to train an AI model. In return, it said, the studio and its filmmakers can use the model to augment their work.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York; Additional reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Mark Porter)\n"

        "Title": "Meta confirms it may train its AI on any image you ask Ray-Ban Meta AI to analyze",
        "Author": "  Maxwell Zeff ",
        "Text": "We recently asked Meta if it trains AI on photos and videos that users take on the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. The company originally didn't have much to say.\nSince then, Meta has offered TechCrunch a bit more color.\nIn short, any image you share with Meta AI can be used to train its AI.\n\"[I]n locations where multimodal AI is available (currently US and Canada), images and videos shared with Meta AI may be used to improve it per our Privacy Policy,\" said Meta policy communications manager Emil Vazquez in an email to TechCrunch.\nIn a previous emailed statement, a spokesperson clarified that photos and videos captured on Ray-Ban Meta are not used by Meta for training as long as the user doesn't submit them to AI. However, once you ask Meta AI to analyze them, those photos fall under a completely different set of policies.\nIn other words, the company is using its first consumer AI device to create a massive stockpile of data that could be used to create ever-more powerful generations of AI models. The only way to \"opt out\" is to simply not use Meta's multimodal AI features in the first place.\nThe implications are concerning because Ray-Ban Meta users may not understand they're giving Meta tons of images \u2013 perhaps showing the inside of their homes, loved ones, or personal files \u2013 to train its new AI models. Meta's spokespeople tell me this is clear in the Ray-Ban Meta's user interface, but the company's executives either initially didn't know or didn't want to share these details with TechCrunch. We already knew Meta trains its Llama AI models on everything Americans post publicly on Instagram and Facebook. But now, Meta has expanded this definition of \"publicly available data\" to anything people look at through its smart glasses and ask its AI chatbot to analyze.\nThis is particularly relevant now. On Wednesday, Meta started rolling out new AI features that make it easier for Ray-Ban Meta users to invoke Meta AI in more natural way, meaning users will be more likely to send it new data that can also be used for training. In addition, the company announced a new live video analysis feature for Ray-Ban Meta during its 2024 Connect conference last week, which essentially sends a continuous stream of images into Meta's multimodal AI models. In a promotional video, Meta said you could use the feature to look around your closet, analyze the whole thing with AI, and pick out an outfit.\nWhat the company doesn't promote is that you are also sending these images to Meta for model training.\nMeta spokespeople pointed TechCrunch towards its privacy policy, which plainly states: \"your interactions with AI features can be used to train AI models.\" This seems to include images shared with Meta AI through the Ray-Bans smart glasses, but Meta still wouldn't clarify.\nSpokespeople also pointed TechCrunch towards Meta AI's terms of service, which states that by sharing images with Meta AI, \"you agree that Meta will analyze those images, including facial features, using AI.\"\nMeta just paid the state of Texas $1.4 billion to settle a court case related to the company's use of facial recognition software. That case was over a Facebook feature rolled out in 2011 called \"Tag Suggestions.\" By 2021, Facebook made the feature explicitly opt-in, and deleted billions of people's biometric information it had collected. Notably, several of Meta AI's image features are not being released in Texas.\nElsewhere in Meta's privacy polices, the company states that it also stores all the transcriptions of your voice conversations with Ray-Ban Meta, by default, to train future AI models. As for the actual voice recordings, there is a way to opt-out. When you first login to the Ray-Ban Meta app, users can choose whether voice recordings can be used to train Meta's AI models.\nIt's clear that Meta, Snap, and other tech companies are pushing for smart glasses as a new computing form factor. All of these devices feature cameras that people wear on their face, and they're mostly powered by AI. This rehashes a ton of privacy concerns we first heard about in the Google Glass era. 404 Media reported that some college students have already hacked the Ray-Ban Meta glasses to reveal the name, address, and phone number of anyone they look at.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/02/meta-confirms-it-may-train-its-ai-on-any-image-you-ask-ray-ban-meta-ai-to-analyze/\n"

After gathering public comments it can issue non-binding policy recommendations to Meta.\nThe first case the board shared relates to a Facebook page of a Polish far-right coalition party that posted a meme in May using a term for Black people widely considered to be offensive and derogatory in Poland, the board said.\nThe post was viewed over 150,000 times, shared over 400 times, has more than 250 comments and was reported 15 times by users for hate speech but was left on Facebook following a human review by Meta, it said.\nIn the second case, a German Facebook page in June uploaded a picture of a blond-haired, blue-eyed woman holding up her hand in a stop gesture, with text saying that people should no longer come to Germany as they don\u2019t need any more \"gang rape specialists\".\nMeta decided to leave up the image after human review.\nAfter the Oversight Board raised the issue, Meta\u2019s policy subject matter experts reviewed both posts again but confirmed its original decisions were correct.\n\"These symbolic cases from Germany and Poland will help us determine whether Meta should be doing more and whether it is doing enough to prioritise this critical issue that matters to so many around the world,\" board co-chair and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said.\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; Editing by Toby Chopra)\n"

        "Title": "Meta Platforms or Microsoft: Oppenheimer Chooses the Superior AI Stock to Buy",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "The tech sector has been powering market gains over the past year, and AI stocks have been at the forefront of tech. AI has the potential to overturn the tech world and recast the general economy; in doing so, it also has the potential to be a gold mine for investors.\nBut not every AI stock will fully realize that potential. Some are clearly going to lead in innovation or bring higher returns, and Wall Street\u2019s analysts are busy now sorting out the equity landscape to find those shining opportunities.\nCovering the AI/tech world from Oppenheimer, two 5-star analysts are taking divergent views on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Both companies have been making waves in the AI world lately; Microsoft was an early backer of generative AI, while Meta has recently been finding innovative ways to use the technology.\nSo, let\u2019s take a closer look to find out which one is the investment bank\u2019s choice as the superior AI stock to buy.\nMeta Platforms\nWe\u2019ll start with Meta, the parent firm of Facebook and the world\u2019s leader in the social media field. The company was founded as Facebook, 20 years ago; in 2021, after Facebook had made several social media acquisitions, the company rebranded as Meta Platforms. Today, Meta owns and operates Facebook, as well as Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Through these platforms, the company can reach out to a huge audience \u2013 at the end of 2Q24 this year, Meta reported a Daily Active People (DAP) number of 3.27 billion, or nearly 40% of the world\u2019s total population. An audience of that magnitude is an asset that cannot be discounted.\nMeta\u2019s audience-asset lies at the heart of the company\u2019s chief revenue driver, digital advertising. This is Meta\u2019s core business, and in the second quarter of this year, the last quarter reported, the company showed a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across its platforms \u2013 as well as a 10% increase in the average price paid per ad. That led to a 22% year-over-year revenue gain, to a quarterly top line of $39.07 billion \u2013 a figure that also beat the forecast by $760 million. At the bottom line, Meta beat the Q2 forecast again, with the $5.16 EPS coming in 40 cents per share ahead of expectations.\nSolid revenues and consistent profits are only part of the story, however. Meta has been preparing itself to meet the future of the online world \u2013 and understands that that future is AI. The company is no stranger to AI tech, having put it to use in developing targeted digital advertising over the past several years, and using AI in its translation algorithms to make its social media platforms more widely accessible.\nBut the real work is in generative AI, and Meta has two chief developments in this field. The first is Llama, Meta\u2019s open-source AI software model. The company has already released Llama 3, and aims to use the platform to create a flexible and readily usable AI environment. Making the platform open-source allows users to develop tweaks and additions that will meet idiosyncratic needs, as well as permitting the public to make improvements.\nIn addition to Llama, Meta has released an online AI chatbot/assistant, dubbed Meta AI. This interactive tool is available across all of the company\u2019s social platforms, and has rapidly become a successful addition to the company\u2019s toolbox \u2013 and popular with users. The chatbot had 400 million monthly active users at the end of August this year, with that number trending upwards quickly. Meta created Meta AI as a gen AI challenger to ChatGPT, and is well on that path.\nFor Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein, the most important factor here is Meta AI. He notes the recent expansion of the online assistant, and lays out how it will benefit the company as a whole. \u201cMETA AI on track to be most-used AI assistant by year-end, ~500M MAU, with more country launches,\u201d the 5-star analyst explained. \u201cWe believe the long term benefits from AI content recommendation, ad targeting, business messaging and ads generation will become more exciting to investors overtime, and support META\u2019s terminal value. We believe China ecommerce remains strong, with results/guidance implying continued acceleration on 2-year growth (and no cautionary comments). Near term, we are also encouraged from the positive commentary surrounding US Facebook and Whatsapp young adult engagement.\u201d\nThese comments support Helfstein\u2019s Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, although his price target of $615 implies a modest 4% gain on the 12-month horizon, a low upside that is indicative of the stock\u2019s continued gains (up 68% year-to-date). (To watch Helfstein\u2019s track record, click here)\nOverall, META shares have a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street\u2019s analysts, based on 46 recent reviews that include 42 to Buy, 3 to Hold, and 1 to Sell. However, due to the strong rally, the average target price of $611.20 suggests an upside of just 3% over the coming year. (See Meta stock forecast)\nMicrosoft Corporation\nNow on to another tech giant. Microsoft made its name in the 70s and 80s as a leader in the PC market, and now its Windows operating systems and Office software packages have become the industry standard for home, small business, and enterprise-level PCs and laptops. Microsoft has managed this through a combination of developing quality products that do what the user needs and wants \u2013 and through smart marketing, making its Windows logo one of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands. Today, Microsoft boasts a market cap of $3.08 trillion and is the world\u2019s third-largest publicly traded company.\nLike Meta above, Microsoft has not been resting on its laurels. The company reached the top of the heap on its track record of proven products, and it\u2019s using its deep resources and long expertise to adapt itself to the changes that AI is bringing to the world of tech. One of the most prominent of Microsoft\u2019s uses of AI is the integration of the AI-powered Copilot online assistant feature to its Windows and Office software packages.\nMicrosoft has been able to do this by building on its status as an early backer of generative AI tech. The company put billions into OpenAI, the firm that brought ChatGPT to the market \u2013 $13 billion, more precisely. In return for that investment, Microsoft has secured rights to 75% of OpenAI\u2019s future profits. Microsoft\u2019s royalties will drop to 49% once the initial investment is recouped.\nThe company\u2019s large AI investment hasn\u2019t just brought it an additional income stream \u2013 Microsoft has also been able to integrate generative AI technology into its search engine, Bing. Bringing AI to the search engine has made the engine more responsive to natural language queries and improved search results, both of which make the search feature easier to use and more competitive with Google.\nAI has also become ever-more important to Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing system, Azure, which competes with Google\u2019s Cloud and Amazon\u2019s AWS. Azure already has more than 200 cloud-based software tools available to subscribers, and adding AI to the mix provides enhancements and greater flexibility for users.\nBuilding out all of these AI features and tools, and adding them to existing platforms, does not come cheap \u2013 but as noted, Microsoft has deep pockets. And the company has buttressed that with consistent revenue growth. In the last quarter reported, fiscal 4Q24, the company brought in $64.7 billion at the top line, beating the forecast by $260 million and growing 15% year-over-year. The company\u2019s earnings came to $2.95 per share, up 10% y/y and 2 cents per share ahead of the forecast.\nThe company\u2019s Azure cloud segment, however, grew at a slower pace than expected \u2013 rising 29% y/y compared to the 30% to 31% revenue growth that analysts were looking for.\n5-star analyst Timothy Horan, however, is more worried about potential slowdowns and headwinds in the AI field. In his Oppenheimer note on MSFT, Horan explains his position, \u201cWe believe estimates for revenue and EPS are too high. Open AI losses are the primary concern and could be in the $2-3B range in FY25, which we were not previously modeling. As per our recent AI report, enterprises have been slow to adopt AI and associated revenues will likely disappoint. Other factors include the impact of heightened CapEx on higher depreciation, lower interest income and higher OpEx to support AI. Because MSFT are investing in once-in-a-generation technology, we don\u2019t believe expanding margins will be a short-term priority. MSFT is trading at the midpoint of its five-year range of ~25x-35x P/E, and could trade to the lower end.\u201d\nHoran follows this by downgrading his stance on MSFT from Outperform to Perform (Hold) and withholding a price target for the stock. (To watch Horan\u2019s track record, click here)\nWhile the Oppenheimer view is cautious, Wall Street remains bullish on Microsoft. The 30 recent reviews, including a lopsided 22 to 3 Buy-Hold ratio, give the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating, while the $504.73 average target price and $414.71 trading price together suggest a 22% gain on the one-year horizon.

        "Text": "Meta has announced the expansion of an information-sharing partnership with banks to help protect people against fraud. The Fraud Intelligence Reciprocal Exchange (FIRE) is a threat intelligence sharing programme for financial institutions, allowing banks to share intelligence with Meta directly so Meta can use it to stop scammers and protect users. NatWest and Metro Bank are the first banks in the UK to participate in this pilot, with more scheduled to join.\nNathaniel Gleicher, Global Head of Counter-Fraud at Meta, said: \u201cThis work has already seen us take action against thousands of accounts run by scammers, indicating the importance of banks and platforms working together to tackle this societal issue. We will only beat these criminals if we work together and share relevant information related to scams. Financial institutions can share unique information with us which we can in turn use to train our systems to take action against more scams globally.\u201d\nKey successes from the initial pilot include the takedown of a significant concert ticket scam network attempting to target people in the UK and US. Thanks to data shared between NatWest, Metro Bank and Meta during the six month pilot, facilitated under the cross-collaborative umbrella of Stop Scams UK, Meta was able to remove approximately 20,000 accounts run by scammers from the 185 URLs shared, which in turn has helped the company to strengthen its fraud detection capabilities.\nFeedback following the initial pilot stage has been positive and Meta will now onboard more banks over the coming months as we continue to test and learn. NatWest is one of the banks to have partnered with Meta.\nDavid Lindberg, CEO of Retail Banking, NatWest, said: \u201cSpotting and stopping fraudsters before they are able to target customers is the best way to address this growing problem.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus News ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.\nAs of 2024-10-14, Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $616.91. It's currently trading at a price of $589.95. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 4.37%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$19.74\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.1%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 35.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n700.31\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n1046.93\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n616.91\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $588.38. This valuation indicates that the Meta Platforms Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -0.27%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance.

        "Text": "ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) \u2014 Meta's oversight board expressed serious concern Tuesday over the company's failure to take down a viral graphic video showing two men bleeding after they were apparently beaten up for being allegedly gay.\nThe video was posted in Nigeria, one of more than 30 of Africa\u2019s 54 countries where homosexuality is criminalized by laws that garner broad public support despite constitutional guarantees of freedoms. Such laws are often used to target and illegally arrest people suspected of being gay, with abuses against them often ignored.\nThe report said the damage done by the video, which was viewed more than 3.6 million times between December 2023 and February this year, was \u201cimmediate and impossible to undo.\u201d\nThe board said the content \u201cshared and mocked violence and discrimination\u201d and though reported multiple times and reviewed by three human moderators, it stayed on Facebook for about five months despite breaking four different rules.\n\u201cWith the video left up, the odds of someone identifying the men and of the post encouraging users to harm other LGBTQIA+ people in Nigeria increased,\u201d the panel said. \u201cEven after it was removed, the Board\u2019s research shows there were still sequences of the same video remaining on Facebook.\u201d\nIn the video, two men were seen bleeding as a crowd of people interrogated them about their identity and sexual orientation.\nMeta couldn\u2019t be reached for immediate comment.\nThe company admitted two errors regarding the said video, the panel said, in that its automated systems identified the language spoken in the video as English while it was the Igbo language spoken in southeastern Nigeria \u201cbut not supported by Meta for content moderation at-scale,\u201d and that Meta\u2019s human review teams also misidentified the language as Swahili.\n\u201cThis raises concerns about how content in unsupported languages is treated, the choice of languages the company supports for at-scale review and the accuracy of translations provided to reviewers working across multiple languages,\u201d the panel said.\nIn its report, the board recommended Meta update its Coordinating Harm and Promoting Crime Community Standard to include clear examples of \u201couting-risk groups,\u201d conduct an assessment of enforcement accuracy of the prohibition on exposing the identity or locations of those alleged to be a member of such groups, ensure language detection systems identify content in unsupported languages and provide accurate translations while routing content for review.\n"

        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "With the S&P 500 index notching a new all-time high, it's not surprising that many of its constituents are doing the same. One of the largest companies in that index is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and other social media sites.\nInvestors may shy away from buying stocks that have reached fresh all-time highs. However, this is a mistake, as these companies are usually executing at a very high level if they're achieving new highs. Meta falls into this category, and I think the latest round of new record highs could be extended for some time.\nMeta Platforms runs some of the most successful social media sites, but some may be confused by how this makes so much money. Because these platforms are free to use, investors must realize that the users are the products being sold. In Meta's case, it sells advertising that allow advertisers to target users based on demographics, preferences, and location.\nThis highly successful business model allowed Meta's stock to reach new heights. In the second quarter of 2024, Meta's advertising segment generated $38.3 billion in revenue, up 22% year over year. This accounted for 98% of Meta's overall revenue, so it clearly controls the company's direction.\nIt's also massively profitable, with Meta's Family of Apps division generating operating income of $19.3 billion in the quarter ended June 30. If this were the only part of Meta's business, the stock would likely be much higher, as it would have more resources to return to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks or dividends.\nHowever, Meta is using some of that money to fund its other endeavors.\nAnother part of Meta is its Reality Labs division, home of its augmented- and virtual-reality projects. While consumers saw some of these devices come to market as gaming headsets, a lot of money is put into Meta's pursuit of making everyday smart glasses that can be used for multiple tasks.\nThe public finally saw what these glasses look like with Meta's demonstration of its Orion augmented-reality glasses. The use case for these glasses remains to be seen, but investors now have an idea of what Meta is spending its money on, which gives them hope that eventually, they will see some return on that investment.\nWe're likely a long way off from seeing meaningful revenue generated by these devices -- the Reality Labs division lost $4.5 billion in the second quarter -- but it gives an idea of where Meta is heading.\nHowever, I still think this is not a factor in an investing thesis for Meta, as its base advertising business is still excelling. If these Orion glasses turn out to be a hit, then that will be a cherry on top.\nDespite its fresh all-time highs, the stock is still priced at a point where it's not overvalued.\nMeta's stock is valued at the highest point it has been all year from a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) basis, but it's still cheaper than many companies it's commonly compared to within the big tech space.\nCompany\nForward P/E Ratio\nLast Quarter YoY Revenue Growth\nApple\n34\n4.9%\nMicrosoft \n32.8\n15.2%\nNvidia\n43.7\n122.4%\nAlphabet\n21.3\n13.6%\nAmazon\n40.5\n10.1%\nMeta Platforms\n26.6\n21.7%\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n28.3\n32.9%\nData source: YCharts. YoY = year over year.\nMeta Platforms is an optimal compromise between its valuation and growth. This will likely cause it to consistently notch new all-time highs for the foreseeable future, making it a top stock to buy now.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "MoneyShow ",
        "Text": "One complaint with young people today is that \u201csocial media is destroying them\u201d in various ways. In this environment, wouldn\u2019t it be smart for a social media CEO to say his company is\u00a0definitely not\u00a0social media? It\u2019s really about connecting family and friends in a positive, uplifting way? Welcome to\u00a0Snap Inc.\u00a0(SNAP), highlights\u00a0Michael Murphy, editor of\u00a0New World Investor.\nJust Released:\u00a0The Golden Era: 3 Powerful Forces Driving Precious Metals Higher (& How YOU Can Profit!) Report\nSnap bills itself as a camera company, but what they really offer is an image- and video-based social media experience. They were founded in 2010 as Snapchat, a visual messaging app that has evolved to offer various choices such as Camera, Visual Messaging, Snap Map, Stories, and Spotlight. They enable people to communicate visually for free through short videos and images. SNAP also has a popular subscription service, Snapchat+ with over 11 million members, that offers extra functions.\nSnap has a loyal and somewhat different demographic from\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s\u00a0(META) Instagram, which essentially copied their idea. The company is smaller than Meta and spends much less on R&D, but they can copy what Mark Zuckerberg does in monetizing their user base with advertising.\nSince I recommended Meta in April 2018 at $159.34, the stock has way more than tripled. Meanwhile, SNAP is selling near its lows.\nBut is it cheap? Snap recently had an $18 billion market capitalization. It traded for 8.4x book value (which includes $3.1 billion in cash), 3.5x sales per share, and 27.9x the 2025 average consensus earnings estimate of 37 cents per share. That doesn\u2019t look especially cheap on the surface, although it\u2019s not out of line for a big technology company today.\nBut let\u2019s look under the hood. Revenues are growing around 15% a year and I think that rate will accelerate over the next few years. That average 2025 EPS of 37 cents is in a huge range from 23 cents to 64 cents, and analysts have consistently underestimated SNAP.\nSnap has served more than 75% of 13- to 34-year-olds in over 25 countries. Today, approximately 80% of Snapchatters are above the age of 18. In the June quarter, global content viewers grew 12% year-over-year, and\u00a0global time spent watching content grew 25% year-over-year\u00a0and 10% quarter-over-quarter. Monetizing that is Snap\u2019s opportunity to continue to beat Wall Street estimates and attract Buy recommendations.\nSee also: MSFT: Investing in Capex AND Rewarding Shareholders in the Process\nRecommended Action: Buy SNAP.\n(Editor's Note: To download The Golden Era: 3 Powerful Forces Driving Precious Metals Higher (& How YOU Can Profit!)

        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "Meta faces yet more restrictions on its core ad business in Europe, following a ruling by the EU\u2019s top court.\nIn its Friday ruling, the Court of Justice of the EU confirmed that the principle of \u201cdata minimization\"\u2014one of the many rules in the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation\u2014means a social network like Facebook can\u2019t simply use all of a user\u2019s data, forever, for the purpose of targeting ads at them.\n\u201cMeta has basically been building a huge data pool on users for 20 years now, and it is growing every day,\u201d said Katharine Raabe-Stuppnig, the lawyer representing the complainant in the case, Max Schrems.\n\u201cFollowing this ruling only a small part of Meta\u2019s data pool will be allowed to be used for advertising\u2014even when users consent to ads. This ruling also applies to any other online advertisement company that does not have stringent data deletion practices.\u201d\nMeta said in a statement that it would have more to share once it has read the court\u2019s full judgment. \u201cMeta takes privacy very seriously and has invested over \u20ac5 billion [$5.5 billion] to embed privacy at the heart of all of our products,\u201d said a spokesperson.\nSchrems, an Austrian activist lawyer who has been a thorn in Facebook\u2019s side ever since he was a law student 13 years ago, has been the catalyst for a series of Court of Justice rulings against the company.\nTwo of the rulings sank entire data-sharing agreements between the EU and the U.S.\u2014owing to Meta\u2019s inability to stop U.S. intelligence agencies from poking around its data.\nA separate Schrems complaint last year led to a $1.3 billion GDPR fine against the company and left it perilously close to being unable to send Europeans\u2019 personal data off to its U.S. data centers at all; the belated authorization of a third EU-U.S. data-sharing agreement provided a last-minute reprieve.\nIn a case involving German antitrust law rather than Schrems, the Court of Justice last year blew up Meta\u2019s legal justification for targeted advertising, forcing it to rely on users\u2019 consent. Meta then tried to force that consent by telling users they had to either agree to targeted advertising or pay a monthly fee, but the EU\u2019s privacy regulators rejected that approach after Schrems complained.\nSchrems told Fortune he was happy with Friday\u2019s ruling as, until now, Meta and other online advertisers \u201csimply used all data they could get, without limit as to the type or age of such data.\u201d\nThis latest Schrems case revolved around his sexuality. The lawyer disclosed in a panel discussion, which was broadcast online, that he was gay\u2014but he never mentioned that fact on his Facebook profile. Nonetheless, Facebook showed him ads targeting that attribute.\nThe GDPR classifies personal data about sexuality as being sensitive, meaning it must be more tightly controlled. However, if the data subject makes their own sexuality public, that can effectively remove the \u201csensitive\u201d classification, making it easier to use the information for things like ad targeting.\nApart from what it had to say about data minimization, Friday\u2019s ruling threw the issue of whether or not Schrems had made his sexuality public back to the Austria Supreme Court, which had referred the case. But the Court of Justice also said that, either way, Meta doesn\u2019t get to target ads based on sexuality data it got through other means, such as tracking Schrems\u2019s activities on other websites.\nMeta\u2019s spokesperson stressed that the company doesn\u2019t use \u201cspecial categories\u201d of data, such as sexuality, for ad targeting.\n\u201cWe also prohibit advertisers from sharing sensitive information in our terms, and we filter out any potentially sensitive information that we\u2019re able to detect. Further, we\u2019ve taken steps to remove any advertiser targeting options based on topics perceived by users to be sensitive,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Carter Pape ",
        "Text": "On Wednesday, Meta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, announced a partnership program with U.K. banks to share fraud data for purposes of, for example, removing accounts on the platform that are run by scammers.\nThe program, named the Fraud Intelligence Reciprocal Exchange, or FIRE, kicked off six months ago in a pilot stage facilitated by Stop Scams UK, a private sector not-for-profit company that leads cross-industry collaboration against scams between banking, telecommunications and technology.\nDuring the pilot stage, two banks shared fraud data with Meta: NatWest and Metro Bank. The intel enabled the social media platform to take down 20,000 accounts run by scammers, including Facebook and Instagram accounts, based on information from 185 URLs shared.\nCreating a Facebook or Instagram account, as with most social media platforms, only requires an email or phone number. While Facebook's policies technically require users to use their real name to sign up, enforcement is mainly complaint-based; new account holders do not typically need to verify their real name. This makes it relatively simple to create multiple accounts to proliferate the same scam.\nIn 2021, social media was the single biggest starting point for scams against Americans aged 18-59; 31% of people in that age range who reported losing money to a scam said that the scheme started on social media, according to data from the Federal Trade Commission. Among adults 60 years or older, that percentage was 15%.\nThe feedback from the FIRE pilot has enabled the platform to secure commitments from additional banks \"scheduled to join,\" according to the company's press release. This, the company hopes, will help with identifying and stopping more scam-promoting accounts.\n\"We will only beat these criminals if we work together and share relevant information related to scams,\" said Nathaniel Gliecher, global head of counter-fraud at Meta. \"Financial institutions can share unique information with us which we can in turn use to train our systems to take action against more scams globally.\"\nNatWest and Metro Bank executives said such cross-sector collaboration is important to fraud prevention.\n\"Partnering with Meta is an important step in tackling the epidemic of fraud,\" said David Lindberg, CEO of retail banking at NatWest. \"We welcome the opportunity to deepen our collaboration and ensure a cross-industry approach to fraud prevention and enforcement.\"\nMetro Bank's Chief Operating Officer Faisal Hussain echoed the sentiment, adding that information sharing with Meta will hopefully \"improve scam detection and enforcement\" significantly.\nAdrian Searle, director of the National Economic Crime Centre, said the pilot's expansion was \"welcome news.\"\n\"It follows the establishment of the Online Fraud Charter in 2023, in which leading tech companies signed a voluntary agreement, recognising and seeking to reduce the risk of fraud and financial exploitation of UK citizens on their platforms,\" Searle said.\nNik Adams, temporary assistant commissioner of the City of London Police, also cited the Online Fraud Charter as pivotal to the launch of FIRE and praised Meta's scam reporting channel.\nThe Online Fraud Charter is a voluntary agreement between the U.K. government and large technology companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, X and many others.\nThe charter compels signatories \"take a proactive approach to implementing new technologies and processes which seek to prevent the facilitation of fraud on their respective platforms,\" according to U.K. law firm Reynolds Porter Chamberlain.\nMark Tierney, CEO of Stop Scams UK, said projects such as FIRE can lead to \"wider data sharing,\" which would help with reporting and successfully tackling scams.\n\"We're delighted to see some of our member banks join Meta's FIRE initiative in another positive example of cross-sector collaboration,\" Tierney said. \"We believe FIRE could become a game changer for reporting fraudulent content, helping protect consumers and ensuring both banks and Meta gain better visibility of the abuse carried out on their systems by scammers.\"\n"

Rivals have come under fire for widely scraping the internet to build AI models.\nAdobe\u2019s video models were trained primarily on videos and photos from its vast library of stock media for marketers and creative agencies, Greenfield said. In some cases the San Jose, California-based company used public domain or licensed data, he added. Adobe has offered to procure videos for about $3 per minute from its network of creative professionals.\nOpenAI\u2019s demonstration of its video-generation model Sora earlier this year ignited investor fears that Adobe could be disrupted by the new technology. The company\u2019s shares declined 17% this year through Friday\u2019s close.\nAdobe isn\u2019t yet charging for the use of its AI features beyond its standard subscription fees. Each user is allotted a number of credits for AI generations, but the limits aren\u2019t being enforced for most plans, Greenfield said. In the future, Adobe may charge more to use its video-focused AI than its similar tool for photos, company executives have said.\nAt its conference, Adobe also announced improvements to other software, such as making it easier to view 3D content in Photoshop. The company also is working on developing AI models that can generate 3D graphics.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nBYD Is Winning the Global Race to Make Cheaper EVs\nNeuralink Co-Founder\u2019s New Startup Sells a Brain Computer Toolkit\nA Fentanyl Vaccine Is a Long Shot That Just Might Work\nHow Starbucks Became a Sugary Teen Emporium\nThe World\u2019s Central Banks Aren\u2019t Following the Fed\u2019s Lead Anymore\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

The only time he had publicly revealed this fact was during a panel discussion.\n\u201cAn online social network such as Facebook cannot use all of the personal data obtained for the purposes of targeted advertising, without restriction as to time and without distinction as to type of data,\u201d the court said in a press release summarizing its decision.\nEven though Schrems revealed he was gay in the panel discussion, that \u201cdoes not authorise the operator of an online social network platform to process other data relating to his sexual orientation, obtained, as the case may be, outside that platform, with a view to aggregating and analysing those data, in order to offer him personalised advertising.\u201d\nMeta said it was awaiting publication of the court's full judgment and that it \u201ctakes privacy very seriously.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone using Facebook has access to a wide range of settings and tools that allow people to manage how we use their information,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nSchrems' lawyer, Katharina Raabe-Stuppnig, lawyer representing Mr Schrems, welcomed the court's decision.\n\u201cMeta has basically been building a huge data pool on users for 20 years now, and it is growing every day. However, EU law requires \u2018data minimisation\u2019,\" she said in a statement. \u201cFollowing this ruling only a small part of Meta\u2019s data pool will be allowed to be used for advertising \u2014 even when users consent to ads.\u201d\n"

        "Author": "  Kells McPhillips ",
        "Text": "Despite their unquestionable convenience, at-home workouts have their limits. You don\u2019t get direct access to the instructor or practice alongside your fellow students. And you definitely don\u2019t get the intangible \u201cvibe\u201d of the third space so many of us crave. By entering the new frontier of virtual reality, companies are trying to create an entirely new way to exercise in your own space, one that doesn\u2019t leave you missing an in-class experience. That, instead, creates an entirely new vision of what at-home movement can look and feel like.\nWith the launch of its app on the Meta Quest 3, Alo Yoga has made a giant bet on the world of mixed reality\u2014the word for the combination of the physical and virtual worlds that exist inside these headsets. The Alo Moves app delivers virtual instructors straight into your living room so you can complete five- to 30-minute classes, including yoga, Pilates, or meditations\u2014that feel more immersive than your typical at-home workout class. Imagine a hologram of your favorite yoga instructor where your coffee table should be, a backdrop of an ocean paradise right behind them. This may sound like something straight out of a science fiction movie, but it\u2019s very real and launched on the VR headset on Oct. 10.\nEager to explore this virtual yoga studio for myself, I tried a beta of the Alo Moves app. To date, Meta has sold at least 1 million Meta Quest 3 headsets, but as I unpacked the device (which weighs about 18 ounces), I realized how unprepared I was for mixed reality. The process of learning how to turn on and navigate the virtual world brought to mind the first time I played with the iPhone 1 in 2007. The device felt foreign, vast, and new.\nEventually I hopped on a phone call with Magnopus, the team Alo Moves partnered with to bring its teachers into the meta-sphere. The company is staffed by Oscar-winning visual effects artists working together to \u201cunite the physical and digital world.\u201d The team got to work teaching me how to move through mixed reality, which essentially maps your environment (for example, your living room) before layering the virtual components atop your physical reality.\nIt took some getting used to, but eventually I felt comfortable enough in my new habitat to unroll my yoga mat and collect the block, bolsters, and yoga strap I always have on hand. I queued up a yoga class taught by one of the brand\u2019s top teachers, Ashley Galvin. She appeared before me, life-size and sporting the company\u2019s signature slick athletic wear. Though she didn\u2019t look \u201creal,\u201d she definitely felt more physically present than the 2D version of her I\u2019d grown accustomed to seeing on my computer screen when I practiced with Alo Moves. The ocean roared behind her, virtual waves lapping on the shore.\nAlo Moves and Magnopus have developed these semi-lifelike conditions using volumetric capture, which uses synchronized cameras to capture a 3D view of a landscape or person. \u201cThis level of immersion fosters a deeper connection and provides a much clearer understanding of movement, especially for beginners,\u201d said AJ Sciutto, director of future production at Magnopus.\nAs the 10-minute class began, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the weight of the Meta Quest 3. It felt heavy and unnatural on my head, especially in poses where gravity wasn\u2019t my friend\u2014like downward dog and forward fold. The discomfort took me out of the moment, but there were some pros to enduring the strange feeling of the headset.\nFor one, Alo Moves has introduced mini-instructors, or shrunken-down versions of Galvin that you can place next to your mat and rotate using the hand tracking (a setting that allows you to control your experience with your hands instead of the controllers) on the Meta Quest 3. This means that you can see a pose from all angles and tweak your own form to match, a fantastic feature for beginners and seasoned yogis alike.\nI also found that the Meta Quest 3 created a barrier between myself and the \u201creal world.\u201d While this definitely felt a little disorienting at first, it had the effect of helping me focus on the yoga class, even though I so often get distracted by dishes, laundry, and work when I work out from home. This feeling that I was both in my space and not added to the pros of this mixed reality experience.\nAs I removed the Meta Quest 3, I kept thinking about how unstoppable mixed reality will be once the headsets are replaced with thin glasses or, better yet, contact lenses. Startup augmented reality brand Mojo Vision developed a prototype for the latter technology before ceasing to work on it after the company couldn\u2019t drum up more funding. Still, it\u2019s possible that this technology will be in our hands sooner than we think.\nAs of now, the headset technology feels too bulky to replace my trips to the local studio or good old laptop yoga sessions. Perhaps that will change after Alo Moves launches its full batch of augmented classes later this year. For now, I\u2019m sure that the AR natives who are already used to the extra 18 ounces will love the opportunity to flow in their living room turned tropical yoga retreat.\nMore on workouts:\nWhat is the 12-3-30 workout?\u00a0\nJust how much exercise do I need each week, according to experts\nHow to stay in shape in your 30s, 40s, and 50s\nHow 30-second micro-workouts can boost your energy and help you get fit\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

This spending is largely concentrated on building data centers, acquiring specialized hardware, and optimizing cloud infrastructure. According to a report by McKinsey, global AI infrastructure spending could reach up to $500 billion by 2027, highlighting the critical role it plays in the future of AI development. A large part of this investment is focused on AI-specific hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are crucial for training and deploying AI models. NVIDIA, a dominant player in AI chips, has seen demand for its GPUs soar, largely due to their centrality in deep learning tasks. Jensen Huang, the CEO of the firm, has remarked that the AI boom is underpinned by massive infrastructure needs, and the market is just at the beginning of this growth curve.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nData centers are another focal point for AI infrastructure spending. AI workloads are highly demanding, requiring specialized facilities that can support high-density computing environments. Blackstone\u2019s $16 billion acquisition of AirTrunk, a leader in AI-driven data centers, underscores the increasing importance of such infrastructure. The deal will add 800 MW of data center capacity, with projections to grow beyond 1 GW, a testament to the rising demand for infrastructure to support AI-driven applications. Cloud infrastructure is also a major area where companies are pouring resources. Cloud giants are increasing their investments in AI infrastructure. These companies are developing new AI-optimized cloud services to cater to businesses adopting AI. Gartner predicts that by 2026, cloud AI infrastructure spending will surpass $200 billion, as enterprises increasingly shift from on-premise AI deployments to scalable cloud-based solutions.\nThomas Kurian, the CEO of Google Cloud, recently remarked that AI is unlocking entirely new revenue streams for enterprises, and cloud infrastructure is the backbone enabling this transformation. Beyond just hardware, organizations are also investing in data management platforms and storage solutions to handle the massive amounts of data AI systems require. In fact, estimates suggest that the global AI data infrastructure market will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18%, driven by increased data volumes and the need for real-time data processing capabilities. Companies are significantly ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, focusing on hardware, data centers, and cloud computing. With projections showing continued growth in AI workloads, this spending will only increase in the coming years.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases.

        "Title": "Code in Meta's Threads app references a communities feature, similar to Elon Musk's X",
        "Author": "  Sarah Perez ",
        "Text": "Meta's take on a Twitter/X rival, Instagram Threads, may be inching further into its competitor's territory with the development of a communities feature that would presumably allow users to better organize their discussions on the platform by topics. At least that's what references in the app's code seem to imply.\nThe code mentions a new feature, called Loops, which was spotted on Monday by Threads early adopter and veteran technologist Chris Messina. The new strings he discovered were introduced in the latest app update and mention things like the joining and leaving of \"Loop\" communities, as well as fields that refer to the community name, bio, and other elements. (In addition, mentions of \"BCN\" in the code refer to Barcelona, the internal code name for Threads ahead of its launch; \"TextApp\" serves as a similar reference.)\nReached for comment, Instagram did not confirm its plans for these Loop communities or what the feature may entail. However, the company did say the feature was in early development and is not testing either internally or externally at this time.\nWhile X's Communities have not been a standout addition as of yet, X owner Elon Musk has high hopes for their further growth. Since acquiring the social network, Musk has promoted X Communities' growth and improvement. Earlier this April, he reshared a post that touted how X members were spending 495% more time in Communities, and time spent was up over 600% year-over-year. He also often shares or reshares posts about Communities updates, like the addition of an Explore tab, the ability for moderators to pin posts, timeline sorting options, and other changes that could help X's feature challenge Reddit's communities, known as subreddits.\nMusk last year also noted that X was deprecating the private sharing feature, Circles, in favor of improved Communities.\nIntroducing a similar Communities feature on Threads could also make sense, not only because it makes the app more competitive with X, but also because it reflects how Threads users have begun to organize themselves on the platform.\nSince Threads did away with the traditional hashtag in favor of a different type of hyperlinked tag for following topics, users began tagging their posts to reach different groups using the format of \"topic name\" followed by the word \"Threads.\" For example, you can follow tags like \"Tech Threads,\" \"Design Threads,\" \"Fitness Threads,\" \"Sports Threads,\" and so on.\nHowever, this system can be confusing because it's not based on the hashtag that users are already familiar with, and some people include a space between the topic and the word \"Threads\" while others do not.\nCreating communities to organize topical discussions could be a potential solution to the problem, while also perhaps adding a moderation layer.\nMessina is not the only one to have spotted Loops. Reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi also found the feature earlier this month and showed how it may look in action. He noted that Threads was working on adding a Loops shortcut to the composer and the home header, as well.\nUpdated, 10/8/23, 1:43 pm et with additional image from Paluzzi.\n"

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2347643/the-cheapest-mag-7-stocks-in-2024\nWelcome to Episode #385 of the Value Investor Podcast.\n\u00a0\n(0:30) - Can You Find Value Within The Magnificent 7?\n(6:15) - Breaking Down Recent Performances: What Stocks To Keep On Your Radar?\n(28:30) - Episode Roundup: META, GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, NVDA, TSLA\n Podcast@Zacks.com\n\u00a0\nEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.\nIt\u2019s time to check in on the Mag 7 stocks, formerly known as FAANG stocks or FANGMAN stocks. The Mag 7 stocks are the large cap innovators with high growth. The Mag 7 includes Tesla, NVIDIA, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple and Meta Platforms.\nTracey has often discussed how value investors can own both growth and value stocks. Value investors are not limited only to value stocks.\nWhy not look at the largest big cap growth stocks out there? Why not own some Mag 7 stocks?\nBut just because a value investor might buy a growth stock, doesn\u2019t mean that investor doesn\u2019t want attractive valuations. A \u201ccheap\u201d stock, for value investors, doesn\u2019t mean the share price. Cheapness is not talking about a stock under $1.00. Cheapness means the company\u2019s valuations are attractive.\nFor value investors, valuations are often determined by looking at the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. P/E ratios are usually the first default though, so Tracey looked at them for this podcast.\nThe P/E ratio is price divided by earnings.\nBut there\u2019s a good case for the P/S ratio, especially when looking at technology stocks.\nTracey considers both on the podcast.\n1. Tesla, Inc. TSLA\nTesla has underperformed so far in 2024. Shares of Tesla are down 3.1% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 19.4%.\nBut the sell-off doesn\u2019t mean Tesla is cheap. It\u2019s trading with a forward P/E of 113, which is at the nosebleed levels. And it has a P/S ratio of 8.7. That\u2019s not cheap but at least it\u2019s under 10.\nIs Tesla a deal on the weakness or is it a value trap?\n2. Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN\nHas Amazon EVER been cheap? Investors have always paid a premium for the stock, at least on a P/E basis. But Amazon is currently trading with a forward P/E of 39, which is among its lowest P/E ratios over the last decade.\nShares of Amazon have gained 19% year-to-date yet it\u2019s still sporting an attractive P/E. Earnings are expected to rise 63.5% this year and 23% next year, which explains it.\nBut it is Amazon\u2019s P/S ratio which is the real surprise. It has P/S ratio of just 3.2, the lowest of the Mag 7.\nShould Amazon be on a value investor\u2019s short list?\n3. NVIDIA Corp. NVDA\nNVIDIA can\u2019t be a deal, can it? It has been one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street this year. Shares of NVIDIA are up 157.9% year-to-date. But earnings are also expected to be up 116% this year and another 33% in fiscal 2026.\nNVIDIA is trading with a forward P/E of \u201cjust\u201d 41.5. But that is well under Tesla at 113x, and other growth stocks like Costco, which is trading at 49x.\nIs NVIDIA still a buy here?\n4. Apple Inc. AAPL\nWarren Buffett might have sold a bunch of his Apple position in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio this year, but he still owns a big chunk of shares. And if the greatest value investor ever owns your stock, there must be some value there, right?\nBut Apple isn\u2019t that cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 30. Earnings are expected to be up this year, but just 9.3%. Shares of Apple have gained 15.1% year-to-date.\nIs Apple losing its shine with value investors in 2024?\n5. Meta Platforms, Inc. META\nMeta Platforms has been a quiet winner in 2024. Shares of Meta Platforms are up 65.2% year-to-date.\nIt\u2019s a growth stock. Earnings are expected to rise 43.6% this year and another 12.8% next year. But Meta Platforms also has an attractive forward P/E of just 27. And it\u2019s now paying a dividend, yielding 0.4%.\nIs Meta Platforms the cheapest Mag 7 stock?\nTune into this week\u2019s podcast to find out.\n[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of GOOGL, MSFT and AMZN in her personal portfolio.]\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "College grads struggle to find work at Google, Amazon, and Meta as tech hiring stalls",
        "Author": "  Jenn Brice ",
        "Text": "When the current class of college seniors started their studies four years ago, tech companies were hiring new graduates as fast as they could. Now, amid a downturn in Silicon Valley that has included thousands of layoffs, job seekers who are about to get their diplomas are scrambling to find work.\nThe signs of trouble are easy to spot at University of California at Berkeley, usually a hotbed for tech recruiting.\nSome of the Big Tech companies have pulled out of recruitment and branding partnerships they previously had with the campus career services office.\nIt\u2019s taking longer for students to land jobs. To make themselves more marketable, some students are doubling down on courses in AI and data engineering, two areas that haven\u2019t been hit as hard as others in the tech industry.\nMeanwhile, many students are applying for jobs at smaller companies now that Big Tech\u2019s Google, Amazon, and Facebook-parent Meta have cut tens of thousands of workers over the past two years.\n\u201cStudents are frustrated,\u201d Santina Pitcher, senior associate director of employer relations at U.C. Berkeley\u2019s career center, tells Fortune.\nThe unease among job seekers is being felt across the country. Once a sponge for new graduates, the tech industry has cut back on filling high-paying jobs and is far more selective.\nSo far this year, tech companies laid off nearly 140,000 workers, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks job cuts. That\u2019s on top of more than 264,000 people cut from tech last year.\nThings won\u2019t necessarily get better anytime soon for college graduates. Silicon Valley is increasingly using artificial intelligence to help software engineers speed up the process of writing code, reducing the need for hiring more programmers.\nIn a potential sign of the shift, job postings for software engineers have fallen more than 160% since post-pandemic hiring peaked in March 2022, according to data from Indeed, the online job board. That\u2019s a far bigger drop than for non-tech roles.\nIn response to the souring market, young professionals are seeking tech jobs outside the usual suspects, such as with small businesses and government, according to new data from Handshake, a recruiting site for college students. It found that 42% of today\u2019s computer science students have applied for full-time jobs at small businesses, up from around 25% in 2022.\nOf any college major, that\u2019s the largest jump in interest in small businesses, defined as having 250 workers or less. Such companies may not have the perks of bigger ones like ping-pong tables and offsite retreats at wellness ranches, but they can offer more stable roles and a direct social impact on local communities, Handshake\u2019s report notes.\nAnother report by Handshake in May found that the Class of 2024 is applying to more government jobs. About 7.5% of job applications from new grads were for public sector work, up from 5.5% for the Class of 2023.\nOverall, the job market is relatively strong. The U.S. added 254,000 jobs in total in September, according to federal government employment data. The gains were largely driven by hiring in the education and health sectors, leisure and hospitality, and government. In contrast, the information services sector, which includes the tech industry, grew slowly, contributing less than 10,000 jobs last month.\nAt Berkeley, the shift in the tech industry is having a big impact. The number of employers showing up at STEM-major career fairs has remained relatively stable since the pandemic at around 100. But aside from Alphabet\u2019s self-driving car unit Waymo, Big Tech is absent. Instead, the sponsors include Bloomberg and TikTok, along with the U.S. State Department and the Peace Corps.\n\u201cI'm seeing more interest from startups and smaller companies, and the bigger ones are backing off a little bit,\u201d Pitcher said.\nAt Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, a similar trend is playing out, said Kevin Collins, associate director of the campus career center. Students must work harder to land roles than they did before the pandemic. His advice: Look beyond the usual online job boards, attend networking events, and be more open minded about employers.\n\u201cThey're still doing tech roles, but they're doing it in different industries and smaller companies in general,\u201d Collins said.\nCarnegie Mellon is known for strong robotics and computer science programs, and its graduates have historically been snapped up by the likes of Google and Uber. This year it topped College Transition\u2019s list of schools that feed talent to Silicon Valley.\nAnd while there are still opportunities for new grads in Big Tech, Collins said, huge West Coast tech companies have scaled back their once aggressive campus recruiting efforts since the pandemic. Instead, some tech students are taking jobs in traditional industries, like financial services, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably a healthier market in the sense it is broader,\u201d Collins said.\nMadeleine Brutin knew the job market would be competitive when she started as a Carnegie Mellon student in 2022. The day she got her university email address, she says she messaged the career services office. As a freshman, she\u2019d already heard from upperclassmen about the competitiveness of the job market, as companies rescinded offers amid post-pandemic downsizing.\nSearching for a full-time position is still stressful today, Brutin said.\n\u201cYou can go months or days without hearing from a company, and you're at a fork in the road where you're wondering should you apply more? Should you build more skills? Or should you just keep waiting?\u201d she said.\nBrutin, who studies computational finance, looked beyond the Silicon Valley \u201cpure tech\u201d companies. While still job hunting, she already secured an offer for a full-time position at Bloomberg after previously interning there.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Katie Paul ",
        "Text": "By Katie Paul\nNEW YORK - Facebook owner Meta said on Friday it was releasing a batch of new AI models from its research division, including a \"Self-Taught Evaluator\" that may offer a path toward less human involvement in the AI development process.\nThe release follows Meta's introduction of the tool in an August paper, which detailed how it relies upon the same \"chain of thought\" technique used by OpenAI's recently released o1 models to get it to make reliable judgments about models' responses.\nThat technique involves breaking down complex problems into smaller logical steps and appears to improve the accuracy of responses on challenging problems in subjects like science, coding and math.\nMeta's researchers used entirely AI-generated data to train the evaluator model, eliminating human input at that stage as well.\nThe ability to use AI to evaluate AI reliably offers a glimpse at a possible pathway toward building autonomous AI agents that can learn from their own mistakes, two of the Meta researchers behind the project told Reuters.\nMany in the AI field envision such agents as digital assistants intelligent enough to carry out a vast array of tasks without human intervention.\nSelf-improving models could cut out the need for an often expensive and inefficient process used today called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, which requires input from human annotators who must have specialized expertise to label data accurately and verify that answers to complex math and writing queries are correct.\n\"We hope, as AI becomes more and more super-human, that it will get better and better at checking its work, so that it will actually be better than the average human,\" said Jason Weston, one of the researchers.\n\"The idea of being self-taught and able to self-evaluate is basically crucial to the idea of getting to this sort of super-human level of AI,\" he said.\nOther companies including Google and Anthropic have also published research on the concept of RLAIF, or Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback. Unlike Meta, however, those companies tend not to release their models for public use.\nOther AI tools released by Meta on Friday included an update to the company's image-identification Segment Anything model, a tool that speeds up LLM response generation times and datasets that can be used to aid the discovery of new inorganic materials.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Alistair Bell)\n"

        "Text": "By Supantha Mukherjee\nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) -Meta Platforms said on Friday it had removed a network of group accounts targeting Russian-speakers in Moldova ahead of the country's Oct. 20 election, for violation of the company's policy on fake accounts.\nAuthorities in Moldova, an ex-Soviet state lying between Romania and Ukraine, said they had blocked dozens of Telegram channels and chat bots linked to a drive to pay voters to cast \"no\" ballots in a referendum on EU membership held alongside the presidential election.\nPro-European President Maia Sandu is seeking a second term in the election and called the referendum on joining the 27-member bloc as the cornerstone of her policies.\nThe fake Meta accounts posted criticism of Sandu, pro-EU politicians, and close ties between Moldova and Romania, and supported pro-Russia parties in Moldova, the company said.\nThe company said its operation centered around about a dozen fictitious, Russian-language news brands posing as independent entities with presence on multiple internet services, including Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram, as well as Telegram, OK.ru and TikTok.\nMeta said it removed seven Facebook accounts, 23 pages, one group and 20 accounts on Instagram for violating its \"coordinated inauthentic behaviour policy\".\nAbout 4,200 accounts followed one or more of the 23 pages and around 335,000 accounts followed one or more of the Instagram accounts, Meta said.\nIn Chisinau, the National Investigation Inspectorate said it had blocked 15 channels of the popular Telegram messaging app and 95 chat bots offering voters money. Users were told the channels \"violated local laws\" on political party financing.\nIt had traced the accounts to supporters of fugitive businessman Ilan Shor - members of the banned party bearing his name or the \"Victory\" electoral bloc he had set up in its place from his exile base in Moscow.\nMoldovan police said on Thursday they searched homes of leaders linked to Shor as part of a criminal investigation into election-meddling. Police have said tens of thousands of voters were paid off via accounts in a Russian bank to derail the vote.\nShor was sentenced to 15 years in jail in absentia last year in connection with the 2014 disappearance of $1 billion from Moldovan banks.

        "Title": "Meta Unveils AI Video Generator, Taking On OpenAI and Google",
        "Author": "  Kurt Wagner ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. debuted a new artificial intelligence tool that can generate or edit videos based on a simple text prompt, elevating competition with rivals like OpenAI and Google in the race to develop the world\u2019s most advanced AI technology.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nUrban Heat Stress Is Another Disparity in the World\u2019s Most Unequal Nation\nChicago\u2019s $1 Billion Budget Hole Exacerbated by School Turmoil\nFrom Cleveland to Chicago, NFL Teams Dream of Domed Stadiums\nShould Evictions Be Banned After Hurricanes and Climate Disasters?\nSingapore Ends 181 Years of Horse Racing to Make Way for Homes\nMeta\u2019s product, Movie Gen, can create a new video up to 16 seconds long based on a text prompt. It can also use such prompts to generate audio for or edit an existing video, or even use a photo to create a customized video featuring a real person.\nMovie Gen is only available for some internal employees and a handful of outside partners, including some filmmakers, though the social media company \u2014 which also owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger \u2014 plans to build the product into its existing apps sometime next year.\nExecutives are still discussing how best to implement this integration, but the aim is for Movie Gen to encourage more people to create or edit video posts, said Connor Hayes, a Meta vice president focused on generative AI products. It will be \u201cfun to use, helpful for creators, good for overall engagement in the apps, but we don\u2019t have a concrete product plan of what it will look like at this point,\u201d he said.\nThe social networking leader is one of many major tech companies pushing into AI models focused on generating videos, which are more complicated and expensive to build than those that return AI-generated text. Microsoft Corp.-backed OpenAI has its own video generation tool, called Sora, that debuted earlier this year and can create videos up to a minute in length, though that technology isn\u2019t available to the public yet. DeepMind, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, also has a video generation tool, called Veo, which was unveiled earlier this year.\nMeta is waiting to roll out Movie Gen for several reasons, including the technology\u2019s efficiency. It currently takes \u201ctens of minutes\u201d to generate a video based on a text prompt \u2014 too long for general consumers, who are likely to use this on their phone, Hayes said.\nBut Meta is also \u201csorting out a bunch of really important problems around safety and responsibility,\u201d Hayes said, including how to handle personalized videos so that a user can\u2019t create an inappropriate or unflattering video featuring another person without their consent. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be probably the most important problem to solve before we would make the personalization capability available to folks broadly.\u201dThis type of technology has been used in the past to create misleading so-called deepfakes of famous people, including US President Joe Biden and pop star Taylor Swift, though Meta executives have said they\u2019re working on ways to \u201cwatermark\u201d these creations so that people can tell they\u2019re AI-generated.\nMeta has made AI advancements a key priority for the entire company, and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly talked about AI as a driver of user and revenue growth. In the short term, Zuckerberg has credited AI for helping improve the company\u2019s content algorithms by showing people more relevant posts and advertisements. Eventually, Zuckerberg has said he believes AI will play an even larger role in powering its apps and other futuristic wearables Meta is producing, like smart glasses.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMusk Reveals Why He\u2019s Jumping Into Trump\u2019s Arms\nHow Jellycat Plushies Became a Gen Z Obsession\nRate Cuts Need Time to Work Their Way Through the Economy\nHamas Struck Israel to Spark a Wider Conflict.

(NYSE:PLTR) are among the artificial intelligence stocks that have seen strong gains since early to mid-September. While the former is perched at a record high, the latter, despite its recent strong run, is yet to reclaim its Jan. 2021 peak.\nHere\u2019s a look at the relative performance of these two stocks and what the near-term holds for them:\nMeta Vs. Palantir: Meta has gained over 68% for the year-to-date period, while Palantir is up a steeper 133%. The data analytics company co-founded by Peter Thiel is the fourth best-performing S&P 500 company this year, while Meta, co-founded by Mark Zuckerberg, holds the 11th spot on the list.\nDon\u2019t Miss Out:\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.This is a paid advertisement.

Find out how.\nBoth stocks have outperformed the broader market, as represented by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) \u2013 an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500 Index.\nValuations of both stocks have become expensive following the recent spike. The forward price-earnings ratio for Palantir is currently at a hefty 95.2 but Meta is trading at a more modest forward P/E valuation of 24.75. The social media giant\u2019s P/E ratio is fairly in line with 21.3 which is applicable to the communications services sector.\nThe Palantir Rally: Palantir has been on an uptrend since it gap-opened higher on Sept. 9, the first session after the S&P Dow Jones Indices said the company would be added to the S&P 500 Index, effective prior to the start of trading on Sept. 23. Commenting on the feat, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said, \u201cThe profitability profile of this story has significantly been bolstered with this another validation moment for the Palantir story.\u201d\nAlthough there was a \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news\u2019 moment after the inclusion, the stock has been grinding solidly higher since the start of October.\nMeta Connects With Investors: After the early August broader market swoon set in motion by yen carry-trade unwinding, Meta\u2019s stock found its feet shortly after and climbed higher until mid-August. The stock experienced a mild pullback that lasted through mid-September.\nThe two-day Meta Connect conference held on Sept. 25-26 saw the company announcing a slew of products and other offerings. These include AI-driven chatbots, an updated Llama large-language model, the latest Ray-Ban smart glasses with improved camera functionality, voice controls, and deeper integration with AI, Meta Quest 4, the next-generation virtual reality headset, and the Orion augmented reality glasses.\nThe stock has been on a steady climb since then.\nTrending: Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market.

The average analysts\u2019 price targets, compiled by TipRanks, suggest modest upside potential for Meta but downside for Palantir.\n\n\nCurrent Price\n1-Year Average Analysts\u2019 Price Target\nUpside/Downside Potential\nMeta\n$595.94\n$608.20\n+2.06%\nPalantir\n$40.01\n$27.67\n(-30.84%)\nThe next big catalyst for Meta is likely to be the company\u2019s third-quarter results due on Oct. 30, with the consensus modeling over 30% earnings per share growth and nearly 20% revenue growth. Meta\u2019s fortunes to a large extent is tied to ad spending, which in turn hinges on macroeconomic conditions. With the Fed showing a proclivity to take rates down in the coming months, credit conditions could ease, potentially benefiting Meta.\nPalantir is a favorite among retail investors. Continuing deal flow, and strong third-quarter results and positive fourth-quarter guidance could keep the upward momentum intact.\nMore importantly, the market has entered a seasonally strong quarter when a confluence of factors typically lifts the market. The stretched valuations, therefore, may not preclude further gains. That said, investors may remain wary of geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds, with two wars ongoing and a hard-landing scenario still not off the table.\nWondering if your investments can get you to a $5,000,000 nest egg?

It\u2019s also available as a voice assistant in the social media giant\u2019s smart glasses and mixed reality headsets. Almost 500 million people use Meta AI each month, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said last month.\nMeta AI will be available beginning Wednesday in the UK, Brazil and additional countries in Latin America and Asia, the company announced in a statement. Along with the expansion, the chatbot will also add support for new languages, including Tagalog on Wednesday and Arabic and Thai in the near future. Eventually, Meta AI will be available in 43 countries and a dozen languages, the company said.\nZuckerberg has focused the company since last year on adding artificial intelligence to its products, a strategy that is credited for some recent user growth and advertising success. The emphasis on AI, which requires spending huge amounts of money in computing power, is a pivot away from the company\u2019s earlier attention on the metaverse, a virtual world for work and play. The shift has appealed to investors, who have driven the shares up 67% this year compared with a 20% jump in the S&P 500.\nMeta earlier this year had also planned to launch its AI chatbot in the EU, before facing regulatory pushback. The company\u2019s large language model, called Llama, is trained in part using public posts on Facebook and Instagram. In June, Meta announced plans to start training Llama on posts from European users, but just days later said it would pause those plans indefinitely after the Irish Data Protection Commission pushed back on its decision. At the time Meta said it still planned to bring the product to Europe, but declined to share a timeline.\nA Meta spokesperson said the company didn\u2019t have anything further to share about its plans to expand the chatbot to the EU.\nMeta\u2019s products have faced regulatory challenges in the EU over the company\u2019s handling of personal data. In July, the EU warned Meta that it risked fines for making Europeans pay to block their data on Instagram and Facebook from being used for ads. Last week, the EU\u2019s Court of Justice ordered Meta to stop using data related to a person\u2019s sexuality for ad targeting.\nAlong with the expansion of Meta AI across its apps, the chatbot will also be available on the Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the UK and Australia.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhy OpenAI Is at War With an Obscure Idea Man\nHow Airbnb Hosts and Frustrated Neighbors Can Find Common Ground\nChina Is Playing Catch-Up to Elon Musk in Space\nInside the Companies That Set Sports Gambling Odds\nJamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary: The Idea That Never Fades\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"
