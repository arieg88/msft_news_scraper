        "Text": "Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) boasts a market cap exceeding $1 trillion and is a member of the renowned \"Magnificent Seven.\" Operating primarily in two segments, Family of Apps and Reality Labs, its productsFacebook, Instagram and WhatsAppare integral to people's daily lives. Founded 20 years ago, the company went public in 2012 and has since grown into a tech powerhouse.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision has propelled Meta to an impressive start this year, maintaining the momentum from last year. Known for its extensive portfolio of social networking apps, the company has been aggressively integrating AI across its platforms to enhance user engagement and monetize its vast user base. Despite a 30% year-to-date rally, Meta Platforms remains relatively undervalued within the Magnificent Seven group. The gains have been fueled by robust quarterly results and strong revenue growth, positioning the company to leverage AI to strengthen its core advertising business further.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META.\nThe company's substantial investments in generative artificial intelligence has led to successful monetization, significantly boosting advertising revenue and margins. Additionally, Meta's shares have nearly quintupled from their 2022 lows, driven by a relentless focus on efficiency, the success of Reels and best-in-class ad targeting capabilities in a post-app tracking transparency landscape. As Reels monetization reaches neutrality and AI integration continues to receive significant attention and resources from Zuckerberg, investors are once again optimistic about the company's future.\nDespite its impressive performance and record-high share price, I believe Meta has significant upside potential. This optimism is grounded in its strong fundamentals and strategic AI integration across its family of apps. Further, I see substantial growth potential for Meta despite its already impressive achievements.\nIn April 2021, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced the app tracking transparency framework with an iOS update, disrupting platforms like Facebook by limiting their ability to track users across apps. This change hindered Meta's ability to measure the return on ad spend with the same precision, as deterministic measurement of ad conversion rates was no longer possible.\nConsequently, Meta was forced to pivot to a probabilistic model, necessitating billions of dollars in investment, particularly in GPUs, to develop a machine learning algorithm for estimating ad conversion rates. This substantial investment strengthened Meta's competitive moat, positioning it and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) far ahead of competitors in terms of measurement and targeting capabilities.\nThese early AI investments not only helped Meta navigate the post-ATT landscape, but also enhanced its self-sufficiency amid broader industry transformations. The company's extensive reach across its diverse Family of Appsspanning text, image and video formatscontinues to benefit from these strategic advancements.\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\nMeta is well-positioned to capitalize on tighter integration of its technology stack thanks to its robust ecosystem and strategic partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company's customized chip projects have yielded successful outcomes, such as the launch of MTIA 2. This updated Meta Training and Inference Accelerator is specifically optimized for the company's recommendation algorithms, further strengthening its competitive advantage against smaller digital advertising peers in the generative AI era.\nThe company's first-quarter earnings commentary highlights the success of its engagement efforts, particularly in Instagram Reels, which now accounts for 50% of the time spent within the app. The significant investments in artificial intelligence have primarily focused on the Family of Apps, enhancing ad efficiency. Higher return on investment for advertisers on platforms like Facebook and Instagram encourages continued ad placements, driving Meta's growth trajectory.\nMeta's growth is propelled not only by increased AI investments driving total ad impressions, but also by robust AI monetization across its Family of Apps. For instance, Threads has reached over 175 million monthly users and is now focusing on ad monetization. Additionally, the company introduced an updated version of Meta AI powered by the latest model, Llama 3, which enhances user engagement by helping users explore topics of interest more effectively. Recognized as one of the leading AI assistants globally, this model lays the foundation for developing a wide array of new applications. Leveraging its vast social networking data, Meta can generate significant AI returns through various new models, including targeted advertising, which could substantially boost its advertisement revenue.\nMeta Platforms has demonstrated a solid track record in earnings over the past several years. Despite occasional misses on earnings per share, largely due to challenges in its virtual reality ventures and an advertising slowdown, the company has consistently surpassed analyst estimates for top-line results. Revenue has reaccelerated after a slowdown in 2022, propelling its trailing 12-month results to all-time highs for both revenue and net income.\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\nIn its first-quarter results, which were released on April 24, Meta reported earnings of $4.71 per share, beating analysts' estimates by 39 cents. Revenue for the quarter stood at $36.50 billion, up 27.30% year over year and surpassing estimates by $240 million. This robust performance was driven by several key factors:\nGrowth in daily active users, which rose 7% year over year to 3.20 billion in the first quarter, boosting engagement and yielding a 20% increase in ad impressions.\nIncreased advertiser spending led to a 6% boost in the average price per ad.\nSignificant investments in AI improved ad targeting and measurement tools, driving top-line growth.\nAverage revenue per person saw an 18% year-over-year increase, highlighting Meta's effectiveness in monetizing its extensive user base and generating more revenue per user. This achievement is particularly noteworthy given the challenging economic backdrop affecting many businesses. Looking ahead, the company is focused on monetizing engagement by leveraging AI-driven features across its Family of Apps, significantly enhancing monetization efficiency.\nMeta's disciplined cost management has been crucial in improving its operating efficiency and profitability. In the first quarter, the company's total costs grew by just 5.70% to $22.60 billion. This prudent cost management expanded the company's net profit margin by 1,400 basis points to 33.90%, enabling diluted earnings per share growth to far outpace revenue growth.\nIn 2022, the company increased its capital expenditure by 68% to build up AI infrastructure amid the generative AI boom, which impacted its free cash flow, leading to a 50% year-over-year decline. The stock subsequently dropped nearly 73%, from $331 to $91, in less than 11 months. However, a strong ROI from these investments boosted the company's fundamentals, as reflected in the 2023 earnings results. Now, Meta is entering another capex cycle to strengthen its AI research and development.\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\nMeta has been heavily investing in artificial intelligence, a trend likely to continue as the company optimizes and implements AI across its platforms. The company now anticipates 2024 capex to be between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from the previous range of $30 billion to $37 billion. Despite the substantial capex, I do not foresee a significant headwind in free cash flow as Meta's recent AI initiatives suggest a keen focus on quickly monetizing its projects.\nBased on the company's strong ROI track record, I believe these AI investments will generate substantial returns in 2025. Enhancements in both engagement and ad performance should translate into continued revenue and earnings growth, reinforcing the Meta's position as a leader in the social media and digital advertising landscape.\nDespite the stock's significant year-to-date performance, Meta currently trades with a forward price-earnings ratio of 18.40 based on projected earnings for 2024. This is notably lower than the Magnificent 7 average of 29.40. The multiple aligns closely with Alphabet's forward earnings ratio of 18.10, both of which are considered undervalued relative to their peers.\nIt is common for companies of this caliber to trade at 25 to 30 earnings, particularly in an environment where interest rates are expected to decline. Such a decline could prompt investors to rotate out of fixed-rate investments and back into the stock market, potentially boosting Meta's valuation.\nSource: Alpha Spread\nIn comparison, both Alphabet and Meta trade below Apple's forward price-earnings ratio of 28.40 and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) forward multiple of 29. Given this context, I believe the stock still has substantial upside potential. Meta currently ranks as the second least expensive stock among the Magnificent Seven based on forward price-earnings, trailing only Alphabet. If the stock returns to the peer average multiple of more than 28 times earnings, it could see a significant price increase. This implies a strong potential to reach a price target of $610 by the end of the year.\nUsing a discounted cash flow valuation approach, with a 7.75% discount rate reflecting Meta's capital structure and risk profile and assuming a 3% terminal growth rate beyond the initial five years, we can estimate the stock's intrinsic value. This terminal growth rate accounts for Meta's anticipated strength in the near to medium term, driven by emerging opportunities in AI and digital advertising. The DCF model yields a target value of $659.44, indicating an upside potential of approximately 24%.\nBoth valuation methodspeer comparison and DCF analysissuggest substantial upside for Meta. I remain confident that the company is well-positioned to capitalize on this potential, underpinned by its leadership in digital advertising and growing AI opportunities. This positions Meta as a compelling buy, offering strong upside prospects in the current market environment.\nMeta Platforms has demonstrated impressive growth and resilience, leveraging AI integration and strategic investments to enhance user engagement and advertising revenue. Despite a significant rise in value year to date, the stock remains relatively undervalued compared to its peers in the Magnificent Seven. With strong fundamentals, robust AI-driven growth and prudent cost management, the company is well-positioned for continued expansion and substantial upside potential, making it a compelling buy in the current market environment.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of Billionaire Phillipe Laffont\u2019s Top 10 \u201cMostly AI\u201d Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Philippe Laffont's other stock picks.\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont is a Founder & Portfolio Manager at Coatue Management, L.L.C. His fund\u2019s top 10 holdings comprise of mostly tech stocks which depicts his love for technology. His thirst for technology was such that after graduating from MIT with a computer science degree he applied for a job at Apple multiple times but was rejected every time. This pushed him towards another calling, which was to manage a hedge fund and its holdings.\nPhilippe Laffont\u2019s journey towards investing started when he moved to Spain where he started working at McKinsey. It was at this time when he learned about the \u201cboom of the PC\u201d and about the three pioneers of PC industry namely IBM, Dell and Microsoft. He decided to invest in these stocks which churned out more money than he was earning at that time. This led to his endeavors as an investor. In order to learn more about being an investor he got a chance to work at a mutual fund without pay where he learned about different terminologies related to the industry to \u201cget his foot in the door\u201d.\nAfter his employment ended in Julian Robertson\u2019s organization, he moved on to gather funds to start investing from his friends and family but most of his funds came from professional brokers and people who admired his entrepreneurial spirit. This led to the launch of his company on January 1, 2000, with $50 million at its disposal and the fund's AUM now stands at $50 billion. His investment philosophy is to provide longevity and good returns for the investors; and to have investors that would bet on him for the long term. Philippe Laffont\u2019s philosophy of helping out people is visible in his efforts to advise people on investing and he believes in helping any new tech \u201ckid\u201d that could become the next Tiktok.\nIn his interview at the Bloomberg Invest Philippe Laffont said that he is conflicted about whether small or big companies will be the AI winners. According to him the history of technology indicates that the big gets bigger but new companies have also made it through like Facebook or TikTok. He thinks that AI isn't overhyped and the valuations aren't out of whack right now. Here is what he said:\n\"It's true that the mentions of AI in every TV and and written form is very high. And so one could say, Wow, if everybody talks about it, it must be priced in. And the only reason why more positive is I remember when I invested in Apple in 2009 when the iPhone first came out and for years people told me, Why are you invested in Apple? Everybody talks about Apple. And obviously it had an incredible run. So I actually think that sometimes because someone speaks a lot about something, it might be actually a good sign versus an overhyped sign.\"\nPhilippe Laffont thinks the next phase of AI will be real estate with data centers and especially utilities with power. Another phase of AI, according to Philippe Laffont would be robots with artificial brains called humanoids. The technology hedge fund manager also made the following prediction which has a huge implication for the semiconductor stocks:\n\"I've made a lot of mistakes, You know, betting on these new technologies like AR/VR turns out to be not so big. 3D printing turns out to be not so big. My estimate is $100 trillion was invested in today's dollar in the PC, CPU based infrastructure. All this is going to get ripped out to put $100 trillion or more in our GPU based infrastructure.\"\nOur Methodology\nStocks mentioned in this article were picked from the investment portfolio of Coatue Management at the end of the first quarter of 2024.

        "Author": "  Lawrence Nga, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's been a roller-coaster ride over the last few years for investors in Meta Platforms\u00a0(NASDAQ: META).\nJust two years ago, the stock was struggling -- it fell to a low not seen since 2016 -- as the company faced a series of issues, such as slower growth and growing losses in its metaverse division. Today, the stock trades close to its all-time high as the company's turnaround plan begins to bear fruit.\nBut for latecomers who missed the rally in the last 12 months, is now still a good time to buy the stock?\nInvestors were used to Meta reporting ever-growing revenue and profitability until the end of 2021. That quarter, operating profit fell 1% year over year.\nWhile the bulls were still optimistic about the company's prospects, Meta's performance in the next few quarters shattered their hope. Operating income fell 25%, 32%, 46%, and 49% in the next four quarters. The tech giant ended 2022 with 1% lower revenue and a disappointing 41% fall in net profit.\nMeta's management team, in responding to the poor performance, took a series of decisive moves to get the giant back into shape. These efforts included massive layoffs, cost optimization, and refocusing attention on critical areas such as advertising and artificial intelligence (AI). And the result was incredible.\nIn less than a year, revenue was back in growth mode (up 16% year over year), and net income improved 69% to the high achieved in 2021. On top of that, operational metrics improved across the board. For instance, daily active users grew 8% to 3.19 billion while monthly active users improved 6% to 3.98 billion.\nFor a company as large as Meta, its turnaround speed and outcome impressed even the bears. The only downside was that the tech giant continued to incur heavy losses -- around 26% of its operating profits from advertising -- on its metaverse division.\nThe bears doubtful of Meta's turnaround in 2023 would have been blown away by the giant's first-quarter result in 2024.\nRevenue came in at $36.4 billion, an incredible 27% growth rate, while net income more than doubled from $5.7 billion to $12.4 billion. Net income grew faster than revenue as Meta optimized its cost structure. For instance, head count fell 10% year over year to just under 70,000 in the first quarter.\nDaily active users reached a new high of 3.24 billion, up 7% year over year. Ad impressions and average price per ad grew by 20% and 6%, respectively. In other words, the tech giant is firing on all cylinders.\nMeta's solid financial performance means it is now better positioned to invest in artificial intelligence and the metaverse. For example, its guided capital expenditure for 2024 is $35 billion to 40 billion, up from the previous guidance of $30 billion to 37 billion, in order to invest in AI-related infrastructure. It also guided for its metaverse division losses to increase meaningfully compared to 2023.\nWhile Meta's huge investments might again raise investors' concerns, the good news is that the company is much better financially positioned to make those investments.\nWhen Meta's stock fell to its multiple-year low in 2022, it had a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.5 times. Then, investors were concerned whether the company was a value trap.\nToday, the stock trades at 28.7 times the P/E ratio, above its five-year average P/E ratio of 25.9 times. The pendulum has swung from pessimism to optimism.\nWhile early investors benefited from the share price appreciation -- thanks to higher stock valuation and higher profits -- late investors have to pay a hefty premium to own the stock.\nThere is nothing wrong with paying a premium for a stock, especially for a company that can sustain its solid performance. However, if the company fails to deliver according to investors' expectations, its premium valuation can quickly contract to reflect the new reality.\nMeta's recent turnaround has been remarkable, evidenced by solid growth in the top and bottom lines. While it continues to report heavy losses in the metaverse division, growing profitability puts it in an excellent position to do so.\nStill, the stock is not an obvious buy since its outperformance in the last 12 months means it trades at a rich valuation. While it might not be wise for existing investors to sell the stock (it's usually wise to hold on to a winning stock unless it's terribly overvalued), it's probably too risky for new investors to buy it today.\nIn short, the stock is a hold.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nAs soon as the latest softer-than-expected inflation data numbers were out, investors began to take profits from major tech stocks and pour money into small-cap companies amid hopes of rate cuts. However, some were quick to call the latest decline in tech stocks the end of the AI-fueled rally that has pushed stock valuations to eye-popping levels. But there are some Wall Street analysts who believe this is just a short-term trend and large tech and AI stocks have a lot of room to grow. Samantha McLemore, CIO of Patient Capital, said while talking to CNBC that the \u201cbull market continues and the path of least resistance is higher.\u201d\nThe analyst said that she has been in the market for a long time and investors have been worrying about the end of the bull market since 2009, while the S&P 500 has grown over 1000% (17% per year) since then.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see any end to the bull market.

In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion. \u00a0However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it\u2019ll bode well for the stock down the road.\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta\u2019s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc.

Munster, however, thinks AI spending is necessary for these companies to reap rewards in the future.

The company\u2019s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it\u2019s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year\u2019s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year\u2019s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot,\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Famous Analyst Says You Should Buy the Dip on These AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Meta's reality check: Inside the $45 billion cash burn at Reality Labs",
        "Author": " Yasmin Khorram    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Nearly $50 billion.\nIn just over four years, Meta (META)\u2019s Reality Labs division \u2014 focused mainly on its products in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the metaverse \u2014 has lost as much money as the market caps of Snap (SNAP) and Pinterest (PINS) combined.\nInsiders tell Yahoo Finance that the staggering cash burn is not the price of innovation, but rather the result of a \u201cchaotic\u201d culture that features frequent reorganizations and installation of top leaders without AR or VR expertise.\nWith Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg warning that operating losses in Reality Labs will only continue to \u201cincrease meaningfully,\u201d Yahoo Finance spoke to a dozen former high-level employees (mostly executives or managers across multiple segments including engineering, research, product management, hardware, content, and operating systems) who say the lack of a clear vision and mismanagement are largely to blame for Reality Labs' financial pitfalls.\nThe former employees Yahoo Finance spoke with left within the last three years, with the earliest departing in February of 2021 and the most recent ones this year. The majority left on their own because of what they called discord within Reality Labs, but some left due to structural layoffs.\nThey asked not to be named because of nondisclosure agreements and a fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities.\nMeta did not respond to Yahoo Finance\u2019s multiple requests for comment on this story.\nThe question for investors is how to reconcile Reality Labs' multibillion-dollar expenses within the context of Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d promise for Meta. Despite implementing cost-cutting measures and scaling back spending in Q1 of 2023, Meta saw its shares tank 20% after its most recent earnings report, thanks to a significant increase in AI investment.\nWith Zuckerberg back to breaking open the checkbook, is there enough room on the balance sheet for his AI pivot and Reality Labs' steep losses? Although analysts and investors have remained patient on the long-term potential of AR and VR, how long is that leash more than 10 years on?\nBack in 2014, Meta (then Facebook) made its two largest acquisitions ever in just over a month. The first was its $16 billion purchase of WhatsApp. The second was of a smaller outfit out of Irvine, Calif., that had only developed a prototype of its revolutionary VR headset. The company\u2019s name was Oculus and the promise of its technology was enough for Mark Zuckerberg to shell out $2 billion \u2014 only a fraction of what he\u2019d spend on its development over the next decade.\nIn its first few years under the Facebook umbrella, Oculus's financials were grouped in with every other product in the business. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, Zuckerberg became enamored with the potential of the Metaverse \u2014 so much so that he changed the name of his company from Facebook to Meta.\nMeta also began breaking out its revenue and expenses into two separate divisions: \u201cFamily of Apps\u201d (which included Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), and \u201cReality Labs\u201d (a combination of Oculus and its other mixed-reality investments). In 2020, the former reported a profit of more than $39 billion, while Reality Labs lost just over $6 billion.\nThe numbers only became worse for Meta over the ensuing years: a $10 billion loss in 2021, $13 billion in 2022, and $16 billion in 2023. Furthermore, slumping sales and poor mainstream adoption caused Reality Labs\u2019 revenue to decrease annually. Since 2021, Reality Labs' annual revenue has been falling despite significant increases in spend.\nIn just the first quarter of 2024, Meta has reported a loss of $3.8 billion, about equal to its total revenues in the last two years combined. Analysts Yahoo Finance surveyed projected Q2 losses for the division would be closer to $5 billion. The lowest forecast we received was $4.6 billion.\nSeveral of the people interviewed blamed the dysfunction and cash burn at Reality Labs on chain of command reorganizations they say took place every three to six months. This included the promotion of \u201clocal heroes\u201d \u2014 or individuals that had succeeded elsewhere within Meta, such as Instagram or Facebook \u2014 who were then asked to replicate those results inside of Reality Labs. The lack of understanding of the technology often led to tension between new managers and the existing staff.\n\u201cIt was pretty chaotic,\u201d said a former employee who worked on the research team and said leaders were often pulled from the apps division with little VR experience. \"In software you can get away with that because you make mistakes and change things all the time. In hardware, you\u2019re stuck with your mistakes for a long time.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a senior director, they forklift you into any position,\u201d said a former executive in engineering. \u201cYou can lead an organization, set priorities, take on anything from Instagram ads to AR software design. It creates this really weird dynamic where the people in the trenches doing the work don\u2019t have respect for the senior leaders and the senior leaders don\u2019t really speak the language of the technology they\u2019re building.\u201d\n\u201cThey play employee bingo,\u201d said another employee responsible for AR/VR content. \u201cThey move people into AR that don\u2019t really understand it. It\u2019s hardware and experience, not a news feed in your hand.\u201d\nOne former executive in product management told us, \u201cThere's an arrogance there that says, \u2018Look how much money I was accountable for making because of this role I played in Facebook\u2019s Family of Apps \u2014 therefore I can obviously be successful at this new thing.\u2019\"\n\"I think that\u2019s probably the real story as to why there\u2019s been so much money thrown at this thing with such limited success today,\u201d they said.\nJust last month, several senior managers and vice presidents were quietly let go from the company, according to two people familiar with the matter. Their positions at Reality Labs included head of AR glasses hardware, head of hardware partnerships, vice president of supply chain organization, vice president of technology engineering, and head of silicon partnerships.\nAnother challenge is the lack of traction AR and VR products have had in gaining a wider audience. Meta also competes in the segment with Snap, Tik Tok parent Bytedance, and now Apple (AAPL).\nCircana Research analyst Ben Arnold says total AR and VR device sales in the US were just over $1 billion last year \u2014 a year in which Meta\u2019s Reality Labs expenses alone topped $18 billion. According to IDC's analysis, global shipments of AR and VR headsets dropped 67.4% year over year in 2024 Q1.\nMeta\u2019s current product lineup includes two VR headsets (the Quest 3 and Quest Pro) and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. But Arnold says software gains will be critical to the industry, specifically \u201cin content and applications that appeal to people beyond gamer.\"\n\"That\u2019s always been the challenge for this category,\u201d he said.\nA former employee said that at one point, there were 24 hardware products on an 18-month roadmap. \"You might be able to do that if you\u2019re shipping software experiences, but highly unlikely for an organization that has never really shipped outside of the Oculus space.\"\nThe source said management did not realize until too late that shipping \"a wrist [watch], sunglasses, new controller models, new VR experiences, new mixed-reality experiences\" was unrealistic, leading to low morale among the workforce.\n\u201cI had severe doubts about leadership,\u201d they said.\nEmblematic of that lack of direction was the scrapped development of Meta\u2019s in-house chips for its Ray-Ban smart glasses and other devices. In 2021, after over a year of design and build, Meta\u2019s vice president of AR Alex Himel abruptly canceled the project, instead returning to using an external Qualcomm (QCOM) chip.\nThe team was incensed. \u201cAll of us in the room that were software and chip people were like, \u2018You\u2019re insane,\u2019\u201d said a former executive who was directly involved in the project. \u201cPeople were livid over this. People left the company. This guy basically flushed millions of dollars down the toilet.\u201d\nThe cost of the internal chip was cheaper than Qualcomm's chip, according to another executive involved. \"It's illustrative of this mindset of not really taking the innovation piece seriously and not wanting to invest in long-term deep technology on the hardware side,\" they said. Himel did not respond to Yahoo Finance\u2019s request for comment.\nAnother executive put Meta\u2019s spontaneous decision making more succinctly: \u201cI had anti-confidence in the roadmap. Zuck gets excited. Everyone rallies around what Zuck gets excited about. Boz [Reality Labs head Andrew Bosworth] gets a budget based on Zuck\u2019s excitement, and then we go off and try to figure out what the product looks like. Over and over and over again.\u201d Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth did not respond to a request for an interview.\nAs for Zuckerberg's vision for his multibillion-dollar bet, sources say he sees the metaverse as another community he can own, similar to how he revolutionized social media with Facebook. \"He's really big on the notion of an immersive presence across boundaries,\" a former executive who worked closely with Zuckerberg said.\n\"When we were working on the Orion [AR] glasses, the top Zuck scenario was always immersive video calls. We did all the modeling on the heat and battery performance and we told him, 'Dude, we can do a call like this for five minutes and then the person's head catches on fire.' It's a power-hungry thing, but it's one of those goals he's chasing.\"\nAnother former executive said Zuckerberg is at the mercy of Apple \u2014 due to its anti-data-tracking efforts and Vision Pro development \u2014 so he's playing \"a big chess game.\"\n\"His bet is that the next thing after phones will be augmented reality glasses. Apple is making moves and he's trying to protect by investing in the future and hoping to own the next platform.\"\nWall Street, meanwhile, has its own mixed reality on the stock. Gene Munster, co-founder of Deepwater Asset Management, called Reality Labs \u201ca disaster from a financial perspective.\u201d Munster told Yahoo Finance that the stock would be higher if not for the significant cash burn inside the division.\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives agreed, referring to Reality Labs as the \u201cblack eye of spending at Meta.\u201d Yet, both remain bullish on the stock, despite Munster believing that Reality Labs won\u2019t play a real role in Meta\u2019s future for at least a decade.\nMeta investor Dan Niles of Niles Investment Management called Reality Labs \u201ca giant insurance policy,\u201d saying Meta could always cut spending in the division if its other businesses falter.\nFor those insiders with \u201cReality Labs\u201d on their resumes, it\u2019s a different conclusion. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem responsible,\u201d said a former executive. \u201cIf I was a shareholder, I would rather see Zuckerberg putting all their metaverse infrastructure on top of somebody else burning at those rates. Let Samsung or Apple build that hardware.\u201d\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

        "Author": "  Radek Strnad ",
        "Text": "Shares of social network operator Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) jumped 9.9% in the morning session after the company reported second quarter earnings results. Meta slightly beat analysts' revenue guidance expectations for the next quarter. In addition, this quarter's revenue and EPS narrowly outperformed Wall Street's estimates.\nLooking ahead, the company expects to continue investing in Reality Labs as its Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses are seeing strong traction. Overall, this quarter seemed fairly positive, and shareholders should feel optimistic. After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $496.63, up 4.7% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Meta? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nMeta's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 5 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago, when the stock gained 21.9% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, operating income, and EPS, all exceeding analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024, partly explaining why Meta had a strong quarter.\nLooking ahead, Meta's Q1 2024 revenue guidance topped Wall Street's forecast, while its anticipated full-year 2024 capital expenditures came in slightly higher. The company expects this capex growth to come from investments in servers, including AI and non-AI hardware (you're welcome, Nvidia), and data centers as it ramps up construction for its new data center architecture. These investments will be key for its open-source large language model, Llama, to successfully compete against OpenAI's closed-source ChatGPT. Perhaps the most interesting part of the quarter was the announcement of a quarterly dividend - the first in the company's history. Overall, this was a really good quarter that should please shareholders.\nMeta is up 43.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $496.63 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $539.91 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Meta's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,575.\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n"

        "Title": "Meta Platforms (META) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Meta Platforms (META) reports results for the quarter ended June 2024. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 31, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis social media company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +45.2%.\nRevenues are expected to be $38.27 billion, up 19.6% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Meta Platforms?\nFor Meta Platforms, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.45%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Meta Platforms will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Meta Platforms would post earnings of $4.32 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.71, delivering a surprise of +9.03%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nMeta Platforms doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nAn Industry Player's Expected Results\nAmong the stocks in the Zacks Internet - Software industry, DoubleVerify Holdings (DV) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.04 per share for the quarter ended June 2024. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -42.9%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $153.62 million, up 14.9% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus EPS estimate for DoubleVerify has been revised 10.5% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.76%.\nThis Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that DoubleVerify will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Oliver Rodzianko ",
        "Text": "I have covered Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) many times before, and I've usually been bullish about the company. However, in this analysis, I think a neutral rating is more warranted because the valuation has become slightly overextended. The company's year of efficiency gains have certainly culminated by now and moving forward, growth is likely to moderate toward more traditional levels and then slow further.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META.\nThat being said, much of the near-term growth is already priced into the stock, which is made evident by the GF Value chart. However, I think long-term investors would be wise to continue holding Meta because it has recently issued a dividend, which I think is going to grow substantially over the next 10 years.\nMeta is making heavy investments in artificial intelligence and the Metaverse, and management has noted these two technologies are vital to the company's future growth. For instance, AI-driven content recommendations are boosting user interaction. Further, Meta has developed its own set of large language models. Based on this, I think it will become one of the leaders in information-based AI.\nIn line with its Metaverse ambitions, management has also directed the company toward virtual reality and augmented reality through its Reality Labs division. It has recently partnered with Rayban to release smart glasses, and it has a long-term vision to create a fully immersive Metaverse by 2030. If successful, the company could be pivotal in revolutionizing social interaction, remote work opportunities, education and entertainment, among other use cases.\nMoving forward, the company will also be actively working on expanding its presence in emerging markets as internet adoption rates in less-developed regions grow exponentially. Management has structured an initiative called the Facebook Connectivity project, which aims to provide affordable internet access in underserved regions. This strategy is vital to help Meta tap into new user bases and will help it continue to sustain growth.\nMeta recently initiated its first-ever dividend. It announced a cash dividend of 50 cents per share for both Class A and Class B common stock, which will be paid quarterly and began in March 2024. While the yield is only a modest 0.20% right now, this marks the start of an exciting new chapter for its shareholders.\nAs its payout ratio for the dividend is reasonably low, many analysts suggest management will increase the dividend payments in the future. I think this is going to attract a new market of investors, and while future growth might not be as bright as it once was during the company's ascent, the prudent and gradual shift of financial strategy to favor income investors bodes very well for the stock's long-term popularity.\nHowever, the revenue growth and net income growth slowdown are likely to create some price volatility in the interim, especially as higher dividend yields are not likely to be initiated anytime soon. Currently, the share price is showing resistance, which, based on my experience, is reflective of the slower future fundamental growth estimates being priced in by the market.\nMeta has achieved 116% earnings per share without non-recurring items growth and 23% revenue growth over the past year, but the future three-year consensus analyst estimate is a 21% earnings per share without NRI growth rate and a 14% revenue growth rate, indicating the significant slowdown already being represented in the price. I think this is going to produce downside volatility based on the overvaluation indicated by the GF Value Line.\nIn other words, I think now is a poor time to invest in Meta. In addition, those who are not tolerant of some short-term downside may consider selling at the present levels and reallocating the capital to an undervalued stock. In effect, this strategy would be likely to deliver the highest alpha overall.\nThat being said, if one is keen to stay invested in Meta, long-term growth should be good despite any short-term downside from overvaluation and the dividend is a valid reason to stay invested over the next five to 10 years.\nAs a technology researcher, one of the elements about Meta that has come to my attention from listening to and reading the work of many Silicon Valley executives and experts from further afield is the company is developing somewhat of a bad reputation for the effects its products are having on people's health. For example, research indicates the platforms can decrease social cohesion rather than increase it and also negatively impact brain health by having detrimental effects on dopamine production related to notifications. This is a problem I think is going to be brought to light more in the coming years, and I think if Meta does not work to address this issue more proactively, it could see a reduction in user engagement and experience fundamental contraction as a result.\nThat being said, Meta is working hard to try to address these issues and I have heard Mark Zuckerberg express his acknowledgments of these concerns myself. The company is investing in research to adapt its models to be safer and healthier. As an example of its proactivity, it has enabled parental controls in the form of 30 tools to help protect teens and give parents oversight over their children's use of Meta's services.\nIn addition, as Meta is becoming more aggressively focused on AI now, it is important to recognize how competitive this field is becoming. Other players, like OpenAI, Grok, Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and others, are likely to pose a threat to Meta's market share. What I think Meta has going for it is that it has embedded its AI into its family of apps, which is a significant point of access. Further, unlike Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta has developed its own AI infrastructure and models, meaning it isn't reliant on other major players like OpenAI for its capabilities. This opens up much more room for profit generation over the long term.\nI am very confident in Meta's long-term future despite the growing concerns related to health, which I think the company will address more proactively moving forward. I think as the company evolves it will become a lot more immersive, and the result of this should translate to retention of user engagement over time. As the community becomes fully formed and the market is fully saturated, Meta's financial approach to offering dividends is very shrewd, and I think it has the potential to keep investors very pleased if it expands this dividend substantially in relativity to the slowing fundamental growth rates.\nMeta is capable of evolving into a company that, over the long term, is seen as a net benefit to society rather than an issue to public health. While it has a history of bad press related to the negative effects of its apps, particularly on young people, the company's moat is now much wider, so it has to compete less aggressively. Instead, its work is in maintaining its ecosystem. From listening to many interviews with Zuckerberg, I think he is going to focus on the reputational value of Meta rather than the pure monetization of its platforms and hours of user engagement. This could open up new revenue streams and be more conducive to long-term growth and sustenance than focusing on short-term earnings results.\nThis potential approach to ecosystem reputation, along with the dividend in the financial strategy, makes me very confident in the company's long-term future potential, despite the short-term volatility I see as likely in the stock price over the next 12 months due to its potential overvaluation.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "As Meta Platforms spends tens of billions of dollars to develop AI, the company\u2019s core apps business is booming. The tech giant reported that its fiscal second quarter net income soared by 73% to $13.47 billion on revenues $39.07 billion, both of which beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates. Meta\u2019s stock price rose 7% in after-market trading.\nHere are the top-line results:\nRevenues:\u00a0$39.07 billion, up 22% from $32 billion in 2023. Analysts from Zack\u2019s Investment Research estimated revenue of $38.34 billion.\nNet income:\u00a0$13.47 billion, an increase of 73% compared to $7.8 the year prior. Meta\u2019s diluted earnings per share of $5.16 beat Zack\u2019s estimate EPS of $4.70.\nDaily active users:\u00a03.27 billion on average for June, up 7% year-over-year\nMeta is part of Big Tech\u2019s AI arms race and is ramping up investment in generative AI and AI-related product development to keep pace with rivals Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple, along with Microsoft-backed OpenAI.\nBut Wednesday\u2019s results were rooted in success in Meta\u2019s core advertising and Family of Apps business, which includes Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Threads. Family of Apps reported income from operations of $19.35 billion, up 47% from the year-ago quarter, on revenue of $38.72 billion, which rose 22%.\nFounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that messaging platform WhatsApp now serves more than 100 million monthly active users in the United States and that one-year-old Threads is nearing 200 million monthly active users. He also noted that Facebook is growing among younger adults, which he said \u201creally [goes] against the public narrative around who\u2019s using the app.\u201d\nAt the same time, Meta reported a 10% year-over-year increase in ad impressions delivered across the company\u2019s family of apps, with the average price per ad also growing 10% compared to 2023.\nThe results were offset by continued losses in Meta\u2019s Reality Labs business. But Zuckerberg was unbowed, promising to double down on both the metaverse and AI spaces.\n\u201cWe are in the fortunate position where the strong results that we\u2019re seeing in our core products and business give us the opportunity to make deep investments for the future, and I plan to fully seize that opportunity to build some amazing things that will pay off for our community and our investors for decades to come,\u201d Zuckerberg said during Wednesday\u2019s shareholder call. \u201cThe progress we\u2019re making on both the foundational technology and product experiences suggests that we\u2019re on the right track.\u201d\nZuckerberg touted the success of Meta AI, which he said is \u201con track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.\u201d the positive sales of Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses and the growth of one-year-old Threads, which the company said is nearing 200 million in monthly active users.\nMeta said it expects third quarter 2024 revenue to be in the range of $38.5-$41 billion. And Meta expanded its estimated full-year 2024 capital expenditures from $35-40 billion to $37-$40 billion.\n\u201cWe currently expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence research and product development efforts,\u201d the company said in its earnings statement.\nAfter a few years in which Zuckerberg has worked to slim down Meta\u2019s workforce, the headcount remained relatively stable this quarter, decreasing by 1% year-over-year.\nMeta warned Wednesday that Reality Labs will likely be an ongoing drain on earnings, with mounting losses due to product investment and development.\u00a0The unit recorded an operating loss of $4.48 billion on revenue of $353 million in the second quarter, a 20% dip from a loss of $3.74 billion on $276 million in revenue the year before.\nMeta has booked about $50 billion in cumulative losses from Reality Labs since 2020.\nThe Meta CEO nevertheless reiterated his message to Wall Street on Wednesday that the company has a track record of making long-term technology bets that pay off years later.\n\u201cWe have a relatively long business cycle of starting a new product, scaling it to something that reaches a billion people or more, and only then really focusing on monetizing at scale,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\nWhat is still unclear for Meta \u2013 and other Big Tech companies \u2013 is how long it will take for their AI investments to pay off.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re still uncovering the wide range of use cases that it\u2019s valuable for,\u201d Zuckerberg told analysts. \u201cAn important part of our vision is that we\u2019re not just creating a single AI, but enabling lots of people to create their own AIs.\u201d\nThe Meta CEO\u2019s enthusiasm for AI development was palpable on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s why there are all the jokes about how all the tech CEOs get on these earnings calls and just talk about AI the whole time,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s actually super exciting, and it\u2019s going to change all these different things over multiple time horizons.\u201d\nThe post Meta\u2019s Push Into AI Development Shows Promise With 73% Surge in Net Income appeared first on TheWrap.\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy Based on New AI ETF.\u00a0Since Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nOver the past few months the market has seen a massive influx of AI-related ETFs as investors look to ride the bandwagon of AI investing. A report from Wall Street Journal in June said that all ten AI ETFs tracked by website ETF.com saw inflows this year. One major AI ETF, launched by Roundhill, saw its assets grow to $35 million from under $1 million in just two weeks.\nAmid the craze of AI ETFs, does it make sense to start investing in every new ETF? Analysts offer some guidance. A Wall Street Journal report quoted Morningstar analyst Kenneth Lamont, who said that we should look for \u201cthematic purity\u201d while investing in AI ETFs. The ETF you choose, according to the analyst, must be investing in \u201cbellwether\u201d stocks positioned to benefit from the AI industry trends.\nThere is a new AI ETF in town. KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX), launched earlier this month, tracks the Solactive Etna Artificial General Intelligence Index, which captures the performance of AI tech companies. The index seeks exposure to three main AI categories: hardware, infrastructure, and applications. The index picks companies by assigning \u00a0AI Exposure Score, which assesses each company\u2019s relevance to AI tech. You can get exposure to AI companies focusing on data centers, LLMs, AI tech to reduce costs and improve customer experience.\nIn this article, we will discuss the top 10 holdings of this new AI ETF and see whether they have the potential to rise in the coming months and weeks. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) accounts for about 4.2% of the net assets of KraneShares Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AGIX).\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill chose Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) as one of his top AI picks in the consumer AI space.\nThe social media giant is using AI for optimizing ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion. \u00a0However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it\u2019ll bode well for the stock down the road.\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta\u2019s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc.

        "Author": "  Maleha Afzal ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stories.\nChina and the United States continue to compete against each other as the AI boom continues to reign in the tech industry. On July 2, Reuters reported that China plans to develop 50 new national and industrial standards for artificial intelligence by 2026. The country aims to standardize systems in the artificial intelligence sector by providing thorough guidelines to companies and budding startups. Furthermore, on July 3, Reuters reported that China filed six times more patents than the United States for inventions in AI like chatbots. On a global scale, more than 50,000 patent applications were filed in the past decade, a quarter of which were filed in 2023 alone. China filed 38,000 generative AI applications between 2014 and 2023, while the United States only filed slightly over 6,200 applications during the same period. Of the total applications, ByteDance, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft filed the largest number of applications. The report added that Chinese patent applications covered a wider range of sectors such as autonomous driving, publishing, and document management. South Korea, Japan, and India were ranked third, fourth, and fifth with the highest number of patent applications.\nThe United States, on the other hand, has reportedly accumulated $55.6 billion in venture capital funding in the second quarter of 2024, the highest quarterly total in two years. On July 3, Reuters reported that the surge in venture capital funding is driven by developments in artificial intelligence. Such is a 47% increase from the $37.8 billion raised by startups in the first quarter of 2024. Significant investments include $6 billion by Elon Musk's xAI and $1.1 billion raised by CoreWeave. Previously, venture capital funding took a hit, reporting $35.4 billion in the second quarter of 2023 amid high interest rates and sluggish economic growth. While venture capital and investment in AI are increasing, the IPO market remains sluggish.\nWhile the threat of Chinese innovations looms over the United States, startups in the country are disrupting the industry with key innovations. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is a leading artificial intelligence company based in the United States. In February this year, OpenAI closed a deal with venture capital firm Thrive Capital, allowing it to buy some of its shares in a tender offer, bringing its total valuation to $80 billion. This is a threefold increase in its value from a few months ago in 2023.\nOn June 10, OpenAI and Apple announced a partnership to integrate ChatGPT into iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. Users will now be able to access ChatGPT's capabilities on all these devices without having to switch tools. Siri will also be able to reach ChatGPT when a user asks a question and will present them with an answer directly from the chatbot. ChatGPT will be integrated into Apple's writing tools, allowing users to create content when required. The development ensures that user security remains intact. Requests are not stored by OpenAI and IP addresses remain obscured. Users may connect to their ChatGPT account, allowing them to choose their data preferences. The integration will be executed later this year and can be accessed for free without having to create an account.\nIn another update, Apple is reportedly positioned to join OpenAI's board. On July 2, Reuters reported that Apple is set to get an observer role on OpenAI's board, part of the agreement made by the two entities a month ago. Phill Schiller, head of Apple App Store and former marketing chief, was selected for this position. The board agreement will take effect later this year. As of yet, Schiller has not attended any meetings.\nAnthropic, OpenAI's direct competitor, is an artificial intelligence startup founded in 2021. The company is led by Dario and Daniela Amodei as CEO and president. The safety and research company is popular for its safety-oriented language models that produce reliable interpretable, and steerable AI systems. On March 27, CNBC reported that Amazon invested an additional $2.75 billion in the startup, bringing its total investment to $4 billion. Anthropic's valuation at that time was $18.4 billion and closed five different funding rounds worth $7.3 billion in the past year. Amazon will remain a minority stakeholder in the company. Last year, Alphabet's Google announced an investment worth $2 billion into Anthropic adding to its $550 million funding from earlier.\nClaude is the company's AI platform able to conduct advanced reasoning, vision analysis, code generation, and multilingual processing. Anthropic recently launched Claude 3.5 Sonner, its first release from the Claude 3.5 family. Claude 2.5 Sonnet has set a new benchmark for graduate-level reasoning, undergraduate-level knowledge, and coding proficiency. The new AI platform operates at twice the speed of Clause Opus. Based on an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was able to solve 64% of problems. On the contrary, Claude Opus was able to solve only 38% of problems. On July 2, Anthropic announced the launch of a new initiative for a robust third-party evaluation ecosystem. The new initiative will be able to fund evaluations developed by third-party organizations to measure advanced features in AI models. The company strongly believes that the initiative will enhance AI safety level assessments, improve safety metrics, and develop infrastructure and tools for evaluations. The safety level assessments will encompass cybersecurity, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, model autonomy, national security risks, and social manipulation.\nA lot is going on in the AI space and several companies have emerged as interesting AI stories. We have compiled a list of the most interesting AI stories on Wall Street by studying many reports and publications and watching interviews. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, which was sourced from Insider Monkey's proprietary database that tracks over 900 elite money managers.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 246\nMeta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) moves in AI contribute to its ranking as the third biggest AI story on our list. Meta AI, built on Llama 3, is one of the most advanced AI models developed by the company. Meta AI is capable of complex reasoning, problem-solving, and understanding instructions. Like Microsoft, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is also advancing its AI infrastructure capabilities. In April, the company introduced its next generation of custom chips to manage its AI workloads. The new chips will significantly enhance the company's recommendation ads model on Facebook and Instagram. 30% of posts on Facebook and 50% of content on Instagram are delivered by the company's AI recommendation system. The Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) v1 is the company's first inference accelerator designed in-house, capable of handling high-complexity and low-complexity ranking and recommendation models. The company expects expenditure on AI to expand. As per a recent update, the company looks forward to increasing its capital expenditure from $35 billion to $40 billion, driven by large investments in AI, in 2024.\nMeta's growth in producing responsible AI models can be attributed to its strong research capabilities. On June 18, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) launched new AI research models to boost innovation at a much larger scale than before. The company released five new models including image-to-text and text-to-music generation models, a prediction model, and a model that detects AI-generated speech. Meta Chameleon is a family of mixed-modal models capable of understanding, processing, and delivering both text and words at the same time. The AI can take any input of text and words to output any combination of text and words required. To replace standard text and idea generation, the company proposed a multi-token prediction approach that would make large language models significantly more efficient. This approach trains models to predict a variety of future words instantly, replacing the common one-at-a-time approach.\nJustin Patterson, Keybanc's managing director, recently talked about Meta's position in the market in an interview on Yahoo Finance. He raised his price target from $475 to $540 amid Meta's strong advertising growth. Patterson pointed out that Meta's ad revenue is increasing every quarter which is a reflection of strong demand and he is optimistic about returns from the AI advertising cycle. Overall, Patterson has noticed stronger engagement across all of Meta's platforms due to AI investments and improvements in its ad models.\nMETA was held by 246 hedge funds at the close of Q1 2024, with total stakes amounting to $46.92 billion. Of those, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was the highest stakeholder with a position of $7.07 billion.\nOn July 3, Loop Capital reiterated a buy rating on the stock and maintained its price target of $550. Based on price targets from 67 analysts, META's median price forecast of $530 represents an upside of almost 4% from its current price of $509.65.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the biggest AI stories right now.

        "Text": "Meta (META) shares soared more than 9% in early trading Thursday after the company reported better-than-expected second quarter earnings results Wednesday, and despite warning it expects to see \"significant\" capital expenditures growth in 2025.\n\"While we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint,\" CFO Susan Li said in a statement.\nAI spending is a key measure for Wall Street as investors anxiously await a return on Big Tech\u2019s investments in the technology. During its prior quarter, Li raised the company\u2019s full-year total expense estimate from between $94 billion and $99 billion to between $96 billion and $99 billion.\nFor the second quarter, Meta saw earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 on revenue of $39.07 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $4.74 on revenue of $38.3 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Meta recorded EPS of $2.98 on revenue of $31.9 billion during the same period last year.\nThe company\u2019s Family of Apps revenue, which includes revenue from Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, clocked in at $38.72 billion, higher than estimates of $37.7 billion. Meta saw revenue of $31.7 billion in the segment in Q2 last year.\nBeyond its advertising revenue, Wall Street is still trying to determine how much longer Meta will need to plow money into AI before it sees some kind of revenue payoff.\nLast week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta\u2019s latest open-source large language model (LLM) called Llama 3.1. What\u2019s more, the Facebook founder said the industry should focus on open-source AI rather than closed-source models like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\"Meta is well positioned to drive value with [generative AI] for advertisers, but let\u2019s be clear that it\u2019s a ways off, if ever, before CMOs will simply hand over the keys to an AI agent that will autonomously generate ad creative on their behalf,\" Forrester research director Mike Proulx said in a note following Meta's earnings.\n\"While [generative AI's] technical capabilities meaningfully mature at an accelerated pace, Meta cannot lose sight of the responsibility and importance of the human touch in the advertising process.\u201d\nMeta\u2019s Reality Labs segment, which includes its mixed reality hardware and software, saw revenue of $353 million in the quarter versus expectations of $376 million. That's better than the company reported in the same quarter last year, but the segment continues to hemorrhage cash.\nIn Q2, Meta reported that the segment lost some $4.49 billion, slightly below expectations of $4.53 billion. It lost $3.8 billion in Q1. The division has also been plagued by turnover and a lack of clear vision, adding to Reality Labs\u2019 troubles, Yahoo Finance\u2019s Yasmin Khorram reported.\nMeta\u2019s announcement also comes after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced on Tuesday that he secured a $1.4 billion settlement between the state and Meta over the company\u2019s alleged use of Texans\u2019 biometric data without their permission for its Tag Suggestions feature.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The company is inching closer to its yearly highs following the recent share price climb.

Today we will analyse the most recent data on Meta Platforms\u2019s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 14% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Meta Platforms today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $585.79, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Meta Platforms\u2019s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\nInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, the fund returned -0.11% (gross) and -0.31% (net) compared to 8.33% for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and 4.28% for the S&P 500 Index. Generative AI (GenAI) remains the dominant market narrative in the second quarter. The portfolio does not own NVIDIA or other Semiconductor companies that are presently benefitting from the demand for AI hardware.

However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company's \"year of efficiency,\" where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins.

        "Title": "Meta's AI Revolution Begins",
        "Author": "  Yiannis Zourmpanos ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) rapid expansion, the fastest since 2021, has been driven by aggressive monetization and deep artificial intelligence integration into its platforms, including Facebook and Instagram.\nIts AI-powered recommendations have significantly increased user engagement, with 30% of Facebook posts and 50% of Instagram stories utilizing these systems. This surge in AI use has also boosted ad revenue.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META.\nDespite the premium valuation, the company's strong performance underscores its position as an AI leader, signaling additional upside for the stock.\nMeta, which owns some of the most popular social networking apps, recorded year-over-year top-line growth of 27% for the first quarter, coming in at $36.46 billion and topping the Street's estimates of $36.14 billion.\nThe company achieved its fastest period of expansion since 2021 on the back of aggressive monetization in its suite of applications and deep integration of AI features into its leading platforms. For example, Facebook reported that 30% of the posts used a certain kind of AI-powered recommendation system. Similarly, AI ensures it keeps 50% of stories on Instagram parallel to users' requirements, enhancing engagement and promoting more advertising campaigns.\nThe overall revenue increase was less spectacular. Still, Meta's bottom line effectively doubled, with net income hitting $12.37 billion, or $4.71 a share, versus $5.71 billion, or $2.20 a share, in the prior period. This leap was driven by a 16% reduction in sales and marketing costs, lower restructuring expenses and decreased professional services and marketing use.\nAlthough Meta does not report daily and monthly active users for its individual platforms, the company had more than 3.24 billion daily active people across its family of apps, creating strong momentum in which it offers one of the few brand-safe environments where advertisers can spend money to effectively reach this massive user base.\nConsequently, the family average revenue per person declined by 9% quarter over quarter to $36.46 billion; still, the number suggests growth of 18% from the prior year. This describes how Meta monetizes its consumer base and generates revenue.\nAdditionally, the 20% increase in ad impressions was primarily driven by Asia-Pacific and the Rest of the World. However, most of this came from Asia-Pacific, where ad impressions grew 28% compared with 16% growth in North America and 20% growth globally. However, this marked a deceleration from the growth of 34% recorded in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, the company witnessed a 6% rise in the average price of ads.\nFinally, major Chinese e-tailersfor example, Temu and Sheinimmensely helped to accelerate ad impression in the Asia-Pacific region on Facebook for selling inexpensive products to American and European clients, accounting for approximately 10% of the company's total profit.\nFor the second quarter, Meta expects revenue in the range of $36.50 billion to $39 billion, offset by a 1% currency headwind. The company expects expenses between $96 billion and $99 billion, up slightly from the impacts of infrastructure and higher legal charges vis-a-vis prior guidance. Operating losses by Reality Labs are expected to balloon because of investments in the development of products and their scale.\nThe full-year 2024 capital expenditures guidance has been raised to $35 billion to $40 billion.\nThe company also remains vigilant regarding regulatory headwinds in the European Union and the U.S. It was a solid start for the year, with momentum through the Family of Apps and significant progress on AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to change the way people interact for years to come.\nAdditionally, generative AI is an inherent part of Meta's investment to create value in the long run. At least one significant player includes Meta, which boasts a vast AI team and robust computing infrastructure. The company has introduced a new model of generative AI technologies called Llama 3, which makes it an active assistant to create means for building new models. Therefore, such integrations of AI enhance targeted advertising, Meta's primary revenue source. AI will make the Facebook, Instagram and Reels interface very engaging to the user by basing personal content around user preferences.\nAccording to AI and tech expert Puneet Gogia, AI chat tools for businesses on WhatsApp saw a 40% increase in paid messaging, with potential for ad integration. Enhanced tracking tools like Event Measurement improved ad performance, increasing sales by 9.50% and trackable sales by 20%. Lastly, efficient investments in AI systems, public code sharing and AI chip development strengthened the company's financial stability, positioning it as an AI leader.\nCompetition in digital advertising has to be one of the most significant risks standing in the way of Meta Platforms achieving its desired growth rates. The company does not operate a monopoly in the lucrative field. Still, it faces stiff competition from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which invests heavily in artificial intelligence to strengthen targeted advertising on search and YouTube.\nAdditionally, deterioration in the growth prospects of the U.S. economy could also pose significant risks to Meta Platforms' lucrative advertising business. Given that the company generates 98% of its sales from advertising, any economic downturn could be followed by significant cuts in ad spending, which could spell trouble for the company's revenue base. Thus, the company has also warned that it continues to watch the EU and U.S. regulatory landscape, which could impact its business and financial results.\nAn over 41% rally year to date has left Meta Platforms trading at a forward price-earnings multiple of 25. Nevertheless, compared to its peers, the stock appears to be trading at a discount, going by the average price-earnings ratio of 31 for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100. Given the double-digit percentage growth in revenue and earnings, it is justifiable for the company to trade at a premium given the solid underlying fundamentals.\nThe company is also sitting on a boatload of cash. It ended the first quarter with $12.5 billion in free cash flow, allowing it to aggressively invest in high-growth initiatives, such as augmented and virtual reality devices, the metaverse and AI.\nBacked by a solid balance sheet, Meta Platforms has returned value to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. For starters, it repurchased $14.64 billion in shares in the first quarter, reducing its shares in circulation, which is expected to bolster earnings per share in the long run. The company also paid $1.27 billion in dividends for a dividend yield of 0.41%.\nMeta's direction has been explosive, rallying more than 58% over the past 12 months. The rally was backed by solid underlying fundamentals, including substantial user growth numbers in its family of apps, which drove revenue up 27% in the first quarter. The company is also seeing a better balance between ad impressions and price, which allows it to generate more revenue.\nThe company is becoming more efficient and attractive to advertisers by integrating AI tools to enhance advertising campaigns, which affirms its long-term growth prospects. Given the stock is trading at a discount, it remains a solid long-term play amid the AI frenzy, having reiterated its commitment to returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

Lip said that he\u2019s still bullish on tech stocks and a single event does not show a trend.

Lip noted that small-cap stocks, real estate stocks, among others, gained ground on the back of this trend.\nHowever, Lip has high expectations from the upcoming earnings reports from tech companies. He also said that July has been one of the strongest months for tech stocks. Lip, however, said that major tech companies cannot go on to post record gains and their returns are expected to \u201cfall in line with historical returns.\u201d\nLip thinks the economy is entering a \u201cGoldilocks scenario\u201d where growth is steady but not \u201chot enough\u201d to cause inflation. He reiterated his view that he expects strong earnings growth this year and in 2025, which could be a tailwind for stocks.\nAsked what would cause earnings growth of tech companies, Lip said a lot of that comes down to efficient management and strong cash piles these companies have. He also said \u201cslightly\u201d lower interest rates could also be a tailwind for the economy.\nSince Lip is bullish on tech stocks and believes major AI companies still have upside potential, we decided to take a look at the top names in his portfolio.

In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion. \u00a0However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it\u2019ll bode well for the stock down the road.\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta\u2019s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc.

During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal fourth quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings surpassing analyst estimates. The better-than- expected revenues were attributed to strong advertiser demand and Al-driven ad improvements. Moreover, the company materially raised its fiscal first quarter sales and earnings guidance above analysts\u2019 estimates, buoyed by continued strong advertiser demand trends and enhancements to Reels. Advantage+. Click-to-message, and Shop Ads. Further, management noted that ongoing investment in Al is enhancing user engagement and advertiser returns through improved targeting and measurement. Separately, Meta authorized a new share repurchase plan representing approximately 5% of its market capitalization and announced the initiation of its first dividend, implying an approximate 0.4% yield.\u201d\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Analyst Says These 10 AI Stocks Have More Upside Potential. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc.

When you have the losers, there are no profits, but when you own winners in your portfolio, you can see losses because people want to take some profits off the table, Cramer said.\nThe CNBC host said when top stocks go down, people holding those in their portfolios often end up thinking about whether they should also sell these stocks and if something has \u201cchanged.\u201d\n\u201cFrom what I can tell you, nothing has changed about the stocks we are going talk about tonight. But it is true that the stocks are a heck of a lot more expensive than they were one year ago.\u201d\nIn this program, we took a look at some top tech stocks that fell last week and explained the reasons they lost value according to Jim Cramer. We also discussed these companies\u2019 fundamentals and hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nCopyright: rvlsoft / 123RF Stock Photo\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\nJim Cramer in a latest program said Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) seemed \u201csolid\u201d but it\u2019s a \u201clittle unnerving\u201d for people to own a stock that is not much liked by the front runner in the presidential race.\n\u201cEven though Trump is rabidly anti-China, he\u2019s willing to support Tik Tok, a Chinese company, as a counter-balance to Mark Zuckerberg.\u201d\nCramer was referring to Trump\u2019s recent statement where he said he\u2019s \u201cfor TikTok.\u201d\nJefferies analyst Brent Thill chose Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) as one of his top AI picks in the consumer AI space.\nThe social media giant is using AI to optimize ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion. \u00a0However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it\u2019ll bode well for the stock down the road.\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta\u2019s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) operates the world\u2019s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users across its platform. The company generates revenue predominantly from advertising. which accounts for over 95% of its total revenue, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal fourth quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings surpassing analyst estimates. The better-than- expected revenues were attributed to strong advertiser demand and Al-driven ad improvements. Moreover, the company materially raised its fiscal first quarter sales and earnings guidance above analysts\u2019 estimates, buoyed by continued strong advertiser demand trends and enhancements to Reels. Advantage+. Click-to-message, and Shop Ads. Further, management noted that ongoing investment in Al is enhancing user engagement and advertiser returns through improved targeting and measurement.

        "Author": " Yasmin Khorram    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Meta (META)\u2019s Reality Labs is still bleeding cash.\nThe division, which focuses on the company\u2019s AR, VR, and metaverse initiatives, reported a loss of $4.48B in its Q2 earnings on Wednesday. Reality Labs revenue accounted for less than 1% of Meta\u2019s total revenue.\nOn Thursday, Meta stock shot up roughly 9% when market opened.\nThe numbers come after Yahoo Finance reported last week that the multibillion-dollar losses at Reality Labs are the result of a lack of a clear vision, frequent restructuring, and leaders who don\u2019t have AR and VR expertise.\nWe interviewed more than a dozen former Reality Labs employees who have been granted anonymity due to non-disclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. Since that report, more insiders have reached out to Yahoo Finance, confirming the details in the story and offering additional insight.\n\u201cA few years ago I would have predicted that holographic AR would be possible before smart AI but now it looks like those technologies will actually be ready in the opposite order,\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. \u201cWe\u2019re well positioned for that because of the Reality Labs investments we\u2019ve already made.\u201d\nLosses in the metaverse division have exploded in the last four years, even as Zuckerberg shifts his focus to AI. In 2020 Reality Labs lost over $6 billion. The unit sunk $10 billion in 2021, $13 billion in 2022 and $16 billion in 2023.\nIn June, Reality Labs laid off roughly 100 employees, according to two people familiar with the matter. The cuts included several vice presidents, managers, as well as dozens of employees in the research division and technology engineering teams. Insiders tell Yahoo Finance that several \u201cbig bets projects\u201d were also canceled.\n\u201cA software company is trying to get into hardware and doesn't know how to manage it,\u201d said a former manager in engineering. \u201cThey\u2019re getting ahead of themselves with product launches and work teams when they don't even know what the technology is yet.\u201d\nMeta\u2019s current hardware products on the market include its Quest 3 and Quest Pro headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses. In April it announced it would offer its operating system, Horizon, to external hardware companies.\nThe company has recently been teasing that its prototype augmented reality glasses is nearly ready to unveil. Referred to internally as \"Orion,\" Meta has thrown tens of billions of dollars at the nine-year-old project.\nHowever, some former employees who worked on the glasses question whether the company will ever release it to the public.\n\u201cI would expect pretty substantial losses per device on the glasses,\u201d a former engineer said. \u201cProbably closer to the $1,000 per unit range, but it depends on what they end up trying selling them for and what features they end up including. They don\u2019t even know if they\u2019ll ever make them to sell.\u201d\nIn 2021, the metaverse became a buzzword following Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement that his social media company, Facebook, would be renamed to Meta. Zuckerberg enthusiastically claimed that humanity would one day in the near future socialize, work, and play in a shared virtual world.\nHowever, recent data suggests the metaverse revolution may be dwindling. Research from consumer analytics firm, CivicScience, found that adoption and intent to purchase AR and VR headsets has plateaued this year.\nAccording to market intelligence firm, IDC Global, shipments of AR and VR headsets dropped some 67% year-over-year in Q1 2024. Meta\u2019s market share has plummeted as others like Apple (AAPL) entered the scene, falling from 62% in Q4 2023 to 37% in Q1 2024.\n\u201cWith AR and VR, Meta came up with a solution when there never really was a problem,\u201d said a former Reality Labs employee. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth the amount of investment they\u2019re putting into it. If they\u2019re smart they\u2019ll scale back to 10% the size of the operation they are now. Someone else can come up with the hardware and use Meta\u2019s Horizon OS. That will make Zuck happier - being part of the Metaverse.\u201d\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

        "Title": "Everyone Knows Meta Platforms Makes Money From Facebook and Instagram. But 1 Wall Street Research Firm Says 17% of the Company's Value Comes From Something Surprising.",
        "Author": "  Jon Quast, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Social media empire Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is valued at nearly $1.2 trillion. And according to a report from investment research firm Needham, about 17% of this value -- or $203 billion -- should be attributed to a part of the business that might surprise you.\nOf course, with platforms as big as Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp, Meta Platforms' investors can be forgiven for overlooking something somewhere. But it's surprising that Needham believes there's so much value in a part of the business that gets such little attention.\nTo be clear, Meta Platforms' platforms are truly massive. The company doesn't break down its users per platform anymore. But across its social platforms -- what management calls its \"Family of Apps\" -- it has 3.24 billion daily active people as of the first quarter of 2024. That's roughly 40% of the planet's population.\nMany parts of Meta Platforms are big and important -- this much is true. But this other value driver shouldn't be overlooked.\nNeedham's report takes a look at short-form video platforms, such as TikTok. And increasingly popular in the short-form video space is the Reels service from Meta Platforms. Reels provides short-form video options on both Facebook and Instagram and was management's answer to TikTok a few years ago. And it's worth over $200 billion now, according to the aforementioned research firm.\nHow could this service be so valuable? For context, investors need to remember that almost all of Meta Platforms' revenue comes from advertising. When it comes to growing this revenue source, there are things the company can do to improve the effectiveness, placement, and frequency of ads. But all of this is predicated on user engagement -- if people aren't on the platform in the first place, it's not generating ad revenue.\nAs it turns out, Reels is driving engagement for Meta Platforms. On the Q1 earnings call, management said that when its users get on the Facebook and Instagram platforms, they're watching video more than 60% of the time. There are multiple ways to watch videos on these platforms -- it's not just Reels. But management is clear that Reels is driving the growth in Meta's video consumption.\nThe big question for investors is whether Reels can keep driving engagement growth. And there is reason to believe that it can. In April, Meta Platforms updated its video engine so that everything it has is interconnected, providing the ability for more relevant video recommendations, in theory.\nMeta Platforms is also working to upgrade its capabilities in artificial intelligence (AI), which management hopes will also improve the recommendation engine. And if users get better video recommendations, perhaps they'll binge-watch content just a little bit longer, giving the company a chance at higher engagement and ad revenue.\nIt's truly staggering to think that Meta Platforms is approaching trailing-12-month revenue of $150 billion and still growing at more than a 20% annual rate. But that's exactly what's happening, as the chart below shows.\nConsidering over half of the company's user engagement is from video, investors should definitely monitor trends with Reels from Meta Platforms. It does seem that people are generally moving toward the consumption of these shorter-form videos, so the demand is there. And if the company can continue to improve its system to provide better recommendations, it could keep driving engagement and consequently continue achieving an above-average growth rate. Together with a robust monetization strategy, that would be good for investors.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Meta vs. Reddit: Which Is the Better Social Media Stock?",
        "Author": "  Robert Izquierdo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "What a year 2024 has been for the social media industry. TikTok faces a potential U.S. ban. Reddit (NYSE: RDDT) executed an initial public offering (IPO). Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) saw its stock price nearly double from a 52-week low of $274.38 last August to a high of $542.81 in July.\nMeta's performance illustrates social media stocks' potential to deliver spectacular returns. But given the stock's recent run-up, is it too late to invest in Meta? Perhaps Reddit is the better choice since its life as a public company is just getting started.\nLet's take a look at Meta and Reddit to answer these questions and help you assess which is the better long-term investment in the social media space.\nMeta's outsized share price gains were due to several factors. For starters, its revenue rose an outstanding 27% year over year to $36.5 billion. This helped the firm produce strong free cash flow (FCF)\u00a0of $12.5 billion, a substantial jump up from the prior year's $6.9 billion. Meta's FCF growth enabled it to initiate the first dividend in its history, which pays $0.50 per share on a quarterly basis.\nThe company also took steps last year to reduce costs, which helped it kick off 2024 with first-quarter net income of $12.4 billion, a 117% increase year over year. Thanks to a combination of cost cuts and revenue growth, Meta's earnings per share (EPS)\u00a0underwent an impressive upswing over the past few quarters.\nIn Q1, Meta's diluted EPS rose 114% year over year to $4.71. The company's stellar results were due to growth in its advertising business, which hit $35.6 billion in Q1 sales compared to $28.1 billion in 2023.\nBecause Meta's global digital advertising market share is second only to Alphabet, the social media titan is well-positioned to benefit from the tailwind of industry growth. Digital ad spending is projected to expand by double digits year over year in 2024 and over the next few years.\nLike Meta, Reddit delivered magnificent Q1 results in its initial earnings report after its IPO in March. Revenue hit $243 million, a 48% year-over-year increase. Its user growth enabled Reddit's strong Q1 sales performance. Although the social media giant was founded in 2005, it's still growing users at a healthy clip. The company achieved record consumer traffic of 82.7 million in Q1.\nReddit generates the bulk of its income from advertising. Digital ads represented $222.7 million of the firm's $243 million in Q1 sales. Its rising revenue helped Reddit reach Q1 FCF of $29.2 million, up from $3.7 million in the prior year. The company also achieved an excellent Q1 gross margin of 88.6%, an increase from 2023's 83.6%.\nHowever, despite its superb Q1 sales, Reddit isn't profitable. It suffered a net loss of $575.1 million in Q1, which is significantly larger than its $60.9 million net loss in 2023. This increase was due to the costs related to its IPO.\nThe incredible Q1 results delivered by Meta and Reddit make both social media stocks appealing investments. So, here are some other factors to consider.\nOne is valuation. Because Reddit isn't profitable, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio commonly used for stock valuation isn't applicable. So, let's compare each company's forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which uses sales forecasts in the calculation. Currently, Reddit's forward P/S ratio is higher, suggesting Meta is the better value.\nNow, here's what Wall Street analysts think. Regarding Meta stock, their current consensus is an overweight rating with a median share price target of $540. This indicates a belief that Meta stock can see additional gains, suggesting it's not too late to buy shares.\nIn fact, Meta expects its excellent Q1 performance to extend into the second quarter. The firm estimates Q2 revenue to reach at least $36.5 billion versus $32 billion in 2023. Meta's ongoing sales growth is another indicator that it's not too late to invest in its stock.\nWall Street's consensus rating for Reddit is also overweight, while the median price target is $65. This suggests that some Wall Street analysts are dubious about the upside potential for Reddit's stock, given its share price at the time of this writing.\nTaking into account these factors as well as the financial performance of both companies, the better long-term investment between these two social media stocks is Meta. And Meta's dividend adds to your total return as you hold on to shares over the long run.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Investments in artificial intelligence will account for a significant increase in Facebook parent company Meta's expenses in the coming year, but stronger-than-expected revenue from its advertising business was enough to reassure investors that its business is on the right track.\nMeta Platforms Inc. reported stronger-than-expected results for the second quarter on Wednesday, sending shares sharply higher in after-hours trading. While it didn't say how much it expects to spend on AI next year, the company made it clear it would be significant.\nThe prospect of soaring expenses can often spook investors, but analysts said Meta's latest results show it can afford it, at least for now.\n\u201cThe market\u2019s positive response to Meta\u2019s earnings report is a bellwether for AI stocks. If a company can show strong results from its core business, its investments in AI will be seen more positively. If the core business is showing any sign of weakness \u2014 as we saw last week with Alphabet\u2019s YouTube \u2014 then the stock may seem more risky,\u201d said Debra Aho Williamson founder and chief analyst at Sonata Insights.\nShe added that Meta stands out from other tech companies with AI ambitions because it already brings in a \u201cmassive amount\u201d of advertising revenue \u2014 rather than trying to build a new business from scratch.\n\u201cAnd unlike Google, which is grappling with making changes that will impact its core ad business, most of Meta\u2019s AI investments are either aimed at making advertising on its properties work better or at building new features that could eventually become revenue drivers,\u201d Williamson said.\nThe Menlo Park, California-based company earned $13.47 billion, or $5.16 per share, in the April-June period. That's up 73% from $7.8 billion, or $2.98 per share, in the same period a year earlier.\nRevenue rose 22% to $39.07 billion from $32 billion.\nAnalysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $4.72 per share on revenue of $38.26 billion, according to a poll by FactSet.\n\u201cWe had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,\u201d said CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. During a conference call with analysts, Zuckerberg said Meta is in a \u201dfortunate position\" where strong results give it the opportunity to invest in the future.\nThe number of daily active users for Meta's family of apps \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger \u2014 was 3.27 billion for June, an increase of 7% from a year earlier. The company no longer breaks out user figures for Facebook as it had in the past. The company did disclose recently that WhatsApp has reached more than 100 million monthly users in the U.S. and Zuckerberg said that Threads, Meta's X rival, is about to hit more than 200 million monthly users.\nMeta said it expects its third-quarter revenue to land in the range of $38.5 billion to $41 billion. Analysts are expecting $39.1 billion.\nThe company hasn't given guidance for 2025 yet \u2014 it said it will do so during its fourth-quarter earnings call \u2014 but it expects infrastructure costs to be a \u201csignificant driver of expense growth\u201d in the coming year. Like other big tech companies, Meta is investing heavily in building its artificial intelligence capacity, including in data centers, and expects \u201csignificant capital expenditures growth in 2025 as we invest to support our artificial intelligence research and product development efforts.\u201d\nMeta is in a good position to grow \u201cat a much faster pace than the competition in both the AI and ad spaces going forward,\u201d said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because Zuckerberg\u2019s company keeps showing signs that it is able to keep growing at the 20%+ per quarter level in a much more efficient way than other big tech peers, such as Alphabet and Microsoft, for example; which are not only struggling to keep revenue growth in the double digits, but also are progressively taking a bigger hit on the margins side,\u201d he added.\nMonteiro added that Meta's strategy of focusing its growth on younger users outside of the U.S. appears to be paying off, though the numbers \u201cwould have been even better\u201d were it not for its Reality Labs segment dragging revenue lower.\nMeta's stock rose $23.67, or 5%, to 498.50 in after-hours trading.\n"

        "Text": "Social media giant Meta Platforms META is set to release second-quarter fiscal 2024 results today after market close.\u00a0The stock has delivered flat returns over the past three months and has outperformed the industry\u2019s decline of 5.8%. An upside might be in the cards if Meta Platforms beats estimates on earnings. It saw positive earnings revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat (read: Should You Buy the Dip in \"Mag 7\" and Big Tech ETFs?).This has put the focus on ETFs \u2014 Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund XLC, Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF FCOM, Vanguard Communication Services ETF VOX, iShares Global Comm Services ETF IXP and First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund FDN \u2014 with a substantial allocation to this social media giant.\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of -1.45% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\u00a0Meta Platforms saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 30 days for the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 45.2%. Revenues are expected to increase 19.6%. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 13.3%, on average, in the last four quarters.Meta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.33 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. Of the 45 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 39 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 86.67% and 2.22% of all recommendations.\u00a0Based on short-term price targets offered by 40 analysts, the average price target for Meta Platforms comes to $542.73. The forecasts range from a low of $360.00 to a high of $630.00.META has a top Growth and Momentum Score of A and belongs to a top-ranked Zacks Industry (top 22%). At current levels, Meta's stock trades at 23.02X forward earnings, a discount to the Zacks Internet-Software industry average of 31.34X.\nInvestors will be closely watching the signs of whether the AI investment by Meta has started to pay off returns, especially after Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) failed to impress. Most analysts are positive about the strength of META\u2019s advertising sales (read: Tesla, Google Spark Sell-Off in Technology ETFs).Like its tech rivals, META is investing heavily in its AI future by rolling out open-source artificial intelligence. The company released its mostly free Llama 3.1 artificial intelligence model last week and said developers can use and modify its AI models free of charge. There has been a steady increase in AI-generated content on Facebook and Instagram, attracting advertisers and enhancing user engagement. The trend is expected to gather momentum going forward. Additionally, Meta is expected to get a lift from advertising surrounding this year\u2019s election as well as the Olympics.On the last earnings conference call, the world\u2019s largest social media platform guided revenues in the range of $36.5-$39 billion for the second quarter. It raised its capital expenditure guidance to $35-$40 billion for this year from the earlier projection of $30-$37 billion and expects to increase it next year as well. The company expects 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion compared with the prior outlook of $94-99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.\nCommunication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC) - Meta Platforms takes the top position at 21.1% share (see: all the Communication ETFs here).Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF (FCOM) - Meta Platforms occupies the top position at 23.5%.\u00a0Vanguard Communication Services ETF (VOX) - Meta Platform takes the top spot with a 23.5% share.iShares Global Comm Services ETF (IXP) - Meta Platforms is the top firm, accounting for 21% share.First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN) - Meta Platforms occupies the second position with 9.1% of the assets.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Capital expenditures of $8.47 billion were below LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of $9.51 billion.\nOperating income climbed 58%\u00a0to\u00a0$14.9 billion as operating margin expanded from last year\u2019s comparable quarter when it amounted to 29% to 38%.\nNet income jumped 73% to $13.47 billion\u00a0with earnings of $5.16 a share surpassing LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of $4.73 per share.\nMeta expects current quarter revenue in the range between\u00a0$38.5 billion and $41 billion.\nAI-related developments\nMeta AI, which rivals offerings from Microsoft-backed (NASDAQ: MSFT)\u00a0OpenAI and Alphabet-owned Google is stated to be on track to become the most used AI assistant by the end of the year.\u00a0But, monetizing this tool will take time.\nWith its AI offerings, Meta also aims to make its core business, advertising, more effective, using these tools to improve ad performance and the overall user experience.\nAfter recently unveiling its most capable open-source AI model yet,\u00a0Llama 3.1\u00a0\u00a0as part of its AI push, Zuckerberg revealed Meta is already working on Llama 4, which it ambitiously aims to become \"the most advanced in the industry next year.\" This speed of development emphasizes\u00a0\u00a0Meta\u2019s determination to ensure that its technology is on par with\u00a0\u00a0that of rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google.\nHeavy AI infrastructure spending to avoid being late.\nLike Google, Microsoft and other tech peers, Meta boosted spending to invest in AI infrastructure, raising concerns about whether these massive costs will pay off.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0Meta CFO Susan Li revealed Meta expects significant CapEx growth in 2025.\u00a0But Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shares the reasoning with Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, prefering to risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than risk being too late.\nMeta\u2019s financials continue to benefit from cost-cutting efforts that Meta kicked off in late 2022. But the highlight of the report was undoubtedly the AI spending spree.\u00a0Although Meta also needs to prove its ambitious AI visions are worth the investment, like Google, Meta is delivering when it comes revenue growth and earnings beats, which is undoutebtedly easing investor concerns.\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The company's share price was up 6.1% as of 12:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nMeta Platforms published its second-quarter results after the market closed on Wednesday and reported sales, earnings, and engagement figures that beat Wall Street's targets. The social media company formerly known as Facebook also issued some very encouraging guidance, and its stock has received a wave of price-target increases from analysts.\nMeta posted revenue of $39.07 billion and earnings per share of $5.16 in the second quarter. The company's results came in $760 million higher than the average analyst estimate and beat Wall Street's profit target by $0.40 per share.\nSales were up roughly 22% year over year in the quarter, and per-share profits were up 73%. Even better, the quarter's beats were powered by strengthening engagement and monetization trends that paint a very bullish picture for its ecosystem of services.\nMeta reported 3.27 billion average daily active users in the quarter across its platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The performance represented a roughly 7% year-over-year increase. Total ad impressions and average price per ad each increased 10% compared to the prior-year period.\nFor the third quarter, Meta is guiding for sales between $38.5 billion and $41 billion. Before the update, the average Wall Street target had called for the business to record sales of $39.1 billion in the period. The company's guidance also assumes a 2% currency headwind due to unfavorable exchange rates.\nIt also announced that it now expects its capital expenditures (capex) for the year to be between $37 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous target for capex between $35 billion and $40 billion. Along with comments made during Meta's conference call, the upward narrowing of the guidance range makes it clear that the company isn't taking its foot of the gas when it comes to investing in artificial intelligence.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has, despite a few missteps, been a roaring success as a company over the years. It continues to be quite the juggernaut on the stock market, too. It might be hard to believe now, but the company's IPO price was set at $38 per share when it went public in 2012; it now trades for nearly $480.\nEven across a 12-year stretch, that's quite the return. Yet there are more gains to be had in the proximate future, at least if we can believe one analyst's recent bullish take on the company.\nIn mid-July, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) Securities' Justin Post reiterated his buy recommendation on Meta stock. He also maintained his $550 per-share price target, implying 15% potential upside on the current level.\nPost felt compelled to write a fresh note on the company because of some scuttlebutt about one of its business units, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) division Reality Labs. According to a recent report in tech industry tracker The Information, Meta aims to reduce its spending on Reality Labs' hardware products by roughly 20%.\nOf this, the analyst wrote that given the \"somewhat limited industry traction for VR devices (balanced by new optimism on AR glasses), Meta's unprecedented investment in a new consumer platform that is still very early, and a shifting company focus toward artificial intelligence (AI), these potential cost cuts seem very logical to us.\"\nWhile it's never encouraging to hear whispers of reduced spending on a hot product or service, I feel Post is right -- VR/AR is pretty lukewarm these days.\nI think Meta management doesn't get enough credit for being as nimble and as adaptable as it's been over the years. It's admirable the company doesn't get stuck on any one technology. That goes double these days, as AI in particular can become quite the sticky offering for Meta's immense user base. This stock is absolutely a buy, in my view.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

In the first quarter of 2024, advertising revenues increased 26.8% year over year to $35.64 billion and accounted for 97.8% of revenues. At constant currency, advertising revenues increased 26% year over year.Meta Platforms\u2019 advertising revenues are expected to benefit from strong spending by advertisers as they leverage its growing AI prowess.\u00a0The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2024 advertising revenues is currently pegged at $37.51 billion, suggesting 19.1% year-over-year growth.\u00a0Meta Platforms\u2019 offerings \u2014 WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Facebook \u2014 currently reach more than three billion people daily. Its staggering reach and increasing ad impressions (up 20% year over year in the first quarter of 2024) make META one of the most important players in the digital ad sales market apart from Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL Google and YouTube.In its recently concluded second-quarter 2024, Google\u2019s advertising revenues rose 11.1% year over year to $64.62 billion. YouTube\u2019s advertising revenues improved 13% year over year to $8.7 billion.\u00a0META has been leveraging AI and machine learning to boost the potency of its social-media offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Threads. Effective usage of AI has been helping the company keep its users engaged.

Currently, 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by its AI recommendation system. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram.\u00a0META is now incorporating AI tools into WhatsApp to make businesses more customer-oriented. The rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) is transforming conversational messaging platforms like WhatsApp to perform conversational commerce, including transactions like ride-hailing and grocery purchases. The AI tools will enable businesses to help customers find new products.\u00a0Meta Platforms is leveraging AI to boost Facebook\u2019s appeal among young adults, a demography that prefers YouTube and Snap\u2019s Snapchat.Powered by cutting-edge AI, META is offering user-centric features, positioning Facebook as a platform that resonates with young adults. It has upgraded Reels and Feed ranking technologies, resulting in better content recommendations. A newly developed model architecture allows for efficient learning from large datasets, significantly improving the performance of Facebook Reels.However, monetization of these AI initiatives is expected to take considerable time. Meta Platforms now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. Hence, the growth prospects remain modest in the near term.Risk-averse investors should note that growing regulatory concerns don\u2019t bode well for META\u2019s prospects.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. investors will be hoping it can do a better job than Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. in convincing Wall Street that lofty spending on artificial intelligence will be worth it.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nSinger Akon\u2019s Multibillion-Dollar Futuristic City in Africa Gets Final Notice\nWhat a Beautiful Bus Stop Can Do\nValencia Follows Barcelona in Crackdown on Short-Term Rentals\nA Vast Wetland Park Seeks to Slake a Thirsty Megacity\nA Radical Fix for Britain\u2019s Housing Crisis: A New Offshore City\nWall Street is taking a more skeptical view of how much is being spent on AI by tech firms and when it will start to pay off in terms of improved growth and profitability. The Facebook parent already irked investors in April by hiking its spending forecast above estimates. Microsoft shares slid 1% on Wednesday after it reported slower growth in its cloud computing unit and said capital expenditures would increase again in the next fiscal year.\n\u201cThe key question is whether Meta takes capex up even more,\u201d said Denny Fish, who manages the $7.2 billion Janus Henderson Global Technology and Innovation Fund. \u201cThe demand environment is pretty good, revenue trends have been strong, and the valuation is still reasonable. However, it sold off last quarter, when things were pretty pristine except for capex, which shows you how much investors are concerned about this.\u201d\nMeta, which reports on Wednesday after the close, has already shown some growth uplift from AI as the technology helps improve ad targeting on its social media products. It\u2019s also adding new AI features to WhatsApp, including an AI assistant that can help businesses connect with customers, answer questions, and sell their goods and services via chat. Shares rose as much as 2.8% in intraday trading ahead of the report.\nBut investors may have less patience with Meta than other Big Tech names. The shares suffered two post-earnings blowups in 2022 as Meta stuck to its guns on its metaverse strategy, sinking billions of dollars into an unpopular virtual-reality vision. It turned that around in 2023 by proclaiming a year of efficiency marked by heavy cost cuts, and pleased Wall Street in January with a $50 billion buyback and its first-ever quarterly dividend.\nThe shares are up 31% this year, outperforming peers in part because of Meta\u2019s relatively cheap valuation. Meta trades at about 21 times projected profits, well below the Nasdaq 100\u2019s multiple of 25 times. Still, the stock has fallen recently amid a broader rotation out of the sector, and a misstep on spending could extend the selloff. Options data indicates an implied one-day move of about 8.8% \u2014 in either direction \u2014 after the results.\nAnalysts are expecting Meta to report $9.5 billion in capital expenditures this quarter, up around 50% from the year-ago period, while full-year capex is seen coming in at almost $38 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net earnings per share are expected to grow 59% this quarter, and revenue is forecast to rise about 20%.\nResults from other Magnificent Seven companies have highlighted the importance of capex numbers \u2014 and the need for firms to conclusively beat expectations. Alphabet shares dropped last week after the Google parent sunk more resources into AI, fueling higher spending than analysts expected.\nOf course, the focus of any spending may be as important as the amount. Bank of America analyst Justin Post wrote in a note that cost cuts in Meta\u2019s augmented reality and virtual reality initiatives could \u201cmaterially boost\u201d investor sentiment, even if the savings are redirected toward spending on AI.\n\u201cWhile investors have been constructive on AI investment spending and opportunity, we think there is little investor support for the magnitude of Reality Labs spending,\u201d Post wrote, referring to the business division that includes the metaverse.\nMeta\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged concerns about spending in a recent interview on the Bloomberg Originals series The Circuit with Emily Chang.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a meaningful chance that a lot of the companies are over-building now, and that you\u2019ll look back and you\u2019re like, \u2018oh, we maybe all spent some number of billions of dollars more than we had to,\u2019\u201d he said.

        "Text": "By Aditya Soni and Reshma Rockie George\n(Reuters) - Meta soared nearly 9% on Thursday after its rosy revenue growth signaled that strong digital-ad spending on its social media platforms can cover the cost of its AI investments.\nThe parent company of Facebook was on track to add about $120 billion to its market value of $1.204 trillion, after it topped second-quarter revenue expectations and forecast growth for the July-September period that was above Wall Street's estimates.\nIts results were another positive sign for the digital ad market after upbeat earnings from search giant Google pushed up shares of smaller rivals such as Snap and Reddit by 2.7% and 4.4%, respectively.\nThe Snapchat parent is scheduled to report earnings after market close on Thursday.\nAnalysts said the strong report gave Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg more time to prove that the billions of dollars the company was plowing into AI would pay off. Even though the company's costs jumped 7% in the second quarter, its strong revenue growth drove a 9-point rise in operating margin to 38%.\n\"Underneath a cloud of tougher comparisons, a tougher macro, and mixed peer commentary, Meta continues to look like the best place to deploy digital ad dollars on the planet,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said.\n\"2025 capex will certainly be much higher, though whether it outgrows revenue next year remains an open question. Core AI has great return on investment, generative AI should have great return on investment,\" he added.\nChief Financial Officer Susan Li said on Wednesday that Meta was reaping the fruits of a multi-year project to use AI to improve targeting, ranking and delivery systems for digital ads on its platforms.\nMeta expects capital expenditure between $37 billion and $40 billion in 2024. Its spending surge mirrors forecasts from fellow tech industry powerhouses that are investing heavily in AI to capitalize on the booming technology.\n\"GenAI will require significant infrastructure investments to train the next generation of large foundational models and Meta is getting ahead of a multi-year capacity ramp,\" J.P.Morgan analysts said.\nMeta's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio stands at 21.1, compared with Alphabet's 20.6 and Microsoft's 31, according to LSEG data. Analysts have a median price target of $550 on Meta's shares.\n(Additional reporting by Lucy Raitano in London and Siddarth S in Bengaluru; Editing by Amanda Cooper and Shounak Dasgupta)\n"

        "Text": "Analysts on Wall Street project that Meta Platforms (META) will announce quarterly earnings of $4.69 per share in its forthcoming report, representing an increase of 45.2% year over year. Revenues are projected to reach $38.27 billion, increasing 19.6% from the same quarter last year.\nOver the last 30 days, there has been an upward revision of 0.6% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter, leading to its current level. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.\nPrior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.\nWhile investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as indicators of quarterly business performance, exploring analysts' projections for specific key metrics can offer valuable insights.\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Meta Platforms metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Revenue- Reality Labs' will likely reach $411.04 million. The estimate points to a change of +48.9% from the year-ago quarter.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Revenue- Family of Apps (FoA)' will reach $37.83 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +19.3% year over year.\nAnalysts predict that the 'Revenue- Advertising' will reach $37.51 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +19.1% from the prior-year quarter.\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Other' should arrive at $332.31 million. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +47.7%.\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Advertising Revenue- US & Canada' will reach $16.89 billion. The estimate points to a change of +19.5% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Advertising Revenue- Asia-Pacific' at $7.55 billion. The estimate points to a change of +17.3% from the year-ago quarter.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Advertising Revenue- Rest of the World' reaching $4.52 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +23.5%.\nAnalysts expect 'Advertising Revenue- Europe' to come in at $8.78 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +20.8% from the prior-year quarter.\nAnalysts forecast 'Geographical Revenue by User- Rest of World' to reach $4.71 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +26%.\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Headcount' should come in at 70,803. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported 71,469 in the same quarter last year.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Family daily active people (DAP)' of $3.26 billion. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of $3.07 billion.\nThe consensus estimate for 'Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)' stands at $11.61. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $8.32 in the same quarter last year.View all Key Company Metrics for Meta Platforms here>>>Over the past month, shares of Meta Platforms have returned -12.7% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.2% change.

        "Text": "As the world\u2019s largest social media company, investors will be scoping Meta Platforms META\u00a0stock as big tech continues to headline this week\u2019s earnings lineup.\nLet\u2019s see if it's time to buy Meta\u2019s stock as its Q2 results approach after market hours on Wednesday, July, 31.\nMeta\u2019s Q2 Expectations\nWith the majority of its revenue derived from advertising, Meta\u2019s Q2 sales are thought to have increased 19% to $38.27 billion. Furthermore, Q2 EPS is projected to soar 45% to $4.69 versus $3.23 a share in the comparative quarter.\nThis comes as Omnicom Group OMC, the largest advertising agency in the US was able to exceed top and bottom line expectations earlier in the month.\nNotably, Meta has surpassed earnings expectations for six consecutive quarters posting an average EPS surprise of 13.3% in its last four quarterly reports.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta AI & Metaverse\nAs ad spending continues to recover since the pandemic Wall Street will also be looking for updates on the contributions and outlook of META AI, an intelligent AI assistant offered across Meta\u2019s apps including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\nSocial media peers such as Snapchat SNAP\u00a0and Pinterest PINS\u00a0have also expanded their services with AI assistants but Meta has stood out in its quest to expand into the metaverse. Like Wall Street, investors have had mixed opinions in regards to Meta\u2019s spending on virtual and augmented reality to build out the metaverse with the company appeasing shareholders when it cut back on doing so.\nYTD Performance \nMeta\u2019s stock has soared +27% year to date which has impressively topped many of its \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d peers and the broader indexes while largely outperforming Snap\u2019s -26% and Pinterest's -14%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMonitoring Meta\u2019s Valuation\nAfter recently pulling back below $500 a share, META trades at 23X forward earnings which is on par with the S&P 500. It\u2019s also noteworthy that META trades pleasantly below its decade-long high of 74.5X forward earnings and at a slight discount to the median of 25.1X during this period.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nAfter such a sharp YTD rally, Meta Platforms stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Despite META trading at what has become a very reasonable valuation, the ability to reach or exceed Q2 expectations and offer positive guidance will be crucial to more upside. \u00a0\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to Instagram on Tuesday to call out the tech industry, saying it should focus its generative AI efforts on open models rather than closed ones like those developed by OpenAI, Google, and others.\nIn a blog post on the topic, Zuckerberg said open-source AI models would ultimately prove more secure and efficient as developers and researchers around the world fine-tuned them over time.\nTech giants are currently in a battle over whether closed-source or open-source AI models should be the path forward for AI. Closed-source models are, generally, those that are only available to a company's customers and limit how much they can be manipulated at a base level, if at all.\nOpen-source AI models are available to any interested researchers or developers who can manipulate the models' code. Think something like the difference between Apple's (AAPL) iOS operating system, which is closed, and Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Android, which is open.\n\"Open source will ensure that more people around the world have access to the benefits and opportunities of AI, that power isn\u2019t concentrated in the hands of a small number of companies, and that the technology can be deployed more evenly and safely across society,\" Zuckerberg wrote in his post.\nIn calling for the industry to rally around open-source AI, Zuckerberg is also rolling out the latest version of Meta's open-source Llama AI model, Llama 3.1, which the CEO says is among the most advanced in the industry. What's more, he says he anticipates the model will become the most advanced beginning next year.\nZuckerberg's Meta is going up against some of the biggest names in AI, including OpenAI and Google. Both companies offer their flagship AI models as closed-source software options, though they provide open-source models as well.\nZuckerberg says that making flagship AI models open source will improve security and overall capabilities, since a larger number of researchers and developers will be able to examine them from a base level, allowing them to catch flaws over time.\nThere are also concerns that open-source models will give the US's rivals, including China, easy access to high-powered AI technologies. But Zuckerberg claims that the US's adversaries could simply steal the code related to closed models and gain access to them that way. Closed models, he says, would also limit availability of AI technology to a small group of powerful companies.\nZuckerberg writes that leading companies should work with the government to help ensure they can take advantage of open-source AI models, ensuring they have a lead over other countries' governments.\nPart of Zuckerberg's emphasis on open-source technology has to do with his distaste for Apple's iOS and the iPhone maker's ability to control how Meta updates its apps. Meta also offers its own open-source programming languages that have proven popular across the web, including React.\nIt's difficult to tell whether open-source or closed-source AI models will win out at the moment. In reality, it's unlikely either will dominate the market in the long run. Ultimately, we'll likely see a split between closed-source and open-source models, just as we've seen with enterprise and consumer-level software programs throughout the years.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": "  Salvador Rodriguez ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms is running ads on Facebook and Instagram that steer users to online marketplaces for illegal drugs, months after The Wall Street Journal first reported that the social-media giant was facing a federal investigation over the practice.\nThe company has continued to collect revenue from ads that violate its policies, which ban promoting the sale of illicit or recreational drugs. A review by the Journal in July found dozens of ads marketing illegal substances such as cocaine and prescription opioids, including as recently as Friday. A separate analysis over recent months by an industry watchdog group found hundreds of such ads.\nI\u2019ve Been Driving an EV for a Year.

It also included a photo of a razorblade and a yellow powder arranged to spell out \u201cDMT,\u201d a psychedelic drug.\nThe Journal reported in March that federal authorities were investigating Meta for its role in the illicit sale of drugs. The nonprofit Tech Transparency Project, which investigates online platforms, reviewed Meta\u2019s ad library from March to June and found more than 450 illicit drug ads on Facebook and Instagram.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need the dark web anymore when you can just buy a Facebook ad to sell dangerous drugs or even scam people at a scale that wouldn\u2019t have been possible through the dark web,\u201d said Katie Paul, director of the Tech Transparency Project.\nMeta uses artificial-intelligence tools to moderate content, but the company\u2019s tools haven\u2019t managed to stop such drug ads, which often redirect users to other platforms where they can make purchases. The use of photos to showcase the drugs available appears to make it possible for the ads to bypass Meta\u2019s content-moderation systems.\nMeta works with law enforcement to combat this type of activity, a spokesman for the company said. The company\u2019s content-moderation teams were affected by staff cuts in recent years. The spokesman said the company has quadrupled the size of the team working on safety and security since 2016.\n\u201cOur systems are designed to proactively detect and enforce against violating content, and we reject hundreds of thousands of ads for violating our drug policies,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWe continue to invest resources and further improve our enforcement on this kind of content. Our hearts go out to those suffering from the tragic consequences of this epidemic\u2014it requires all of us to work together to stop it.\u201d\nWhen users click on the Facebook pages or Instagram accounts associated with the ads, those pages often include additional, nonsponsored photos or posts of drug-related content. Some of the accounts use names that make it clear they are for the transaction of drugs, such as the ad for DMT, which was posted by an account called \u201cDMT Vapes and Notes.\u201d\nUsers who click the links in the ads are typically taken to private group chats on the app Telegram, which isn\u2019t a Meta property. When accessed, these group chats typically show a stream of posts from the dealers that include photos of the drugs they offer, menus with prices and instructions for placing orders, according to the Journal\u2019s review and the Tech Transparency Project analysis.\nTelegram representatives didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment about the practice.\nSome of the private chats will include posts that say \u201cTD\u201d or \u201cTouchdown\u201d to indicate a successful shipment to a customer delivered via a shipping service. In some cases, the ads link to private group chats on Meta\u2019s WhatsApp encrypted messaging service, according to the Tech Transparency Project report.\nMeta disabled many of the drug ads spotted by the Journal within 48 hours of when they went live, the company spokesman said.\nAll of the ads have now been removed for violating Meta\u2019s policies, and after being contacted, the company has also banned the users who created the ads from its platform. Additionally, the company said it is using insights about new adversarial tactics garnered from investigating these ads to fan out and do additional sweeps.\nLawmakers have been discussing the need to hold technology companies responsible for what third parties post on their platforms. Efforts to do so have been complicated by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which says online platforms aren\u2019t liable for what third parties post, with a few exceptions. The Supreme Court left core elements of Section 230 unchanged after deciding on two cases involving the law in 2023.\nThe Justice Department in the past has tried to extend the reach of federal drug laws in a way that holds internet platforms culpable when companies use it to break the law. In 2011, Google agreed to pay $500 million for allowing online Canadian pharmacies to place ads targeting U.S. consumers, resulting in the unlawful importation of prescription drugs in the U.S.\nAt a Senate hearing in January, a number of parents said they think Meta and other social-media companies are responsible for the deaths of their children, including because of illegal drug sales on social platforms that led to overdoses from fentanyl, a synthetic opioid.\nChief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized at the hearing.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for everything you have all been through,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cNo one should go through the things that your families have suffered, and this is why we invest so much\u2026to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer.\u201d\nMikayla Brown, 34 years old, is among the parents who think Meta is responsible for the drug-overdose death of her child.\nHer son Elijah Ott, a 15-year-old sophomore in California who loved to skateboard and cook Cajun pasta with his mother, died last September. After his death, Brown said she found messages on his phone showing how he connected with an Instagram account selling illegal drugs and sought to purchase marijuana oil and a pharmaceutical similar to Xanax.\nIn his autopsy, Ott tested positive for the Xanax-like pharmaceutical and a larger amount of fentanyl, which was determined to be the cause of his death. Brown said she thinks the drug purchased by her son was laced with fentanyl.\nA review by the Journal showed those accounts remained live on Instagram months later. Meta disabled the accounts associated with the dealer after being contacted by the Journal.\n\u201cBecause of this app, my child does not get to live,\u201d Brown said.\nWrite to Salvador Rodriguez at salvador.rodriguez@wsj.com\nChanges in Retirement Savings Rules to Know Before Year\u2019s End\nMeta Has Run Hundreds of Ads for Cocaine, Opioids and Other Drugs\nMeta\u2019s AI Costs Surge as Digital Advertising Revenue Grows\nDelta CEO Says CrowdStrike Tech Outage Cost It $500 Million\nInside the WSJ\u2019s Investigation of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot Crash Risks\n"

The EU\u2019s move is a preliminary step. But eventual fines for breaches can be as high as 10% of global annual revenue, or 20% for repeated violations.\nMeta introduced separate, ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram in November, to ward off growing regulatory pressure over its processing of users\u2019 personal data.

If a user refuses such consent, they should have access to a less personalized version. The commission says that the likes of Meta cannot make the use of Facebook or Instagram conditional on users\u2019 consent.\nThe EU regulator\u2019s warning comes just a week after it issued a complaint over Apple Inc.\u2019s DMA compliance, telling the iPhone maker that it must allow app developers to steer users to cheaper deals and offers outside of the App Store, in order to step into line with the rules.\nAs part of the DMA, it\u2019s illegal for certain services operated by the likes of Apple, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Meta, Microsoft Corp., and Amazon.com Inc. to favor their own services over those of rivals.

Despite a 7% rise in costs during the second quarter, the substantial revenue increase led to a 9-point rise in operating margin, climbing to 38% from 29%.\nLooking ahead to Q3, Meta projected total revenue to range between $38.5 billion and $41 billion, with a midpoint of $39.75 billion, surpassing Wall Street's estimate of $39.09 billion.\nThe company also indicated it would continue significant spending on AI infrastructure, forecasting 2024 capital expenditures between $37 billion and $40 billion, up from the previous forecast of $35 billion to $40 billion.\nMeta maintained its total expense forecast for the year at $96 billion to $99 billion but warned that infrastructure costs would remain a \"significant driver\" of expense growth in 2025.\nFollowing the report\u2019s release, numerous Wall Street analysts shared predominantly bullish comments on Meta stock, raising their estimates and price targets.\n\u201cWe emerge from 2Q24 earnings incrementally positive on shares of Meta given engagement&monetization gains and expanding margins,\u201d said Citi analysts, who raised their META target price from $550 to $580.\n\u201cOn engagement, we note newer AI content recommendation models continue to drive usage across Meta\u2019s Family-of- Apps as newer AI-based use cases emerge, like search with Meta AI and Agents with AI Studio. And, while Meta is clearly ramping its investment across its Foundation Models, we believe these investments can deliver tangible short&long-term benefits.\u201d\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan analysts said Meta \u201ccontinues to earn the right to spend big on GenAI\u201d given the company\u2019s strong revenue outlook and greater clarity on the AI product roadmap.\nThe Wall Street firm set its December 2025 price target for Meta stock as high as $610, up from the $480 for December 2024.\n\u201cGenAI will require significant infrastructure investments to train the next generation of large foundational models&Meta is getting ahead of a multi-year capacity ramp, although core products will remain the primary driver of monetization through 2026,\u201d JPMorgan analysts wrote.\nOther investment firms also voiced largely bullish remarks.\nEvercore ISI: \u201cThe stock rightfully traded up 7% in the aftermarket, with META demonstrating very strong Ad revenue growth -- especially with its Q3 outlook -- ongoing product improvements, and significant margin expansion.\u201d\n\u201cLooking for returns on aggressive industry AI spend? Look no further. META has already effectively deployed AI to materially boost its consumer offerings and its advertiser offerings. And there is much more to come. And valuation is still highly reasonable at 21X P/E.\u201d\nCitizens JMP: \u201cWhile Meta\u2019s AI investment cycle is nowhere near done, the company is well positioned to continue to realize AI gains given its distribution with 3.3B people using its apps daily, while simplifying the advertising process for businesses helps to unlock latent demand from both consumers and advertisers.\u201d\n\u201cAs we look over the next few years, growth looks increasingly sustainable, while we can see the company laddering products to sustain growth and we continue to view Meta as a core holding for technology investors as we think estimates can continue to surprise to the upside.\u201d\nMorgan Stanley: \u201cMETA remains the best case study of how GPU-enabled analyses of leading first party data sets can drive material improvements. In this case it comes thru as better engagement and revenue growth (even off of large bases) and a growing list of next gen call options.\u201d\nRelated Articles\nMeta Q2 earnings: Here's what analysts have to say\nModerna reins in 2024 sales forecast, expects very low EU vaccine revenue\nDataDog upgraded at BTIG on strong checks, Splunk displacement opportunity\n"

        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nMeta earned $39 billion in revenue this quarter, a 22% YoY increase and its second-biggest quarter ever.\n3.27 billion people now use Meta apps daily, while Threads has grown to 200 million users.\nMeta CEO emphasized the continued focus on investing billions in AI and Reality Labs to keep up with competitors.\nReality Labs R&D now totals $50 billion since Meta began tracking this data in earnings reports.\nMeta maintained its strong growth in 2024, growing its total revenue by $7 billion compared to 2023 and its viewed ads by 10%. CEO Mark Zuckerberg boasted about the growth of products like Meta AI, Whatsapp, Threads, and Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses while glossing over Reality Labs' operating losses.\nOn Wednesday, Meta reported its Q2 2024 earnings. The company grew its total users to 3.27 billion, or 200 million more than last year. Zuckerberg highlighted that its X rival, Threads, now has 200 million users, while the internationally popular Whatsapp now has 100 million monthly U.S. users.\nHe also claimed that \"against public perception,\" Facebook has become much more popular with \"younger users,\" with CFO Susan Li claiming that this generation loves using Facebook Marketplace in particular.\nZuckerberg bragged multiple times that Meta AI is on track to become \"the most used AI assistant by the end of the year\" while \"improving quickly both in intelligence and features.\" He claims that it has answered billions of queries since launch, many coming from the popular Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses. Interestingly, India is the \"largest market for AI queries.\"\nFinancial analysts on the call expressed skepticism that Meta could profit from its AI investments, especially its open-source Llama 3 AI. Zuckerberg and Li emphasized that they're focusing on expanding their reach for now before \"monetizing [AI] over time\" and that AI has helped Meta better target ads to users.\nMeta only briefly touched upon Reality Labs, the R&D department dedicated to the Meta Quest 3 and its mysterious AR glasses. Zuckerberg claimed that Quest 3 sales are \"exceeding our expectations,\" but that didn't stop RL from hitting $4.5 billion in quarterly losses despite $353 million in Quest sales.\nLi attributed the higher losses to a \"20% increase due to headcount.\" In June, The Verge reported that Meta would lay off Reality Labs employees while branching off the division into a second Wearables group. In theory, these changes could reduce RL losses going forward.\nStill, Meta's total Reality Labs losses have reached a total of $50 billion since the company began reporting these numbers in Q4 2020. While future VR products like the Meta Quest 3S could mitigate some losses, it's clear that this number will only grow. Li repeated the same warning from past earnings calls on Wednesday: \"We continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts.\"\nDuring the call, Zuckerberg hinted at major announcements at\u00a0Meta Connect 2024\u00a0on September 25. We expect Meta to unveil its (intentionally) leaked AR glasses at the event, but industry reports suggest they will be a proof of concept, not a consumer-ready product.\n"

        "Text": "Meta, which develops one of the biggest foundational open source large language models, Llama, believes it will need significantly more computing power to train models in the future.\nMark Zuckerberg said on Meta's second-quarter earnings call on Tuesday that to train Llama 4, the company will need 10x more compute than what was needed to train Llama 3. But he still wants Meta to build capacity to train models rather than fall behind its competitors.\n\u201cThe amount of computing needed to train Llama 4 will likely be almost 10 times more than what we used to train Llama 3, and future models will continue to grow beyond that,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\"It's hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future. But at this point, I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new inference projects.\"\nMeta released Llama 3 with 8 billion parameters in April. The company last week released an upgraded version of the model, called Llama 3.1 405B, which had 405 billion parameters, making it Meta's biggest open source model.\nMeta's CFO, Susan Li, also said the company is thinking about different data center projects and building capacity to train future AI models. She said Meta expects this investment to increase capital expenditures in 2025.\nTraining large language models can be a costly business. Meta's capital expenditures rose nearly 33% to $8.5 billion in Q2 2024, from $6.4 billion a year earlier, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure.\nAccording to a report from The Information, OpenAI spends $3 billion on training models and an additional $4 billion on renting servers at a discount rate from Microsoft.\n\"As we scale generative AI training capacity to advance our foundation models, we\u2019ll continue to build our infrastructure in a way that provides us with flexibility in how we use it over time. This will allow us to direct training capacity to GenAI inference or to our core ranking and recommendation work, when we expect that doing so would be more valuable,\" Li said during the call.\nDuring the call, Meta also talked about its consumer-facing Meta AI's usage and said India is the largest market of its chatbot. But Li noted that the company doesn't expect Gen AI products to contribute to revenue in a significant way.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/01/zuckerberg-says-meta-will-need-10x-more-computing-power-to-train-llama-4-than-llama-3/\n"

        "Text": "By Katie Paul, Yuvraj Malik\n(Reuters) -Meta Platforms beat market expectations for second-quarter revenue on Wednesday and issued a rosy sales forecast for the third quarter, signaling that robust digital-ad spending on its social media platforms can cover the cost of its artificial-intelligence investments.\nShares of the company were up 6.8% after the bell.\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent said it anticipates third-quarter revenue in the range of $38.5 billion to $41 billion, the midpoint of which is higher than analysts' estimates of $39.1 billion, according to LSEG data.\nRevenue rose 22% to $39.1 billion for the April to June period, Meta said, compared with analysts' expectations of $38.3 billion.\nMeta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li told analysts on a call that the company was \"continuing to see healthy global advertising demand\" and was also reaping the fruits of a multiyear project to use artificial intelligence to improve targeting, ranking and delivery systems for digital ads on its platforms.\nLi and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said those tools would continue to drive growth in the coming two years, while new generative AI features like chat assistants would take longer to monetize.\nShares of social media app Snap, which likewise relies heavily on digital advertising, rose 3% after the Meta report.\n\"Any apprehensions investors may have had about Meta's spending on AI and the metaverse are likely to be allayed by this quarter's results,\" said eMarketer analyst Max Willens.\n\"With its margins as healthy as they are, Meta's investors should feel comfortable with the company's vigorous investments in its plans for the future,\" Willens added.\nAlthough Meta's costs rose 7% in the second quarter, its revenue jump topped expense growth substantially and led to a 9-point rise in operating margin, to 38% from 29%.\nFamily daily active people (DAP), a metric used by the company to track how many unique users per day open any one of its apps, was likewise up 7% year-over-year to an average of 3.27 billion for June.\nMeta's earnings come after disappointing results posted by fellow tech industry powerhouses which suggested the payoff from hefty investments in AI technology may take longer than Wall Street had hoped.\nMicrosoft said on Tuesday it would spend more money this fiscal year to build out AI infrastructure, while Google parent Alphabet warned last week that its capital spending would stay elevated for the rest of the year.\nLike both of those companies, Meta has been plowing billions of dollars into its data centers in an effort to capitalize on the generative AI boom. Its shares sank in April after it disclosed a higher-than-expected expense forecast, quickly knocking $200 billion off its stock-market value.\nThat ended a run of strong quarters for Meta, which has climbed back from a share price meltdown in 2022 by slimming its workforce and leaning in to investor excitement about generative AI technologies.\nDebra Aho Williamson, founder of research firm Sonata Insights, said she saw Meta's results as a \"bellwether\" for AI stocks.\n\"If a company can show strong results from its core business, its investments in AI will be seen more positively. If the core business is showing any sign of weakness \u2014 as we saw last week with Alphabet's YouTube\u2014then the stock may seem more risky,\" she said.\nMeta has picked up hiring over the last year, particularly of AI engineers, while continuing to quietly dissolve teams elsewhere. It said on Wednesday that its workforce was down 1% year-over-year, though Li said she expected head count to be \"meaningfully higher\" by the end of the year.\nThe social media giant also signaled it would continue to spend big on AI infrastructure, anticipating 2024 capital expenditure would come in between $37 billion and $40 billion, up $2 billion at the lower end from its previous forecast of $35 billion to $40 billion.\nIt left its total expense forecast for the year unchanged at $96 billion to $99 billion, while cautioning that infrastructure costs would continue to be a \"significant driver\" of expense growth in 2025.\nLosses associated with the company's metaverse unit Reality Labs, which produces virtual reality headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses, would also continue to \"increase meaningfully,\" it said.\nAlthough Meta executives have said the latest version of the smart glasses was a bigger hit than expected, Reality Labs lost nearly $4.5 billion in the second quarter, and Li attributed growth in the unit's revenue mainly to sales of its Quest virtual-reality headsets.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and Katie Paul in New York;Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Author": "  Orianna Rosa Royle ",
        "Text": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg joins a growing number of executives suggesting that a specific field of study is less critical for employment in today\u2019s competitive job market.\nWhat matters most, he says, is being able to \"do one thing really well.\"\nWhen asked by Bloomberg's Emily Chang, \u201cWhat should kids be studying these days?\u201d Zuckerberg emphasized the importance of critical thinking and learning values.\nRather than pinpointing a particular subject for aspiring Gen Z professionals, the billionaire Harvard dropout stressed that mastering a skill outweighs having a business or economics degree, as such tenacity can be applied across various business areas.\nZuckerberg explained his \"hiring philosophy\" by pointing to his daughter, who is 40 pages deep into writing a novel about mermaid crystals.\n\u201cIf people have shown that they can go deep and do one thing really well, then they've probably gained experience in the art of learning something and taking it to an excellent level, which is generally pretty applicable to other things,\u201d he concluded.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the Meta mastermind has insisted that raw talent and personality trump credentials.\nZuckerberg was well ahead of today\u2019s skills-first hiring revolution\u2014even back in 2015, the tech genius was insisting that he \u201cwill only hire someone to work directly for me if I would work for that person\u201d and that his team looks for people whose values align with the company's.\nNow, as businesses increasingly drop degree requirements from their hiring process, Zuckerberg\u2019s hiring philosophy is more common.\nGoogle, Microsoft, IBM, and Apple have all eliminated their long-held degree requirements to remove barriers to entry and recruit more diverse talent. Meanwhile, recruiters globally are five times more likely to search for new hires by skills over higher education.\nJPMorgan\u2019s CEO Jamie Dimon recently revealed that the Wall Street giant has hired \u201cfour or five thousand ex-felons\u201d because talent doesn\u2019t just come out of colleges.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think necessarily because you go to an Ivy League school or have great grades it means you\u2019re going to be a great worker, great person or something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at skills of people it is amazing how skilled people are in something, but it didn\u2019t show up on their resume.\nLikewise, Apple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook has echoed that there is a \u201cmismatch between the skills that are coming out of colleges and what the skills are that we believe we need in the future.\u201d\nIt\u2019s why he said that aspiring coders, in particular, don\u2019t need a degree to be successful at the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board meeting.\nCisco\u2019s top executive in the U.K., David Meads, dropped out of school at 16 years old. Like Zuckerberg, he told Fortune that \u201cattitude and aptitude are more important than whatever letters you have after your name, or whatever qualifications you\u2019ve got on a sheet.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Alexei Oreskovic ",
        "Text": "The three giants of the AI valley have spoken. What have we learned?\nNot much\u2014other than the fact that all three (Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta) see no limit to the amount of wealth they\u2019re itching to pump into their AI projects.\nOver the course of three hour-long earnings calls, the only hard numbers about AI that we heard this week related to capital expenditures. The Big Tech trio spent a combined $40.5 billion on the infrastructure, land, and chips that power their AI services during the second quarter. And each company indicated that those numbers will only get bigger next year.\nThe rest of the AI info that was served up\u2014particularly anything related to the revenue side of the ledger\u2014amounted to mostly empty rhetoric.\nLet\u2019s start with Meta. On Wednesday CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was on track to have \u201cthe world\u2019s most used AI assistant by the end of the year.\u201d\nZuck didn\u2019t provide much context to help listeners understand what this feat might mean. Is an AI assistant in the same category as a \u201ccopilot,\u201d the generative AI tool that rival Microsoft is fervently pushing to its customers? Unclear.\nLet\u2019s assume an \u201cAI assistant\u201d is a traditional chatbot, in the same class as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and Google\u2019s Gemini. How does Meta AI stack up? Search around, and you\u2019ll discover that even trying to make an apples-to-oranges comparison is not easy. Google said in May that \u201cover 1 million people have signed up to try Gemini Advanced in just three months,\u201d and on its earnings call last week CEO Sundar Pichai said that Gemini is now used in \u201call six of our products with more than 2 billion monthly users\u201d\u2014nice large numbers that don\u2019t really tell us anything. For its part, OpenAI said in May that \u201cevery week, more than a hundred million people use ChatGPT.\u201d\nAll of this suggests that Meta, which now has 3.3 billion daily users across its family of apps, could theoretically declare victory if at year\u2019s end there are 101 million people per week using the AI assistant that it has very conspicuously bolted on to Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. The bar doesn\u2019t appear to be very high.\nAs for when these Meta AI users will lift the company\u2019s top line, Zuckerberg takes a long-term view: Generative AI will not be a meaningful driver of the business for \u201cyears.\u201d Don\u2019t expect generative AI to move the needle next year, or even in 2026, Zuckerberg said\u2014AI revenue in 2025 and 2026 will come from the traditional, behind-the-scenes AI tools that the company uses to improve feed recommendations and advertising, but not from Meta AI.\nSatya Nadella had lots of impressive sounding but similarly hazy data points to share on the Microsoft earnings call, and he unleashed them in a rapid-fire barrage. Azure AI customers increased by more than 60% year over year, with roughly 60,000 customers in total. Microsoft 365 customers increased 60% from the previous quarter, with the majority of enterprise customers \u201ccoming back to purchase more seats.\u201d And the number of customers with more than 10,000 Microsoft seats more than doubled quarter over quarter, we learned, but it was left unspecified if those are all paid seats. (Microsoft confirmed after publication that they were paid seats).\nThe closest Nadella came to dropping a hard number involved GitHub, and the AI \u201ccopilot\u201d that helps computer programmers write code.\nGitHub\u2019s annual revenue \u201crun rate\u201d is now $2 billion, Nadella said. Run rates are a slippery thing, of course\u2014what is the $2 billion run rate extrapolated from: revenue rung up in the most recent quarter? Month? Day? Hour? Nadella didn\u2019t say. But he noted that copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub\u2019s revenue growth this year (note that this revenue growth is not the same thing as the just-mentioned revenue run rate, so that $2 billion number is not relevant). He then said that GitHub copilot is already a larger business than the entirety of GitHub when Microsoft acquired the company back in 2018.\nThere\u2019s no public number for GitHub\u2019s revenue at the time of its acquisition, since it was a private company. But a New York Times article at the time cites analyst estimates that GitHub\u2019s revenue was \u201crunning at $200 million a year.\u201d\nSo there you have it, one somewhat solid data point about AI from the Big Tech earnings reports: GitHub copilot\u2019s revenue is somewhere just north of $200 million a year, and very likely below $400 million (since Nadella would presumably have described the business as \u201cmore than twice the size\u201d if that were the case, right?).\nWall Street analyst notes recapping the earnings are full of commentary about \u201cstrong demand signals\u201d and promising AI uptake. And Meta\u2019s stock is riding high today, following Wednesday\u2019s earnings report, thanks to the enduring strength of its advertising business. But when you look closely at what we actually learned about generative AI, there\u2019s not much there there.\nCorrection: The number of Microsoft 365 copilot customers increased 60% in Q2, rather than doubled. And the number of customers with at least 10,000 enterprise seats more than doubled, as opposed to the total number of enterprise seats being 10,000.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "European Union accuses Facebook owner Meta of breaking digital rules with paid ad-free option",
        "Author": "  KELVIN CHAN ",
        "Text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 European Union regulators accused social media company Meta Platforms on Monday of breaching the bloc's new digital competition rulebook by forcing Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.\nMeta began giving European users the option in November of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram as a way to comply with the continent\u2019s strict data privacy rules.\nUsers can pay at least 10 euros ($10.75) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union\u2019s top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said preliminary findings of its investigation show that Meta's \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model was in breach of the 27-nation bloc\u2019s Digital Markets Act.\nMeta's model doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \u201cfreely consent\u201d to allowing their personal data from its various services, including Facebook, Instagram, Marketplace, WhatsApp, and Messenger, to be combined to target them with personalized online ads, the commission said.\nMeta's model also doesn't give users the option of a service that's less personalized but still equivalent to its social networks, it said.\n\u201cSubscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d Meta said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d\nThe commission had opened its investigation shortly after the rulebook, also known as the DMA, took effect in March. It's a sweeping set of regulations aimed at preventing tech \u201cgatekeepers\u201d from cornering digital markets under threat of heavy financial penalties.\nOne of the DMA's goals is to rein in the power of Big Tech companies that have collected vast amounts of personal data on their users, giving them an edge on rivals competing in online ad or social media services. The commission indicated that in order for Meta to comply, it would like to see an option that doesn\u2019t rely on a user\u2019s full personal information being shared for advertising.\n\u201cThe DMA is there to give back to the users the power to decide how their data is used and ensure innovative companies can compete on equal footing with tech giants on data access,\u201d European Commissioner Thierry Breton, who oversees the bloc's digital policy, said in a statement.\nMeta now has a chance to respond to the commission, which must wrap up its investigation by March 2025. The company could face fines worth 10% of its annual global revenues, which could run into the billions of euros.\nUnder the Digital Markets Act, Meta is classed as one of seven online gatekeepers while Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and its online ad business are among two dozen \u201ccore platform services\u201d that need the highest level of scrutiny.\nMonday's decision is the latest in flurry of regulatory activity by Brussels targeting Big Tech companies. The EU leveled its first charges under the DMA a week ago, accusing Apple of of preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. It also recently charged Microsoft with violating the bloc's antitrust laws by by bundling its Teams messaging and videoconferencing app with its widely used Office business software.\n"

        "Text": "Meta Platforms (META) is expected to report a 20% rise in quarterly revenue, helped by strong ad sales driven by the Olympics and elections in several countries, but investors will want to see if its spending on AI is starting to yield returns.\nThe social media giant, like its tech rivals Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft, is spending billions on tech infrastructure to support AI development. In April, Meta's upward revision in full-year expenses shaved off nearly $170 billion from its market capitalization in a single day.\nAlphabet's (GOOG) warning last week that capital expenses would stay high this year, overshadowed a jump in ad sales and pushed its stock down.\nMeta is betting on an open-source approach for its generative AI push. The company released its mostly free Llama 3.1 artificial intelligence model last week, and said developers can use and modify its AI models free of charge.\nIt has burnished its ad-buying products with AI tools and introduced new AI features such as a chat assistant to drive engagement on its social media properties. On Monday, it said it would roll out a new tool called AI Studio that would allow users to create, share and design personalized AI chatbots.\n\"We are bullish on Meta's position as a key pillar of open-source AI,\" Jefferies analysts said, adding that the company could potentially unlock new revenue streams by licensing its AI models or creating AI apps.\nMeta shares have risen 32% this year, compared with a near 16% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index.\nThe company will also need to show its bread and butter ad business is thriving when it reports second-quarter results on Wednesday.\nGroupM, one of the world's largest media buying firms, raised its 2024 global advertising growth forecast to 7.8% in June, from 5.3% in December, which augurs well for Meta.\nSmaller ad-dependent companies Pinterest (PINS) and Snap (SNAP) are scheduled to report results on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\"We remain positive on Meta and think Reels, Messaging and AI-driven ad improvements are still early, and could lead to positive product surprises and revenue upside,\" analysts at BofA Securities said.\n\"With political spend, and potential TikTok ban in 1Q'25, Meta could also see an ad spend benefit in 2H'24.\"\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Shounak Dasgupta)\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. removed 63,000 Instagram accounts in Nigeria linked to scammers who were using its social media services to blackmail targets after soliciting intimate photos, the company said Wednesday.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nVenezuela\u2019s Opposition Disputes Claim of Maduro Election Victory\nHarris\u2019 Running-Mate Search Zeroes In on Three Top Contenders\nTraders Fret as 32-Hour Central Bank Spree Hangs Over Market\nFrench Internet Lines Cut in Latest Attack During Olympics\nApple's AI Features Rollout Will Miss Upcoming iPhone Software Overhaul\nMeta, which also owns Facebook and WhatsApp, added that it had deleted thousands of additional Facebook accounts, pages and groups that were sharing scripts on how to blackmail and sexually extort users.\nThe mass removal took place at the end of May \u2014 six weeks after a Bloomberg Businessweek story on the rapid rise of financial sextortion in the US. The crime involves scammers posing as teenage girls on Instagram or Snap Inc.\u2019s Snapchat to coerce their targets into sending nude photos. Those explicit images are then used to blackmail the targets, with the perpetrators threatening to forward the images to friends and family.\nThe US Federal Bureau of Investigation says sextortion is one of the fastest-growing crimes targeting children in the US. More than two dozen minors, mainly teen boys, have killed themselves after falling victim to it since late 2021. Businessweek\u2019s April cover story focused on the self-inflicted death of Jordan DeMay, a 17-year-old football and basketball star from Marquette, Michigan. After DeMay was goaded to suicide over Instagram, local police and the FBI tracked his blackmailers to Lagos, Nigeria, and extradited two young men to the US to face wrongful death charges. They pleaded guilty in April.\nThe explosion of financial sextortion in recent years has been linked to the Yahoo Boys, a loosely affiliated group of digitally savvy con men who design scams en masse. Meta said many of the Facebook pages and groups that it removed were affiliated with members of the Yahoo Boys, who were attempting to \u201corganize, recruit and train new scammers.\u201d\nThe groups were selling blackmail scripts and scam guides. They were also sharing links to photos that could be used to legitimize fake accounts. One network of 20 individuals was running 2,500 \u201cfake accounts to mask their identities\u201d that were mainly targeting men in the US, according to Meta.\n\u201cFinancial sextortion is a horrific crime that can have devastating consequences,\u201d Meta said in the statement. Its investigation found the majority of the scammers\u2019 attempts failed. In cases where blackmailers targeted minors, Meta said it reported them to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. \u201cThis is an adversarial space where criminals evolve to evade our ever-improving defenses,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe will continue to focus on understanding how they operate so we can stay one step ahead.\u201d\nMeta has taken additional measures to better protect users against sextortion scams, including setting stricter message settings on teen accounts, sending sextortion-focused safety notices, and initially blurring nude photos sent or received by minors.\nRead this next: Inside Roblox\u2019s Pedophile Problem\n(Adds details in the first two paragraphs on how many of the removed accounts were from Instagram and Facebook.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\u2018Dancing With Death\u2019: What It\u2019s Like to Dismantle a Ship\nThe Miseducation of America\u2019s Nurse Practitioners\nJoe Rogan Invaded Austin and Became Comedy\u2019s New Kingmaker\nDisney Bets on Deadpool, Wolverine and Dirty Jokes to Save Marvel\nThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Meta Platforms is hardly the only big tech company with no plans to put the brakes on its blowout artificial-intelligence spending. It might be the only one where that news was already priced in.\nThe parent company of Facebook and Instagram used its second-quarter report on Wednesday to announce plans to make between $37 billion and $40 billion in capital expenditures this year. That is up from the prior range of $35 billion to $40 billion that the company gave three months ago\u2014essentially a 3% raise at the midpoint.\nIntel to Cut Jobs and Suspend Dividend in Cost-Saving Push\nAmazon Shares Slide as Spending Surges and Revenue Outlook Disappoints\nApple\u2019s iPhone Sales Slide, but Investors Still Expect AI Rally\nAfter Years of Raising Prices, Food Companies Hit Consumers\u2019 Limits\nWeak Economic Data Prompts Stock Selloff\nEither one is a tidy sum given Meta\u2019s size\u2014at least relative to its other megacap tech peers. An outlay of $37 billion would represent 23% of what Wall Street projects for Meta\u2019s total revenue this year. Amazon.com, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet are projected to devote between 10% and 20% of their revenue to capex over the same period, according to consensus estimates from FactSet. And for good measure, Meta also said Wednesday that it expects \u201csignificant capital expenditures growth\u201d in 2025. Three months ago the company simply said capex \u201cwill continue to increase\u201d in the next year.\nIt was basically the same message on that front that Microsoft and Google broadcast in their recent reports. But Meta\u2019s stock jumped more than 7% in after-hours trading following its Wednesday afternoon release, compared with respective drops of 1% and 5% for Microsoft and Alphabet following their results. Meta\u2019s revenue beat Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimate by a slightly wider margin than those other two. It also helps that the stock had already experienced sticker shock from AI spending plans broadcast in the last earnings season. Meta is the only one of the six trillion-dollar tech megacaps to have seen its shares lose ground between its March quarter report and the latest one.\nMeta\u2019s turbulent record over the past few years shows that its investors are willing to roll with expensive ambitions as long as the core business holds up and other costs are held down. That is proving to be the case now. Advertising revenue grew 22% year over year to $38.3 billion, which was $3 billion higher than what Wall Street expected. Operating income of $14.8 billion also beat analysts\u2019 estimates, despite a loss of nearly $4.5 billion in the Reality Labs division that houses the company\u2019s VR and metaverse efforts.\nThe company is also keeping to the lessons of its \u201cyear of efficiency.\u201d Head count grew by 1,470 in the June period, but remains 19% below the company\u2019s peak in late 2022. Revenue per employee is up 51% from that time.\nStill, investors are getting antsier about the expensive race to build generative-AI services. It is a boon for Nvidia: The AI chip star\u2019s stock jumped more than 3% in after-hours trading Wednesday following Meta\u2019s results after surging nearly 13% in the regular session following Microsoft\u2019s report. Capex questions from analysts dominated both earnings calls, and Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg maintained his previously stated view that Meta\u2019s direct payoff from genAI services isn\u2019t close at hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone should be surprised that I would expect that that will be years,\u201d he said on Wednesday\u2019s call.\nYears are something the 40-year-old centibillionaire has. And years it might take, given the still tight supply of Nvidia\u2019s most powerful chips. Zuckerberg showed up on stage with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at a conference on Monday, with the two joking about the 600,000 GPU chips Meta has already bought from the company.\nHuang is laughing all the way to the bank now. Zuckerberg eventually needs to ensure that his company\u2019s AI spending doesn\u2019t become a punchline.\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com\nDon Lemon Sues Elon Musk and X for Canceling Partnership Deal\nVenu Sports Streaming Service to Cost $42.99 a Month\nNike Paid Him to Make Gold-Dipped Sneakers for LeBron.

Thanks, Ken, and hey, everyone. Thanks for joining today. This was a strong quarter for our community and business. We estimate that there are now more than 3.2 billion people using at least one of our apps each day. The growth we're seeing here in the US has especially been a bright spot. WhatsApp now serves more than 100 million monthly actives in the US, and we're seeing good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads as well, both in the US and globally.I'm particularly pleased with the progress that we're making with young adults on Facebook. The numbers we're seeing, especially in the US, really go against the public narrative around who's using the app. A couple of years ago, we started focusing our apps more on 18 to 29 year olds, and it's good to see that those efforts are driving good results. Another bright spot is Threads, which is about to hit 200 million monthly actives. We're making steady progress towards building what looks like it's going to be another major social app. And we're seeing deeper engagement and I'm quite pleased with the trajectory here.The big theme right now is, of course, AI, and I'll focus my comments today on three areas: what AI means for our family of apps and core business, what new AI experiences and opportunities we see, and how AI is shaping our metaverse work. So let's start. Across Facebook and Instagram, advances in AI continue to improve the quality of recommendations and drive engagement. And we keep finding that as we develop more general recommendation models, content recommendations get better.In this quarter, we rolled out our fullscreen video player and unified video recommendation service across Facebook, bringing real longer videos and live into a single experience. And this has allowed us to extend our unified AI systems, which had already increased engagement on Facebook Reels more than our initial move from CPUs to GPUs did.Over time, I'd like to see us move towards a single unified recommendation system that powers all of the content, including things like people you may know across all of our services. We're not there yet. There's still upside and we're making good progress here.AI is also going to significantly evolve our services for advertisers in some exciting ways. It used to be that advertisers came to us with a specific audience they wanted to reach, like a certain age group, geography or interest. Eventually, we got to the point where our ad systems could better predict who would be interested than the advertisers could themselves. But today, advertisers still need to develop creative themselves. And in the coming years, AI will be able to generate creative for advertisers as well, and will also be able to personalize it as people see it.Over the long term, advertisers will basically just be able to tell us a business objective and a budget, and we're going to go do the rest for them. We're going to get there incrementally over time, but I think this is going to be a very big deal.Moving on to some of the brand-new experiences that AI enables, last quarter, we started broadly rolling out our assistant, Meta AI, and it is on track to achieve our goal of becoming the most used AI assistant by the end of the year. We have an exciting road map ahead of things that we want to add. But the bottom line here is that Meta AI feels like it is on track to be an important service, and it's improving quickly both in intelligence and features. Some of the use cases are utilitarian, like searching for information or role-playing difficult conversations before you have them with another person. And other uses are more creative like the new Imagine Yourself feature that lets you create images of yourself doing whatever you want in whatever style you want.And part of the beauty of AI is that it's general. So we're still uncovering the wide range of use cases that it's valuable for. An important part of our vision is that we're not just creating a single AI but enabling lots of people to create their own AIs. And this week, we launched AI Studio, which lets anyone create AIs to interact with across our apps. I think the creators are especially going to find this quite valuable.There are millions of creators across our apps, and these are people who want to engage more with their communities, and their communities want to engage more with them. But there are only so many hours in the day. So now they're going to be able to use AI Studio to create AI agents that can channel them to chat with their community, answer people's questions, create content and more. So I'm quite excited about this. But this goes beyond creators, too. Anyone is going to be able to build their own AIs based on their interests or different topics that they are going to be able to engage with or share with their friends.Business AIs are the other big piece here. We're still in alpha testing with more and more businesses. The feedback we're getting is positive so far. Over time, I think that just like every business has a website, a social media presence, and an e-mail address, in the future, I think that every business is also going to have an AI agent that their customers can interact with. And our goal is to make it easy for every small business, eventually every business, to pull all of their content and catalog into an AI agent that drives sales and saves them money. When this is working at scale, I think that this is going to dramatically accelerate our business messaging revenue. There are a lot of other new opportunities here that I'm excited about too, but I'll save those for another day when we're ready to roll them out.The engine that powers all these new experiences is the Llama family of foundation models. In this quarter, we released Llama 3.1, which includes the first frontier-level open source model as well as new and industry-leading small- and medium-sized models. The 405 billion model has better cost performance relative to the leading closed models. And because it's open, it is immediately the best choice for fine-tuning and distilling your own custom models of whatever size you need. I think we're going to look back at Llama 3.1 as an inflection point in the industry where open-source AI started to become the industry standard just like Linux is.I often get asked why I'm so bullish on open source. I wrote a letter, along with the Llama 3.1 release, explaining why I believe that open source is better for developers, for Meta, and for the world more broadly. My view is that open source will be safer, will enable innovation that improves all of our lives faster and will also create more shared prosperity.For Meta's own interests, we're in the business of building the best consumer and advertiser experiences. And to do that, we need to have access to the leading technology infrastructure and not get constrained by what competitors will let us do. But these models are ecosystems. They're not just kind of isolated pieces of software that we can develop by ourselves.So if we want the most robust ecosystem of tools, efficiency improvements, silicon optimizations, and other integrations to develop around our models, then we need them to be widely used by developers across the industry. And once we know that we're going to have access to the leading models, then I'm confident that we're going to be able to build the best social and advertising experiences.Part of why I'm so optimistic about this is that we have a long track record of success with open source. We've saved billions of dollars with Open Compute Project by having supply chain standardized on our infra designs. Open sourcing tools like PyTorch and React has led to real benefits for us from all of the industry's contributions. This approach has consistently worked for us and I expect it will work here, too.Another major area of focus is figuring out the right level of infra capacity to support training more and more advanced models. Llama 3 is already competitive with the most advanced models, and we're already starting to work on Llama 4, which we're aiming to be the most advanced in the industry next year. We are planning for the compute clusters and data we'll need for the next several years. The amount of compute needed to train Llama 4 will likely be almost 10x more than what we used to train Llama 3.And future models will continue to grow beyond that. It's hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future. But at this point, I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new infra projects. And as we scale these investments, we're of course going to remain committed to operational efficiency across the company.The last area that I want to discuss is how AI is shaping our metaverse work, which continues to be our other long-term focus. Last quarter, I discussed how advances in AI have pulled in the timelines for some of our products. A few years ago, I would have predicted that holographic AR would be possible before smart AI, but now it looks like those technologies will actually be ready in the opposite order.We're well positioned for that because of the Reality Labs investments that we've already made. Ray-Ban Meta glasses continue to be a bigger hit sooner than we expected, thanks in part to AI. Demand is still outpacing our ability to build them, but I'm hopeful that we'll be able to meet that demand soon. EssilorLuxottica has been a great partner to work with on this, and we are excited to team up with them to build future generations of AI glasses as we continue to build our long-term partnership. Quest 3 sales are also outpacing our expectations. And I think that's because it is not just the best MR headset for the price but it's the best headset on the market, period.In addition to gaming, people are increasingly taking advantage of Quest's capabilities as a general computing platform, spending time watching videos, browsing websites, extending their PC via virtual desktop and more. Horizon also continues to grow across the VR, mobile, and desktop, and I expect that it will become an increasingly important part of that ecosystem as well. We're hosting our annual Connect Conference on September 25, and we will have lots of exciting updates around all of our AI and metaverse work, so I encourage you to tune into that.At the end of the day, we are in the fortunate position where the strong results that we're seeing in our core products and business give us the opportunity to make deep investments for the future. And I plan to fully seize that opportunity to build some amazing things that will pay off for our community and our investors for decades to come. The progress we're making on both the foundational technology and product experiences suggests that we're on the right track. I'm proud of what our team has accomplished so far, and I'm optimistic about our ability to execute on the opportunities ahead. As always, thank you to our teams who are pushing all this important work forward, and thanks to all of you for being on this journey with us.And now here's Susan.\nSusan Li\nThanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $39.1 billion, up 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis. Q2 total expenses were $24.2 billion, up 7% compared to last year.In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 23%, driven primarily by higher infrastructure and Reality Labs inventory costs. R&D increased 13%, primarily driven by higher headcount-related expenses and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Marketing and sales decreased 14% due mainly to lower restructuring and headcount-related costs. G&A decreased 12% mostly due to lower legal-related expenses.We ended the first quarter with almost 70,800 employees, up 2% from Q1. Second-quarter operating income was $14.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 11%. Net income was $13.5 billion or $5.16 per share.Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $8.5 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $10.9 billion. We repurchased $6.3 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt.Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our family of apps segment. Our community across the family of apps continues to grow, with approximately 3.27 billion people using at least one of our family of apps on a daily basis in June. Q2 total family of apps revenue was $38.7 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Q2 family of apps ads revenue was $38.3 billion, up 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis.Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by gaming and entertainment and media. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in rest of world and Europe at 33% and 26%, respectively. Asia Pacific grew 20% and North America grew 17%. On an advertiser geography basis, total revenue growth continued to be strongest in Asia Pacific at 28%, though growth was below the first quarter rate of 41% as we lapped a period of stronger demand from China-based advertisers.In Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services and the average price per ad both increased 10%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia Pacific and rest of world. Pricing growth was driven by increased advertiser demand, in part due to improved ad performance. This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing regions and services. Family of apps other revenue was $389 million, up 73%, driven primarily by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp business platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our family of apps.In Q2, family of apps expenses were $19.4 billion, representing approximately 80% of our overall expenses. Family of apps expenses were up 4%, mostly due to higher infrastructure and headcount-related expenses, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Family of apps operating income was $19.3 billion, representing a 50% operating margin.Within our Reality Labs segment, Q2 was $353 million, up 28%, driven primarily by Quest headset sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.8 billion, up 21% year over year, driven mainly by higher headcount-related expenses and Reality Labs inventory costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $4.5 billion.Turning now to the business outlook, there are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. To deliver engaging experiences, we remain focused on executing our priorities, including video and in-feed recommendations. On Instagram, Reels engagement continues to grow as we make ongoing enhancements to our recommendation systems. Part of this work has been focused on increasing the share of original posts within recommendations so people can discover the best of Instagram, including content from emerging creators. Now, more than half of recommendations in the US come from original posts.On Facebook, we're seeing encouraging early results from the global rollout of our unified video player and ranking systems in June. This initiative allows us to bring all video types on Facebook into one viewing experience, which we expect will unlock additional growth opportunities for short-form video as we increasingly mix shorter videos into the overall base of Facebook video engagement.We expect the relevance of video recommendations will continue to increase as we benefit from unifying video ranking across Facebook and integrating our next-generation recommendation systems. These have already shown promising gains since we began using the new systems to support Facebook Reels recommendations last year. We expect to expand these new systems to support more surfaces beyond Facebook video over the course of this year and next year.We're also seeing good momentum with our longer-term engagement priorities, including generative AI and Threads. People have used Meta AI for billions of queries since we first introduced it. We're seeing particularly promising signs on WhatsApp in terms of retention and engagement, which has coincided with India becoming our largest market for Meta AI usage. You can now use Meta AI in over 20 countries and 8 languages. And in the US, we're rolling out new features like Imagine Edit, which allows people to edit images they generate with Meta AI.Beyond generative AI, the Threads community also continues to grow and deepen their engagement as we ship new features and enhance our content recommendation systems.Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. There are two parts to this work. The first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to see opportunities to grow ad supply on lower monetizing surfaces like video, including within Facebook as the mix of overall video engagement shifts more to shorter videos over time, which creates more ad insertion opportunity.More broadly, we are continuing to get better at determining the best ads to show and when to show them during a person session across both Facebook and Instagram. This is enabling us to drive revenue growth and conversions without increasing the number of ads or, in some cases, even reducing ad load.The second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance. We continue to be pleased with our progress here, with AI playing an increasingly central role. We're improving ad delivery by adopting more sophisticated modeling techniques made possible by AI advancements, including our Meta Lattice ad ranking architecture, which continued to provide ad performance and efficiency gains in the second quarter.We're also making it easier for advertisers to maximize ad performance and automate more of their campaign setup with our Advantage+ suite of solutions. We're seeing these tools continue to unlock performance gains, with a study conducted this year demonstrating 22% higher return on ad spend for US advertisers after they adopted Advantage+ shopping campaigns.Advertiser adoption of these tools continues to expand, and we're adding new capabilities to make them even more useful. For example, this quarter, we introduced flexible format to Advantage+ shopping, which allows advertisers to upload multiple images and videos in a single ad that we can select from and automatically determine which format to serve in order to yield the best performance. We have also now expanded the list of conversions that businesses can optimize for using Advantage+ shopping to include an additional 10 conversion types, including objectives like add to cart.Looking forward, we believe generative AI will play a growing role in how businesses market and engage with customers at scale. We expect this technology will continue to make it easier for businesses to develop customized and diverse ad creatives. We've seen promising early results since introducing our first generative AI ad features, image expansion, background generation, and text generation, with more than 1 million advertisers using at least one of these solutions in the past month. In May, we began rolling out full image generation capabilities into Advantage+ creative, and we're already seeing improved performance from advertisers using the tool.Finally, we expect AI will help businesses communicate with customers more efficiently through messaging. We're starting by testing the ability for businesses to use AI in their chats with customers to help sell their goods and services and to generate leads. While we are in the early stages, we continue to expand the number of advertisers we're testing with and have seen good advances in the quality of responses since we began using Llama 3.Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation, which remains unchanged. We continue to invest both in enhancing our core experiences in the near term and developing technologies that we believe will transform how people engage with our services in the years ahead. We expect that having sufficient compute capacity will be central to many of these opportunities. So we are investing meaningfully in infrastructure to support our core AI work in content ranking and ads as well as our generative AI and advanced research efforts.Our ongoing investment in core AI capacity is informed by the strong returns we've seen and expect to deliver in the future as we advance the relevance of recommended content and ads on our platform. While we expect the returns from generative AI to come in over a longer period of time, we are mapping these investments against the significant monetization opportunities that we expect to be unlocked across customized ad creative, business messaging, a leading AI assistant, and organic content generation.As we scale generative AI training capacity to advance our foundation models, we will continue to build our infrastructure in a way that provides us with flexibility in how we use it over time. This will allow us to direct training capacity to gen AI inference or to our core ranking and recommendation work when we expect that doing so would be more valuable. We will also continue our focus on improving the cost efficiency of our workloads over time.Reality Labs remains our other long-term initiative that we continue to invest meaningfully in. Quest 3 is selling well and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are showing very promising traction with the early signals that we are seeing across demand, usage, and retention increasing our confidence in the long-run potential of AR glasses. Finally, as we pursue these investments across near and long-term priorities, we will remain focused on operating the business efficiently.Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect third-quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $38.5 billion to $41 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates.Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96 (technical difficulty) with our expanded infrastructure footprint. Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion, updated from our prior range of $35 billion to $40 billion. While we continue to refine our plans for next year, we currently expect significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.In closing, Q2 was another good quarter. We continue to execute well across our business priorities and have exciting opportunities in front of us to deliver more value to the people and businesses using our products around the world.With that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Brian Nowak, Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak\nI have two: one for Mark, one for Susan. Mark, I wanted to sort of go back to some of the new generative AI-enabled use cases for users and advertisers. You talked about Meta AI, Studio, chatbots, [foundation] models. If you could just sort of hone in on one or two of those that you're most excited about, where you're seeing good signal that could be a real driver for the business in '25, '26, just so we sort of know where are you most focused on all those opportunities, it'd be helpful.And the second one, Susan, you have a lot of CapEx priorities from building new infrastructure for next-generation models, compute capacity. Just walk us through again on the CapEx philosophy and any guardrails you have around ensuring you generate a healthy return on invested capital for investors from all the CapEx.\nMark Zuckerberg\nI can take the first one. So I think the things that will drive the most results in '25 and '26 are actually the first category of things that I talked about in my comments, which are the ways that AI is shaping the existing products. So the ways that it's improving recommendations and helping people find better content as well as making the advertising experiences more effective. I think there's a lot of upside there. Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we're doing is going to improve that. It will improve the experience and the business results.The other areas that we're working on, I mean, I think you all know this from following our business for a while, but we have a relatively long business cycle of starting a new product, scaling it to something that reaches 1 billion people or more, and only then really focusing on monetizing at scale. So realistically, for things like Meta AI or AI Studio, these are things that I think will increase engagement in our products and have other benefits that will improve the business and engagement in the near term. But before we're really talking about monetization of any of those things by themselves, I mean, I don't think that anyone should be surprised that I would expect that that will be years, right? I think that that's like what we've seen with Reels. It's what we sell with all these things.But I think for those who have followed our business for a long time, you can also get a pretty good sense of when things are going to work years in advance. And I think that the people who bet on those early indicators tend to do pretty well, which is why I wanted to share in my comments the early indicator that we had on Meta AI, which is, I mean, look, it's early. Last quarter, we -- I think it just started rolling it out a week or two before our earnings call. This time, we're a few months later. And what we can say is I think we are on track to achieve our goal of being the most used AI assistant by the end of this year. And I think that's a pretty big deal.Is that the only thing we want to do? No. I mean, we obviously want to grow that and grow the engagement on that to be a lot deeper, and then we'll focus on monetizing it over time. But the early signals on this are good, and I think that that's kind of all that we could reasonably have insight into at this point. But I do think that part of what's so fundamental about AI is it's going to end up affecting almost every product that we have in some way. It will improve the existing ones and will make a whole lot of new ones possible. So it's why there are all the jokes about how all the tech CEOs get on these earnings calls and just talk about AI the whole time. It's because it's actually super exciting, and it's going to change all these different things over multiple time horizons.\nSusan Li\nAnd Brian, I can take the second question. On the ROI part of your question, I would broadly characterize our AI investments into two buckets: core AI and gen AI. And the two are really at different stages as it relates to driving revenue for our businesses and our ability to measure returns.On our core AI work, we continue to take a very ROI-based approach to our investment here. We're still seeing strong returns as improvements to both engagement and ad performance have translated into revenue gains, and it makes sense for us to continue investing here. Gen AI is where we're much earlier, as Mark just mentioned in his comments. We don't expect our gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in '24. But we do expect that they're going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment while we're also open sourcing subsequent generations of Llama.And we've talked about the four primary areas that we're focused here on the gen AI opportunities to enhance the core ads business, to help us grow in business messaging, the opportunities around Meta AI, and the opportunities to grow core engagement over time.The other thing I would say is we're continuing to build our AI infrastructure with fungibility in mind so that we can flex capacity where we think it will be put to best use. The infrastructure that we build for gen AI training can also be used for gen AI inference. We can also use it for ranking and recommendations by making certain modifications like adding general compute and storage. And we're also employing a strategy of staging our data center sites at various phases of development, which allows us to flex up to meet more demand and less lead time if needed while limiting how much spend we're committing to in the outer years. So while we do expect that we are going to grow CapEx significantly in 2025, we feel like we have a good framework in place in terms of thinking about where the opportunities are and making sure that we have the flexibility to deploy it as makes the most sense.\nOperator\nMark Shmulik, Bernstein.\nMark Shmulik\nJust as we look at the revenue guidance and the outlook, Susan, any color you can share on just kind of the state of the overall digital ad market? And you've highlighted some areas where you're seeing strength versus kind of some of the idiosyncratic efforts you've made to kind of improve the efficacy of the ad product.\nSusan Li\nWe're continuing to see healthy global advertising demand, and we're also delivering ongoing ad performance improvements just related to all of the investments that we've continued to make over time in improving the sort of ads, targeting ranking, delivery, all of the fundamental infrastructure there. And we expect that all of that will continue to benefit ad spend in Q3. We do expect year-over-year growth to slow in Q3 as we are lapping strong growth from China-based advertisers as well as strong Reels impression growth from a year ago. And we also expect modestly larger FX headwinds in Q3 based on current rates.\nOperator\nEric Sheridan, Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan\nI'll just ask one. You called out building community size and what's happened in the United States as well as Threads. How are you thinking about those newer faster-growing elements of either Messaging or Threads as a platform and the mix between the potential for engagement growth and overall monetization longer term of either the messaging layer or Threads and what you're most excited about there to build to sort of capitalize on scale but bring it back towards monetization?\nMark Zuckerberg\nI can start, and Susan can jump in if she has anything else that she wants to add. So the WhatsApp stat, I think, is really important as a business trend just because the United States punches above its weight in terms of, it's such a large percent of our revenue.So before, WhatsApp was sort of the leading messaging app in many countries around the world but not in the US And I think now that we're starting to make inroads into leading in the US as more and more people use the product and realize that, hey, it was a really good experience, the best experience for cross-platform communication and groups and on all these different things, I think that, that's going to just mean that all of the work that we're doing to grow the business opportunity there over time is just going to have a big tailwind if the US ends up being a big market.So that's one reason why it's really relevant. It's obviously also personally somewhat gratifying to see all the people around us starting to use WhatsApp, so I think that's pretty fun but maybe somewhat less relevant from a business perspective. Threads, I think it's another example of something that it got off to about as good of a start of any app that I can think of. I think it was the fastest-growing app to 100 million people. And it's a good reminder that even when you have that start, the path from there to 1 billion people using an app is still multiple years. And that's our product cycle.And I think that that's something that is a little bit different about Meta in the way we build consumer products and the business around them than a lot of other companies that ship something and start selling it and making revenue from it immediately. So I think that's something that our investors and folks thinking about analyzing the business, if needed, to always grapple with is all these new products, we ship them and then there's a multiyear time horizon between scaling them and then scaling them into not just consumer experiences but very large businesses.But the thing that I think is just super exciting about Threads is that we've been building this company for 20 years, and there are just not that many opportunities that come around to grow 1 billion-person app. I mean, there are, I don't know, maybe a dozen of them in the world or something, right? I mean, there are certainly more of them outside the company than inside the company, but we do pretty well and being able to add another one to the portfolio if we execute really well on this is just really exciting to have that potential.Now obviously, there's a ton of work between now and there. I mean, we're almost at 200 million. So it's a really good milestone, I'm excited about that. A lot of work between this and it being a large part of the business. But I do think that these kind of opportunities are pretty rare and that's something that we're just really excited about. I think the team is doing great work on it.\nSusan Li\nEric, I would just add to that in terms of nearer-term sources of impression growth, we really expect that video is going to remain a source of impression growth for us in the second half. On Instagram, we expect Reels to continue to drive growth, while on Facebook, we expect to grow overall video time while increasing the mix of short-form video, which creates more impression growth opportunities. And generally, we expect continued community growth across our apps.\nOperator\nDoug Anmuth, JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth\nOne for Mark, one for Susan. Mark, just in terms of infrastructure and CapEx, you've talked about currently building out not just for Llama 3 and 4 but really out to 7 perhaps and then Llama 4, 10x the compute required versus Llama 3. Just given how much you're building ahead, how does that influence the shape of the CapEx curve over a multiyear period?And then Susan, if you could talk a little bit more about the 3Q outlook. I know you're talking about tougher comps, but at the same time, it really suggests only one point of FX neutral decel at the high end. So just curious if there's anything else you can point to more specifically that's driving the expected strength here.\nSusan Li\nThanks, Doug. I can go ahead and talk about both of those. So your first question was sort of about the longer-term CapEx outlook. We haven't really shared an outlook sort of on the longer-term CapEx trajectory. In part, infrastructure is an extraordinarily dynamic planning area for us right now. We're continuing to work through what the scope of the gen AI road maps will look like over that time.Our expectation, obviously again, is that we are going to significantly increase our investments in AI infrastructure next year, and we'll give further guidance as appropriate. But we are building all of that CapEx, again with the factors in mind that I talked about previously, thinking about both how to build it flexibly so we can deploy to core AI and gen AI use cases as needed and making sure that we both feel good about the returns that we're seeing on the core AI investments, which we're able to measure more immediately. And then we feel good about the opportunities in the gen AI efforts.Your second question was about the Q3 revenue outlook. Again, I mentioned this earlier, we have seen healthy global advertising demand on our platform. We're delivering ongoing ad performance improvements, which, again, we feel like is a result of many, many quarters of effort that have accrued and will continue to accrue value to our platform. And we saw basically in Q2 where revenue grew 22%, that there was broad-based strength across regions and verticals, including particular strength among smaller advertisers, and we expect that generally to continue into Q3.\nOperator\nJustin Post, Bank of America.\nJustin Post\nI just want to get back to the comment on US young adult user growth, especially maybe on Facebook and Instagram. I know you made a big change with Reels a couple of years ago. But what are those users doing on Facebook and Instagram? And can you give us any quantification of the usage growth?\nSusan Li\nThanks, Justin. So building products with young adults in mind has been a core priority area for the Facebook team in recent years, and we've been very encouraged to see these efforts translate into engagement growth with this cohort. We've seen healthy growth in young adult app usage in the US and Canada for the past several quarters.And we've seen that products like Groups and Marketplace have seen particular traction with young adults. Posting to groups in the US and Canada has been growing. That's been boosted mainly by young adults. And we also see that they are active users of Marketplace, which has benefited from product improvements and strong demand for secondhand products in the US.\nOperator\nMark Mahaney, Evercore ISI.\nMark Stephen Mahaney\nI was going to ask about Marketplace so that's a nice segue. It's a great, somewhat under-monetized or arguably very under-monetized asset. I know you indirectly monetize it and it's a very large marketplace. It may even be bigger than eBay. Your thoughts on what you may want to do in the future in terms of monetizing it, in part, maybe even improve the quality of the Marketplace.And then secondly, I just want to ask you about headcount. It's down about 1% year over year. You're pretty much back at par with where the employee headcount was prior to significant reduction. How should we think about headcount growth going forward? Did you talk about a significant growth in CapEx? Should we expect a moderate growth in headcount significant? Any thoughts on that would be helpful.\nSusan Li\nThanks, Mark. On your first question about Marketplace, again, we're obviously excited that it's been one of the drivers of strength in young adults. I would probably just say that more generally, Marketplace is one prong in a broader commerce strategy that we have, which continues to be focused on basically creating the best shopping experience on our platform.Marketplace is obviously consumer-oriented. The broader part of the commerce strategy is about making it easier for businesses to advertise their products, for buyers to find and purchase relevant items on our platform. And to that end, I would say that we feel quite happy with also the investments we've been making in Shops ads. Shops ads revenue is growing at a strong year-over-year pace. We're seeing Shops ads drive incremental performance for advertisers, and it's also working well in combination with some of our other products like Advantage+ shopping.Your second question was about headcount. We continue to be disciplined about where we're allocating new headcount to ensure that it's really focused on our core company priorities, but we're also working down a prior hiring underrun.And as we further close that hiring underrun over the course of this year, I do expect that we will end 2024 with in-seat reported headcount that is meaningfully higher than where we ended 2023. We aren't providing sort of 2025 headcount growth expectations yet as we haven't started our budgeting process yet. But again, I expect that we will primarily target our hiring to focus on priority areas, and we will be running a very disciplined headcount process.\nOperator\nYoussef Squali, Truist Securities.\nYoussef Squali\nSo the AI system using Llama 3.1 has been incorporated in different variations and looks really impressive and seems to be getting closer to becoming a full search engine for virtually everything except for commercial queries so far. So are there any plans to open it up to the broader web? Kind of like what may be OpenAI is off to testing, maybe link it to third-party marketplaces for commercial search, et cetera.And then on Ray-Ban, can you maybe talk a little bit more about the opportunity to deepen your relationship with EssilorLuxottica? What would that look like? What kind of areas are the most exciting to you, Mark, in that relationship?\nMark Zuckerberg\nYes. I'm very excited with how Llama 3.1 landed. I think the team there is doing really great work going from the first version of Llama, the Llama 2 last year that was a generation behind the frontier and now Llama 3.1, which is basically competitive and, in some ways, leading the other top closed models. Meta AI uses a version of Llama 3.1 as well as a bunch of other services that we've built to kind of build a cohesive product.And when I was talking before about we have the initial usage trends around Meta AI but there's a lot more that we want to add, things like commerce and you can just go vertical by vertical and build out specific functionality to make it useful in all these different areas are eventually, I think, what we're going to need to do to fulfill the potential around just being the ideal AI assistant for people.So it's a long road map. I don't think that this stuff is going to get finished in the next couple of quarters or anything like that. But this is part of what's going to happen over the next few years as we build something that will, I think, just be a very widely used service. So I'm quite excited about that. And we're going to continue working on Llama, too. So I mean, you mentioned Llama, and I think the question was a little more about Meta AI but they're both -- I mean, they're related. Llama is sort of like the engine that powers the product and it's open source, and I'm just excited about the progress that we're making on both of those.On the smart glasses, EssilorLuxottica is a great partner. We are now in the second generation of the Ray-Ban Meta glasses. They're doing well, better than I think we had expected, and we expected them to grow meaningfully from the first generation so that's been a very positive surprise. And I think part of that is that it's just well positioned to dovetail well with the AI revolution that we're seeing and offering all kinds of new functionality there. So that was great.But EssilorLuxottica is a great company that has a lot of different products that we hope to be able to partner with to just continue building new generations of the glasses and deepen the AI product and make it better and better. I think there's a lot more to go from here. And compared to what we thought at this point, it's doing quite well compared to, I think, what it needs to be, to be like a really leading piece of consumer electronics, I think we're still early but all the signs are good.\nOperator\nRon Josey, Citi.\nRonald Josey\nI want to get back, Mark, to the commentary on open source and Llama 3. Totally understand that Meta is not offering a public cloud, and so what I wanted to hear from you is maybe a little bit more on the product vision of products that come out of Llama 3. And meaning potentially offering some of these products to other companies, call it, for customer service or call center offerings or other verticals. And so any insights on just how you envision maybe the open source and Llama 3.1 can sort of offer greater enterprise services for others to benefit from?\nMark Zuckerberg\nSo Llama is the foundation model that people can shape into all kind of different products. So whether it's Meta AI for ourselves or the AI Studio or the business agents or like the assistant that's in the Ray-Ban glasses, like all these different things are basically products that have been built with Llama.And similarly, any developer out there is going to be able to take it and build a whole greater diversity of different things as well. Like I talked about, I think the reason why open sourcing -- this is so valuable for us is that we want to make sure that we have the leading infrastructure to power the consumer and business experiences that we're building.But the infrastructure, it's not just a piece of software that we can build in isolation. It really is an ecosystem with a lot of different capabilities that other developers and people are adding to the mix, whether that's new tools to distill the models into the size that you want for a custom model, or ways to fine-tune things better or make inference more efficient or all different other kinds of methods that we haven't even thought of yet, the silicon optimizations that the silicon companies are doing, all the stuff. It's an ecosystem. So we can't do all that ourselves.And if we built Llama and just kind of kept it within our walls, then it wouldn't actually be as valuable for us to build all the products that we're building as it's going to end up being. So that's the business strategy around that. And that's why we don't feel like we need to necessarily build a cloud and sell it directly in order for it to be a really positive business strategy for us.And part of what we're doing is working closely with AWS, I think, especially did great work for this release. Other companies like Databricks, NVIDIA, of course, other big players like Microsoft with Azure, and Google Cloud, they're all supporting this. And we want developers to be able to get it anywhere. I think that's one of the advantages of an open source model like Llama is -- it's not like you're locked into one cloud that offers that model, whether it's Microsoft with OpenAI or Google with Gemini or whatever it is, you can take this and use it everywhere and we want to encourage that. So I'm quite excited about that.The enterprise and business applications that we're going to be most focused on, though, in addition to just optimizing the advertiser experience like I talked about in my comments earlier, it is the business agent piece. I just think that there's a huge potential like I said earlier. I think pretty much every business today has an e-mail address, they have a website, they have social media accounts. I think in the future, they're going to have at least one, if not multiple, business agents that can do the whole range of things from interacting to help people buy things to helping support the sales that they've done if they have issues with the product, if they need to get in touch with you for something.And we already see people interacting with businesses over messaging working quite well in countries that have low cost of labor. But the thing is that in order to have someone answering everyone's questions is quite expensive in a lot of countries. And I think that this is like a thing that AI, I think, is just going to be very well suited towards doing.And when we can make that easy for the hundreds of millions of businesses that use our platforms to pull in all their information and their catalogs and the history and all the content that they've shared and really just quickly stand up an agent, I think that's going to be awesome. So we can combine Llama with a lot of custom work that we're doing in our business teams and couple that with all the other investment that the rest of the ecosystem is doing to make Llama good. And I think that's going to be huge, but that's just one area. This really goes across all of the different products that we're building, both consumer and business. So it's a lot of exciting stuff.\nKenneth Dorell\nKrista, we have time for one last question.\nOperator\nRoss Sandler, Barclays.\nRoss Sandler\nMark, so on Monday in your interview with Jensen, you said something along the lines of if scaling ended up stopping one day, you'd have five years of product work to do and ahead of you. So outside of agents or AI assistants, what other areas in AI are you thinking about or looking at in that five-year road map?And then the second question is maybe one more stab at the capacity question. You guys said that Llama 3.1 was trained on 16,000 H100s. You've also said that you're going to have 600,000 available by year-end. So even if we kind of go up to 160,000 GPUs for Llama 4, we have plenty of extra capacity for inference and future products. How are you guys modeling out this entire kind of CapEx road map between training, inference, and future things? That's all.\nMark Zuckerberg\nI can start with the first one, and then I'll let Susan answer the second one. It's an interesting question. It's a little hypothetical because I mean, I do think it's true that if, let's say, there were no future foundation models. I think there would just be a huge amount of product innovation that the industry would bring to bear, and that just takes time. But then at the same time, there are going to be future foundation models and they're going to be awesome and unlock new capabilities and we're planning our products around those. So I'm not really planning our product roadmap assuming that there isn't future innovation.On the contrary, we are planning what's going to be in Llama 4 and Llama 5 and beyond based on what capabilities we think are going to be most important for the road map that I just laid out for having the breadth of utility that you're going to need in something like Meta AI, making it set businesses and creators and individuals can stand up any kind of AI agents that they want, that you're going to have these kind of real-time, multimodal glasses with you all the time that will just be increasingly useful for all the things that you're doing.I guess this kind of dovetails what I'd expect Susan to talk about next. And we do have this huge set of use cases already about people wanting to discover content and interact with their friends and businesses reaching people, and all that stuff is getting better with this, too. I guess my point there was it's just there's some lag between the technology becoming available and the products becoming kind of fully explored in the space. And I just think that that was kind of my way of saying that I think that this is just a very exciting area where there's just going to be a lot of innovation for a long time to come.I'll let Susan take a stab at the numbers around the GPUs and all that.\nSusan Li\nThank you. We are clearly in the process of building out a lot of capacity, and Mark has alluded to that in his comments about what we have needed to train prior generations and the next generation of Llama. And that's driving sort of what we've talked about in terms of the significant growth in CapEx in 2025. And we aren't really in the position now to share a longer-term outlook.When we think about sort of any given new data center project that we're constructing, we think about how we will use it over the life of the data center. We think about the amount of capacity we would use in terms of training whatever the subsequent generations of Llama are and architected around that. But then we also look at how we might use it several years into its lifetime towards other use cases across our core business, across what we think might be future needs for inference, for generative AI-based products.So there's sort of a whole host of use cases for the life of any individual data center ranging from gen AI training at its outset to potentially supporting gen AI inference to being used for core ads and content ranking and recommendation and also thinking through the implications, too, of what kinds of servers we might use to support those different types of use cases. So we are really mapping across a wide range of potential use cases when we undertake any given project.And we're really doing that with both a long time horizon in mind, again, because of the long lead times in spinning up data centers, but also recognizing that there are multiple decision points in the lifetime of each data center in terms of thinking through when to order servers and what servers to order and what you'll put them towards. And that gives us flexibility to make the sort of the best decisions based on the information we have in the future.\nKenneth Dorell\nGreat. Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.\n"

        "Text": "WhatsApp's massive 500 million users in India have supercharged Meta's AI ambitions.\nMeta CFO Susan Li said Wednesday that India is the largest market in terms of Meta AI usage, a notable milestone considering the product launched in India just a few months ago.\nLi said during Meta's second-quarter earnings call that people have used Meta AI for billions of queries since its launch.\n\"We're seeing particularly promising signs on WhatsApp in terms of retention and engagement, which has coincided with India becoming our largest market for Meta AI usage,\" she noted.\nMeta first launched Meta AI, which is present across Instagram, Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp and the web, in the United States last year. The company upgraded the chatbot in April with the new Llama 3 model and rolled it out in more than a dozen countries.\nWhile Meta started testing Meta AI in India around the same time, it wasn't available to all users until June, after India's general elections were completed.\nThe company has faced cultural challenges in making AI more attuned to the Indian market. In May, TechCrunch reported that Meta AI-generated images of Indian men predominantly with turbans. In July, several users on X complained that Meta AI generated jokes about one religion and declined to do the same for others. These results were inconsistent, and in the end Meta tweaked its algorithm to create a level playing field for religious jokes.\nLast month, the social giant introduced support for languages apart from English, including French, German, Hindi, Hindi-Romanized Script, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. Meta AI is now available in 22 countries, including the recent additions of Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico.\nZuckerberg also talked about needing 10 times the computing power to train the next Llama 4 model.\n\"The amount of computing needed to train Llama 4 will likely be almost 10 times more than what we used to train Llama 3, and future models will continue to grow beyond that,\" Zuckerberg said during the call.\nApart from AI, Meta saw promising signs for its social networks. The company noted that Threads now has \"almost\" 200 million users. Meta said last month that the Twitter/X rival had passed 175 million active users. Additionally, Zuckerberg mentioned that the company is seeing promising results of Facebook usage among young adults in the U.S.\nCorrection: The comments about India and Meta AI usage in the country was incorrectly attributed to Mark Zuckerberg. CFO Susan Li made those comments. \n"

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Facebook parent Meta (META) said on Wednesday that it has removed thousands of Instagram accounts linked to so-called sextortion scams.\nIn a blog post, the company detailed how it pulled 63,000 accounts, including a network of 2,500 accounts run by some 20 individuals, attempting to commit the financially motivated scams.\nAccording to Meta the accounts are affiliated with a group known as Yahoo Boys \u2014 no affiliation with this website \u2014 a loose collection of cybercriminals that largely operate out of Nigeria focusing on financial scams.\nThese scammers mostly targeted adult men in the US. But Meta said they also tried to target minors, leading the company to report the matter to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\nIn sextortion scams, the bad actors generally reach out to a massive number of users across social networks in the hopes of getting victims to respond \u2014 and strike up phony romantic relationships.\nOver the course of their correspondences, the scammers will request nude photos or videos of the victims, which they then say they will release to friends and family or the broader internet if the victim doesn\u2019t pay what can be hundreds of dollars in ransom.\nWhile Meta said its automated systems detected the majority of the scam accounts before they could do any damage, it used other investigative methods to find the remaining accounts and take them offline as well.\nAccording to Meta\u2019s global head of safety, Antigone Davis, the company is going public to help drive awareness of these types of scams. What\u2019s more, she said, Meta also wants criminals to know that they\u2019re picking up on these crimes and actively taking steps to block them.\nSextortion has become a growing threat in recent years, with the FBI warning about the crime in 2023 and again this year. In 2023, two Nigerian men suspected of running sextortion schemes that led to the suicide of a 17-year-old from Michigan were extradited to the US to face charges for the alleged crimes.\nIn March 2024, a third person was ordered to be extradited to the US by a Nigerian court, though he is challenging the move. The original suspects pleaded guilty in April.\nIn addition to the 63,000 Instagram accounts, Meta said it also took down 7,200 assets from Facebook, including 1,300 accounts, 200 pages, and 5,700 groups based in Nigeria dedicated to providing tips on scamming people \u2014 plus scripts to use on victims and photos to create fake accounts.\nBeyond removing the accounts, Meta says it is also providing features to help prevent users from falling for sextortion scams, including on-device nudity protection, which automatically blurs images containing nudity in Instagram direct messages.\nThere are a few ways users can recognize some of the signs of potential sextortion scammers. The most obvious is getting a message from someone you\u2019ve never spoken to before who seems to be trying to connect with you via direct messages without any prompting. Another sign is a message from someone including an image and asking for one in return.\nMeta says it also has technology that can determine if an account is exhibiting scammy or suspicious behavior and will notify users who interact with it that it may be a scam account.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Today\u2019s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks dives into the wave of selling that sent the Nasdaq tumbling to start the heart of big tech earnings season on Wednesday. The episode then explores Meta Platforms (META) and\u00a0Amazon (AMZN) stock before their upcoming earnings releases to see if investors should buy the top tech stocks before earnings or wait for more selling.\nTechnology stocks and other first-half standouts tanked on Wednesday, sending the Nasdaq below its 50-day moving average for only the second time in 2024.\u00a0\nThe selling came as the busy stretch of technology earnings kicked off after the closing bell on Tuesday, with Alphabet and Tesla.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nTech stocks and the market could experience more selling and volatility throughout earnings season, especially since big tech set the bar very high.\nThankfully, the tailwinds that sent the stock market soaring in the first half remain in place. Any near-term selling represents a healthy recalibration and an opportunity for investors to buy their favorite stocks at discounts. \nThe two stocks we explore today are tech giants and AI investments.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMeta (META), the owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, grew its daily active users by 7% in Q1 to 3.24 billion. Meta grew its ad impressions delivered across its family of apps by 20%. \nMeta stands to thrive in a world full of smartphone addicts. Meta is also investing heavily in its AI future. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s goal is for Meta to win the AI race by rolling out open source artificial intelligence.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta shares have soared roughly 400% off the market\u2019s 2022 lows to blow away Alphabet (GOOGL) and plenty of tech giants. The stock has also climbed 520% in the past 10 years vs. the Zacks Tech sector\u2019s 310%. \nThis context helps Meta\u2019s valuation look all the more impressive, with Meta trading at a 63% discount to its highs and 20% below the Zacks Tech sector at 22.4X forward 12-month earnings.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta stock has fallen 14% from its early July highs heading into its quarterly earnings release.

Meta trades at roughly neutral RSI levels on a 10-year timeframe after hitting its most overbought levels of the last decade earlier this year.\nMeta\u2019s recent cooldown makes the stock a potentially more appealing long-term buy-and-hold candidate for investors who can weather near-term volatility. It is worth remembering that Meta has a robust balance sheet and began paying a dividend earlier this year as it focuses on efficiency and profits.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAmazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy took over roughly three years ago with a mission to boost the bottom line while honing in on expansion in key growth areas. \nAmazon remains the king of e-commerce and its advertising unit is booming.

        "Author": "  KELVIN CHAN ",
        "Text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Meta's policies on non-consensual deepfake images need updating, including wording that\u2019s \u201cnot sufficiently clear,\" the company's oversight panel said Thursday in a decision on cases involving AI-generated explicit depictions of two famous women.\nThe quasi-independent Oversight Board said in one of the cases, the social media giant failed to take down the deepfake intimate image of a famous Indian woman, whom it didn't identify, until the company's review board got involved.\nDeepake nude images of women and celebrities including Taylor Swift have proliferated on social media because the technology used to make them has become more accessible and easier to use. Online platforms have been facing pressure to do more to tackle the problem.\nThe board, which Meta set up in 2020 to serve as a referee for content on its platforms including Facebook and Instagram, has spent months reviewing the two cases involving AI-generated images depicting famous women, one Indian and one American. The board did not identify either woman, describing each only as a \u201cfemale public figure.\u201d\nMeta said it welcomed the board's recommendations and is reviewing them.\nOne case involved an \"AI-manipulated image\" posted on Instagram depicting a nude Indian woman shown from the back with her face visible, resembling a \u201cfemale public figure.\u201d The board said a user reported the image as pornography but the report wasn't reviewed within a 48 hour deadline so it was automatically closed. The user filed an appeal to Meta, but that was also automatically closed.\nIt wasn't until the user appealed to the Oversight Board that Meta decided that its original decision not to take the post down was made in error.\nMeta also disabled the account that posted the images and added them to a database used to automatically detect and remove images that violate its rules.\nIn the second case, an AI-generated image depicting the American women nude and being groped were posted to a Facebook group. They were automatically removed because they were already in the database. A user appealed the takedown to the board, but it upheld Meta's decision.\nThe board said both images violated Meta\u2019s ban on \u201cderogatory sexualized photoshop\u201d under its bullying and harassment policy.\nHowever it added that its policy wording wasn't clear to users and recommended replacing the word \u201cderogatory\u201d with a different term like \u201cnon-consensual\u201d and specifying that the rule covers a broad range of editing and media manipulation techniques that go beyond \u201cphotoshop.\u201d\nDeepfake nude images should also fall under community standards on \u201cadult sexual exploitation\u201d instead of \u201cbullying and harassment,\u201d it said.\nWhen the board questioned Meta about why the Indian woman was not already in its image database, it was alarmed by the company's response that it relied on media reports.\n\u201cThis is worrying because many victims of deepfake intimate images are not in the public eye and are forced to either accept the spread of their non-consensual depictions or search for and report every instance,\" the board said.\nThe board also said it was concerned about Meta's \"auto-closing\" of appeals image-based sexual abuse after 48 hours, saying it \u201ccould have a significant human rights impact.\u201d\nMeta, then called Facebook, launched the Oversight Board in 2020 in response to criticism that it wasn\u2019t moving fast enough to remove misinformation, hate speech and influence campaigns from its platforms. The board has 21 members, a multinational group that includes legal scholars, human rights experts and journalists.\n"

The Meta AI chatbot powered by those models was on track to become the most popular AI assistant by the end of this year, with hundreds of millions of people using it already, he said.\nThe release comes as tech companies are racing to show that their growing portfolios of resource-hungry large language models can deliver significant enough gains in known problem areas like advanced reasoning to justify the gargantuan sums that have been invested in them.\nMeta's own top AI scientist has said he believes such models will hit up against limits on reasoning and that other types of AI systems will be needed to produce breakthroughs.\nIn addition to its flagship 405 billion parameter model, Meta is also releasing updated versions of its lighter-weight 8 billion and 70 billion parameter Llama 3 models initially introduced in the spring, the company said.\nAll three new models are multilingual and can handle larger user requests via an expanded \"context window,\" which Meta's head of generative AI, Ahmad Al-Dahle, said would improve the experience of generating computer code in particular.\n\"That was the number one feedback we got from the community,\" Al-Dahle told Reuters in an interview, noting that bigger context windows give the models something akin to a longer memory that aids in processing multi-step requests.\nSeparately, Al-Dahle said his team had been able to improve the Llama 3 model's performance on tasks such as solving math problems by using AI to generate some of the data on which they were trained.\nMeta releases its Llama models largely free-of-charge for use by developers, a strategy Zuckerberg says will pay off in the form of innovative products, less dependence on would-be competitors and greater engagement on the company's core social networks. Some investors have raised their eyebrows at the costs entailed, however.\nThe company also stands to benefit if developers opt to use its free models over paid ones, which would undercut the business models of its rivals. With its announcement, Meta touted gains on key math and knowledge tests that may make that prospect more appealing.\nAlthough measuring progress on AI development is notoriously difficult, test results provided by Meta appeared to suggest that its largest Llama 3 model was nearly matching and in some cases besting Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI's GPT-4o, which are widely regarded as the two most powerful frontier models on the market.\nOn the MATH benchmark of competition level math word problems, for example, Meta's model posted a score of 73.8, compared to GPT-4o's 76.6 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet's 71.1.\nThe model scored 88.6 on MMLU, a benchmark that covers dozens of subjects across math, science and the humanities, while GPT-4o scored 88.7 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored 88.3.\nIn their paper, Meta researchers also teased upcoming \"multimodal\" versions of the models due out later this year that layer image, video and speech capabilities on top of the core Llama 3 text model.\nEarly experiments indicate those models can perform \"competitively\" with other multimodal models such as Google's Gemini 1.5 and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, they said.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Louise Heavens and Daniel Wallis)\n"

        "Text": "By Elisha Bala-Gbogbo and and MacDonald Dzirutwe\nABUJA (Reuters) -Nigeria fined Meta Platforms $220 million, its competition watchdog said on Friday, after investigations showed data-sharing on social platforms violated local consumer, data protection and privacy laws.\nNigeria's Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) said Meta appropriated the data of Nigerian users on its platforms without their consent, abused its market dominance by forcing exploitative privacy policies on users, and meted out discriminatory and disparate treatment on Nigerians, compared with other jurisdictions with similar regulations.\nMeta did not immediately comment, but the FCCPC said in a statement that the company had provided some documents and have retained counsels who have met and engaged with the agency.\nFCCPC chief Adamu Abdullahi said the investigations were jointly held with Nigeria's Data Protection Commission and spanned over 38 months.\nThe investigations found Meta policies don't allow users the option or opportunity to self-determine or withhold consent to the gathering, use, and sharing of personal data, Abdullahi said.\n\"The totality of the investigation has concluded that Meta over the protracted period of time has engaged in conduct that constituted multiple and repeated, as well as continuing infringements... particularly, but not limited to abusive, and invasive practices against data subjects in Nigeria,\" Abdullahi said.\n\"Being satisfied with the significant evidence on the record, and that Meta has been provided every opportunity to articulate any position, representations, refutations, explanations or defences of their conduct, the Commission have now entered a final order and issued a penalty against Meta,\" Abdullahi said.\nThe final order mandates steps and actions Meta must take to comply with local laws, Abdullahi said.\nIn May, Turkey's competition board fined Meta 1.2 billion lira following investigations on data-sharing on its Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp platforms.\nMeta has faced pushback in Europe and other jurisdictions over alleged breaches of data protection laws. Meta's plan to use personal data to train its artificial intelligence models without seeking consent has come under fire in Europe.\nMeanwhile, South Africa's competition watchdog have announced plans to investigate whether digital platforms, including Meta unfairly compete with news publishers by using their content to generate ad revenue.\n(Editing by Louise Heavens and Rod Nickel)\n"

        "Text": "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has ceased using its AI assistant following a ban by Brazil\u2019s National Data Protection Authority (ANPD), which prohibits the company from training its AI models using personal data from Brazilian citizens.\nThe development is a setback for Meta's ambitions to expand its AI offerings in Brazil, a significant market with a populace exceeding 200 million.\n\u201cWe decided to suspend generative AI features that were previously live in Brazil while we engage with the ANPD to address their questions around generative AI,\u201d Meta spokesperson wrote in a statement to TechCrunch.\nIn June 2024, Meta had introduced an AI-based ad targeting feature for businesses on its widely used messaging service during an event in Sao Paulo.\nSoon after the launch of the ad programme the ANPD mandated an immediate halt to the enforcement of Meta's revised privacy policy concerning the use of personal data for training generative AI systems within the nation.\nThe ANPD's decision necessitates Meta to modify its privacy policy to remove provisions related to the processing of personal data for AI training purposes.\nThe ANPD's preventative action stems from \u201cthe imminent risk of serious harm and irreparable or difficult-to-repair damage to the fundamental rights of guardians\u201d, as stated in the official documentation.\nFurthermore, the ANPD has imposed a daily fine of 50,000 reais ($9000) should a company fail to comply with the ruling.\nWhile Meta has been utilising user-generated content to train its AI in the US and other regions for several years, it encountered a similar obstacle in May when it had to pause its AI training initiatives in Europe and the UK due to objections from the Irish Data Protection Commission.\n\"Meta halts AI assistant amid Brazil data privacy ruling \" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Title": "Better Adtech Stock to buy in the Second Half of 2024: Meta Platforms vs. Alphabet",
        "Author": "  Jake Lerch, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The first half of 2024 is in the books, and it's been a solid period for the stock market. The S&P 500 is up more than 14% year to date, while the Nasdaq Composite is up more than 18%.\nDigital advertising has been one of the year's top-performing sectors. Today, let's examine two titans of the industry -- Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) -- and see which is the better choice for investors heading into the second half of 2024.\nAs the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, Meta Platforms is a social media giant. With more than 3 billion monthly active users (MAUs) across its various platforms, the company's reach is truly staggering. What's more, Meta's MAU figures have seen a 7% increase year-over-year, a clear sign of its expanding reach and potential for the future.\nMeta Platforms, with its massive user base, is a significant player in the digital ad sales market. In its latest quarter, the company's revenue stood at $36.5 billion, with a staggering 98% coming from ad sales. The company's 20% increase in overall ad impressions is a clear indicator of its strong growth trajectory.\nMeta's great rival in the digital advertising sector is Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube. Alphabet relies on its signature Google Search offering for most of its appeal with advertisers.\nIn the first quarter, Google Search generated $46.2 billion in revenue -- 57% of the company's total revenue. YouTube ads contributed a further $8.1 billion, or 10% of overall revenue. An additional $7.4 billion, or 9% of its total, came from ads placed on the company's Google display network.\nIn total, Alphabet generated $61.7 billion, or 77%, of its quarterly revenue from advertising. So Alphabet, in comparison to Meta, has a more diversified revenue base. This, coupled with its larger size, makes Alphabet a smart choice for investors who are seeking stability rather than a \"pure play\" on the digital ad market.\nWithout a doubt, both companies remain solid investment choices. Each controls a major percentage of the $740 billion digital ad market, which some analysts expect to reach $1 trillion annually by 2030. Nevertheless, there are differences to consider -- among them, how much value each stock creates for its shareholders. \nOn that front, Meta seems like a clear winner. Over the last two years, Meta has increased its free cash flow per share by more than 96%, while Alphabet's has grown by about 14%.\nMETA Free Cash Flow Per Share data by YCharts.\nThat's important because free cash flow is one of the best indicators of how much value a company is generating for its shareholders. For example, free cash flow can be used to fund dividend payments or share buybacks, pay down debt, or support acquisitions.\nTherefore, Meta Platforms edges out Alphabet as my pick for the top adtech stock for the second half of 2024 -- and beyond.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Possible Bearish Signals With Meta Platforms Insiders Disposing Stock",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Many Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n View our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nThe Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$473 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$535). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 9.3% of Andrew Bosworth's stake.\nInsiders in Meta Platforms didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: Most of them are flying under the radar).\nThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Meta Platforms shares. Specifically, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth ditched US$2.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Meta Platforms insiders own 14% of the company, worth about US$184b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\nAn insider sold Meta Platforms shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But since Meta Platforms is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Meta Platforms. For example - Meta Platforms has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.\nIf you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Microsoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+13.4% vs. +11.1%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.\u00a0Productivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth.\u00a0However, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern. \nThe market also appears to be starting to get concerned about the ever-rising trend in AI-focused capital spending without a lot of visiblity and discussion on the part of management with respect to outlay's ROI, as we saw with the Alphabet earnings release. It will be interesting if the coming Microsoft quarterly release will produce a comparable reaction or something different.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+31.5% vs. +6.2%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.Meta Platforms is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram. Threads have more than 175 million monthly actives.\u00a0Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern, an issue that we also we encountered with Alphabet recently. It will be interesting to see how the market will react to the latest capex numbers from Meta.(You can read the full research report on Meta here >>>)JPMorgan Chase\u2019s shares have outperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past year (+33.5% vs. +30.4%). The company\u2019s second-quarter 2024 results show a rebound in investment banking (IB) business. High rates, buyouts, opening branches and solid loan balance will aid net interest income (NII), though higher funding costs will weigh on it.\u00a0According to the Zacks analyst estimates for NII (managed) and loans imply a CAGR of 1.8% and 3.8%, respectively, by 2026. While there has been a resurgence in deal-making activities, a complete revival will still take some time. So, the performance of the IB business is not expected to improve much.The volatile nature of the capital markets business and high mortgage rates will likely hurt fee income growth. Owing to these challenges, we expect non-interest income (managed) to rise in 2024 but decline next year. Mounting costs will hurt profits, and we expect it to rise 5.4% in 2024.(You can read the full research report on JPMorgan Chase here >>>)Shares of Applied Energetics have underperformed the Zacks Lasers Systems and Components industry over the past year (-44.5% vs. -34.5%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $269.19 million reported a sharp revenue decline in first-quarter 2024 due to contract modifications, increasing operating expenses and declining cash reserves.\u00a0Additionally, its reliance on government contracts and competition from established defense contractors, coupled with deficiencies in financial reporting controls, present significant challenges.\u00a0Nevertheless, Applied Energetics expanded operations at the University of Arizona Tech Park, establishing a new Battle Lab, and increasing laser manufacturing capacity to support technology maturation and customer demonstrations. With 25 patents and more than $50 million invested in intellectual property, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing directed energy weapons and counter-UAS markets. Recent contracts with the USMC, Army and Navy validate AERG\u2019s technology.(You can read the full research report on Applied Energetics here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms and Walmart: 2 Blue-Chip Stocks Hitting a \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 Score",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "There are as many paths to market success as there are market investors, but one that stands out is following the blue-chip stocks. These market stalwarts, well-known companies with long records of profitable success and stability, let investors tap into the advantages of the \u2018known knowns,\u2019 the reliability that gives us confidence in strong future performance.\nBut even knowing what we know, it\u2019s still good to find confirmation from the data. The Smart Score tool, an AI-based, natural language algorithm, gathers, collates, and analyzes the reams of raw information put up by millions of daily stock transactions \u2013 and distills it down to a single-digit score that\u2019s easy to understand and use.\nThe Smart Score is given on a simple scale of 1 to 10, with a \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 being a stock that measures up according to a set of factors known to predict future outperformance. These are the stocks that are worth some extra attention \u2013 and when those stocks are also blue-chip leaders like Meta Platforms or Walmart, companies that have brought long-term gains and profits, it\u2019s a clear and bullish signal for investors to follow.\nSo let\u2019s do that. Using the TipRanks platform, we\u2019ve pulled up the latest data on those two blue-chip \u2018Perfect 10s,\u2019 Meta and Walmart. Here they are, along with comments from the Street\u2019s analysts\nMeta Platforms (META)\nUp first is Meta Platforms, originally founded as Facebook \u2013 the company that set off the social media storm in the early 2000s. In its current incarnation, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s creation has become a holding company, operating in the social media realm through its subsidiaries: Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meta operates globally, reaching out across linguistic and geographic barriers. The company has a total user base, across all of its platforms, well in excess of 3 billion people.\nMeta\u2019s core business is social media, monetized through digital advertising. This business model depends on reach, and the company\u2019s unmatched success in that metric \u2013 its platforms connect with some 40% of the world\u2019s total population \u2013 provides a solid base for profitable operations. In 1Q24, the last reported, Meta saw a top line of $36.46 billion, a figure that was up 27% year-over-year and beat the forecast by $240 million. At its bottom line, Meta generated earnings of $4.71 per share, 39 cents per share better than had been anticipated.\nIt\u2019s important to note that Meta finished Q1 with those successes even as it paid out capital expenditures of $6.72 billion. The company reported a free cash flow in the quarter of $12.53 billion, and had $58.12 billion in cash and other liquid assets on hand.\nLike all successful companies, Meta has been adapting itself to changing conditions. The company\u2019s Meta AI research lab is working on several AI applications simultaneously, including apps for creative and connection AIs \u2013 and most importantly, a generative AI user interface. The company is working to develop a seamless transition from the real-life and AI universes, with scalable AI systems operable at any level the user chooses.\nTurning to the analysts, we find that Deepak Mathivanan, from Wolfe Research, is staking out a strongly upbeat position in his initiation of coverage. He notes the company\u2019s increasing capital expenditure, particularly on AI, and explains that it has potential to pay back for investors, writing, \u201cWe believe that META\u2019s expected uptick in OpEx and CapEx is warranted to solidify a leading position in the Gen AI arms race vs. other Mega cap names and that the company should see benefits to top-line growth from Gen AI product flow-through as well as the ability to exercise cost discipline in order to continue expanding margins over the next two years.\u201d\nLooking ahead, Mathivanan adds, \u201cWe agree with the Bulls that META can continue to grow top-line (although not accelerate through the year) and gain share, supported by Gen AI initiatives, Reels monetization, and rising contribution of click-to-messaging. We see upward estimates revision to be more likely of a driver than multiple expansion for the stock to work near-to-mid-term.\u201d\nThese comments, taken together, back up the analyst\u2019s Outperform (Buy) rating on META shares, while his $620 price target points toward a one-year upside potential of 34.5%. (To watch Mathivanan\u2019s track record, click here.)\nOverall, this Magnificent 7 mega-cap stock has earned a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street\u2019s analysts, based on 44 reviews that include 39 Buys, 3 Holds, and 2 Sells. The shares are trading for $461.27 and their $539.59 average target price implies an upside of 17% on the one-year horizon. (See Meta\u2019s stock forecast.)\nWalmart, Inc. (WMT)\nNext on our list here is Walmart, known as the world\u2019s largest brick-and-mortar retailer \u2013 and the second largest of all types, after Amazon. Walmart company has long billed itself as an American success story, growing from its roots as a Mom-and-Pop store in Arkansas to become a global giant with a $568 billion market cap and $648 billion in total revenues for its fiscal year 2024, which ended this past January 31. Walmart employs over 2 million people worldwide and is the clear leader in the discount retail segment in the US.\nIn addition to its eponymous stores \u2013 focusing on the discount department store and grocery niches, Walmart also owns and operates the Sam\u2019s Club chain of warehouse membership stores. The company operates more than 10,500 locations in 19 countries, including 4,609 Walmart superstores and 599 Sam\u2019s Club stores in the US and another 5,399 Walmart locations internationally.\nIn addition to its brick-and-mortar presence, the company has a strong global eCommerce component, that showed 21% year-over-year growth in the last quarter reported, fiscal 1Q25. Walmart has pursued an interesting variation on eCommerce, leveraging its brick-and-mortar network: customers can pay and order online, and pick up their merchandise at the nearest Walmart store.\nDuring that quarter, Walmart registered $161.5 billion in consolidated revenues, for year-over-year growth of 6% and beating the estimates by $3.36 billion. The company\u2019s earnings, reported as a non-GAAP EPS of $0.60, were 8 cents per share better than the forecast. We should note here that shares in WMT are up 35% for the year-to-date, strongly outpacing the ~14% gain on the S&P 500.\nAnalyst Peter Keith, of Piper Sandler, agrees with the upbeat sentiment towards Walmart. He points out the stock\u2019s strong year so far, as well as the company\u2019s potential to continue bringing in solid returns: \u201cWhile WMT shares have had a terrific run YTD, we believe the company is in the early stages of an unprecedented profit growth acceleration for a large and mature retailer. By leveraging its massive omni-channel model, WMT is driving significant valuation creation in the form of new and high-margin revenue streams (e.g., Supplier Advertising, E-com Marketplace, etc.) that should not only accelerate EBIT growth in the years to come, but will also create a steadier and more sustainable growth model, in our view.\u201d\nThis position leads the 5-star analyst to rate WMT shares as Overweight (Buy) and to set an $81 price target that suggests an upside of almost 15% for the coming year. (To watch Keith\u2019s track record, click here.)\nThere are 30 recent analyst reviews of Walmart\u2019s stock, and the 27 to 3 breakdown, favoring Buy over Hold, gives the shares a Strong Buy consensus rating. WMT shares are selling for $70.6, and the $74.11 average target price implies they will gain 5% over the next 12 months. (See Walmart\u2019s stock forecast.)\nTo find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019\u00a0Best Stocks to Buy, a tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

        "Text": "(Reuters) -Meta Platforms is in talks to acquire a stake of about 5% in EssilorLuxottica, its production partner for Ray-Ban smart glasses, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.\nThe stake in the world's largest eyewear company could be worth 4.33 billion euros ($4.73 billion) based on its latest market value of 86.50 billion euros, according to Reuters calculations based on LSEG data.\nThe potential deal could give Meta further control over the roadmap for the smart glasses at a time when tech giants including Apple are investing millions to create cutting-edge gadgets based on augmented- and mixed-reality technologies.\nEssilorLuxottica's Paris-listed shares were up 3% after the report, while Meta gained 1.2%.\nThe eyewear company was formed in 2018 through a merger of France's Essilor and Italy's Luxottica.

A spokesperson for EssilorLuxottica declined to comment. The Financial Times reported the talks earlier.\nMeta has already received clearance from US antitrust authorities to buy a minority stake of as much as 5%, according to two people familiar with the deal. The US Federal Trade Commission declined to comment.\nBy taking a stake in EssilorLuxottica, the social media giant would deepen its partnership with the world\u2019s biggest eyewear company. It would also presumably gain more influence over a business that\u2019s key to its virtual and augmented reality efforts and strengthen its position against rivals. Snap Inc. has been experimenting with mixed-reality spectacles for years while Apple Inc. released the Vision Pro headset earlier this year.\nAs yet, consumers haven\u2019t adopted these technologies en masse.\nEssilorLuxottica shares were up 2.3% at \u20ac194.20 at 11:11 a.m. New York time. Meta gained 1.1% to $467.27.\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first company that Meta has taken a stake in. Four years ago, the social-media giant announced that it would buy about 10% of Reliance Industries Ltd.\u2019s Jio Platforms, becoming its largest minority shareholder with a $5.7 billion investment. That partnership came as Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg was working to step up his expansion in India, where online payment and e-commerce demand was exploding as more people used smartphones.\nMeta has heavily invested in the metaverse \u2014 a future version of the internet made up of immersive worlds accessible via headsets \u2014 which Zuckerberg has hailed as the next major computing revolution after mobile phones. The company changed its name from Facebook to Meta years ago to underscore the dedication to the concept.\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says:\nMeta is likely doubling down on its AR and smart-glasses bet with its new new stake in EssilorLuxottica, given it doesn\u2019t own the hardware platform as is the case with Oculus VR. We believe AR units, about 10-15x smaller than VR in terms of units shipped, could grow at a much faster rate than VR given the potential to have smart glasses as an inference device for gen-AI and virtual-assistant functionality.\n\u2014 Mandeep Singh and Nishant Chintala, Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Tech Analysts\nMeta unveiled its first Ray-Ban smart glasses in partnership with EssilorLuxottica in 2021. Those glasses were set on the Wayfarer frame to let users take photos and videos, listen to music and answer calls. Newer glasses incorporate MetaAI, an AI assistant based on its Llama artificial intelligence model.\nEssilorLuxottica on Wednesday announced an agreement to buy streetwear label Supreme from VF Corp. for $1.5 billion in cash, adding another lifestyle brand to a stable that also includes Oakley sunglasses.\n--With assistance from Shona Ghosh, Daniel Zuidijk and Antonio Vanuzzo.\n(Updates with US approval in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe $12,000 Harvard Class Celebrities Are Fighting to Get Into\nAirbnb Hosts Want Guests to Come to Them Directly\nThe Real Reason Erewhon Is a Cult Brand\nWhy Is the US Deficit So Big?

        "Title": "A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The projected fair value for Meta Platforms is US$577 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nWith US$499 share price, Meta Platforms appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\nOur fair value estimate is 9.4% higher than Meta Platforms' analyst price target of US$528\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$51.9b\nUS$57.5b\nUS$66.7b\nUS$72.5b\nUS$76.9b\nUS$80.8b\nUS$84.2b\nUS$87.3b\nUS$90.1b\nUS$92.8b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x19\nAnalyst x9\nAnalyst x4\nAnalyst x3\nEst @ 6.11%\nEst @ 4.99%\nEst @ 4.21%\nEst @ 3.66%\nEst @ 3.27%\nEst @ 3.01%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% \nUS$48.3k\nUS$49.9k\nUS$54.0k\nUS$54.7k\nUS$54.1k\nUS$52.9k\nUS$51.4k\nUS$49.7k\nUS$47.8k\nUS$45.9k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$509b\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$93b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.4%) = US$1.9t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.9t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$955b\nThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$1.5t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$499, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Meta Platforms as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.069. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

        "Title": "Meta takes down thousands of Facebook, Instagram accounts running sextortion scams from Nigeria",
        "Author": "  BARBARA ORTUTAY ",
        "Text": "Meta said Wednesday that it has taken down about 63,000 Instagram accounts in Nigeria running sexual extortion scams and has removed thousands of Facebook groups and pages that were trying to organize, recruit and train new scammers.\nSexual extortion, or sextortion, involves persuading a person to send explicit photos online and then threatening to make the images public unless the victim pays money or engages in sexual favors. Recent high-profile cases include two Nigerian brothers who pleaded guilty to sexually extorting teen boys and young men in Michigan, including one who took his own life, and a Virginia sheriff\u2019s deputy who sexually extorted and kidnapped a 15-year-old girl.\nThere has been a marked rise in sextortion cases in recent years, fueled in part by a loosely organized group called the Yahoo Boys, operating mainly out of Nigeria, Meta said. It added that it applied its \u201cdangerous organizations and individuals\u201d policy to remove Facebook accounts and groups run by the group.\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re driven by money, they\u2019re targeting can be indiscriminate,\" said Antigone Davis, Meta's global head of safety. \u201cSo in other words, think of this as a little bit of a scattershot approach: get out there and send many, many, requests out to individuals and see who may who may respond.\u201d\nIn January, the FBI warned of a \u201chuge increase\u201d in sextortion cases targeting children. The targeted victims are primarily boys between the ages of 14 to 17, but the FBI said any child can become a victim.\nMeta said its investigation found that the majority of the scammers' attempts did not succeed and mostly targeted adult men in the U.S., but added that it did see \u201csome\u201d try to target minors, which Meta says it reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\nThe removed accounts included a \u201ccoordinated network\u201d of about 2,500 accounts linked to a group of about 20 people who were running them, Meta said.\nIn April, Meta announced it was deploying new tools in Instagram to protect young people and combat sexual extortion, including a feature that will automatically blur nudity in direct messages. Meta is still testing out the features as part of its campaign to fight sexual scams and other forms of \u201cimage abuse,\u201d and to make it tougher for criminals to contact teens.\nDavis said users should look out for messages from people with \u201chighly stylized\" photos, people who are \u201cexceptionally good looking\u201d or have never sent you a message before.\n\u201cThat should give you pause,\u201d she said. Users should also take a pause if somebody sends an image first \u2014 scammers often use this tactic to try to gain trust and bait unsuspecting people into sending them back a photo of themselves.\n\u201cThis is one of the one of these areas where if you have any sort of suspicion, I would urge caution,\u201d she said.\n"

The effect of the ratio change on the ADS trading price on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") is expected to take place at the open of trading on July 29, 2024 (U.S. Eastern Time). ADS holders of record on the effective date will need to surrender their ADS to the depositary bank for cancellation and exchange in connection with the ADS ratio change, with further details to be provided in the notice by the depositary bank.

Instead, fractional entitlements to new ADSs will be aggregated and sold by the depositary bank and the net cash proceeds from the sale of the fractional ADS entitlements (after deduction of fees, taxes and expenses) will be distributed to the applicable ADS holders by the depositary bank.\nAs a result of the change in the ADS ratio, the ADS price is expected to increase proportionally, although the Company can give no assurance that the ADS price after the change in the ADS ratio will be equal to or greater than the ADS price on a proportionate basis.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements made under the \"safe harbor\" provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. reported better-than-expected sales in the second quarter on Wednesday, signaling that the company\u2019s investments in artificial intelligence are helping it sell more targeted ads.

Has It Worked?\nWhat a Beautiful Bus Stop Can Do\nThat progress is buying Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg more time to prove that his bets on the metaverse and AI are worth their while. In a call with investors and analysts on Wednesday, he expounded on Meta\u2019s push into the type of large language models that power AI chatbots and praised the company\u2019s AI smart glasses and virtual reality headsets.\n\u201cThere are all the jokes about how all the tech CEOs get on these earnings calls and just talk about AI the whole time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s actually super exciting and it\u2019s going to change all these different things over multiple time horizons.\u201d\nMeta has been using AI to improve the way its advertisers can find interested users, adding efficiency to its most lucrative business. More specifically, the company is using algorithms to better determine when and where to show ads. It\u2019s also starting to roll out generative AI features so that marketers with small budgets can create more interesting promotions.\nAI will \u201cend up affecting almost every product that we have in some way,\u201d he said.\nMeta had 3.27 billion users across all of its apps as of June 30, up 7% from a year earlier. The company\u2019s shares jumped as much as 10% after trading opened in New York on Thursday, adding $123 billion in market value. This is the stock\u2019s biggest intraday gain since February.\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent company reported sales of $39.1 billion for the quarter ended June 30, compared with analysts\u2019 estimates of $38.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Meta expects sales for the current quarter of $38.5 billion to $41 billion, compared with the average projection for $39.2 billion.\nMeta has been spending heavily on data centers and computing power as Zuckerberg works to build a leading position in the industry-wide AI race. The company tweaked its full-year projections for capital expenditures, setting a new forecast of $37 billion to $40 billion, raising the low end of an earlier range by $2 billion.\nMeta recently unveiled its largest model to date, which Zuckerberg said cost hundreds of millions of dollars in computing power to train. The company has also spent heavily on other long-term projects, including AI-powered smartglasses and a series of virtual worlds known as the metaverse. Reality Labs, the division within Meta tasked with building these futuristic technologies, reported a loss of nearly $4.5 billion on the quarter.\nBalancing investment with the more immediate need for financial returns has been a challenge at times for Meta. Zuckerberg has made moves to support Meta\u2019s stock performance \u2014 including job cuts, a $50 billion share buyback program and Meta\u2019s first-ever quarterly dividend \u2014 while remaining clear that the company\u2019s spending will continue to rise. The company said in a release Wednesday that it plans to increase capital expenditures \u201csignificantly\u201d as it invests in AI research and product development.\nThere are some early signs that the AI-focused products are gaining popularity, though not necessarily contributing to the company\u2019s bottom line. Zuckerberg said that the Meta AI chatbot is on pace to become the most widely used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.

        "Text": "Meta Platforms chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, whose company runs Llama, the world's largest open-source large language model (LLM), said artificial intelligence based on open-source technology will help the US maintain a lead over China.\n\"Some people argue that we must close our models to prevent China from gaining access to them, but my view is that this will not work and will only disadvantage the US and its allies,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post published on July 23, advocating for open source AI and announcing its own open source model Llama 3.1.\nHaving only closed models will result in a world where leading models can only be accessed by a handful of large companies and the US' geopolitical adversaries, who are \"great at espionage\", the Facebook founder argued. \"Stealing models that fit on a thumb drive is relatively easy, and most tech companies are far from operating in a way that would make this more difficult.\"\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nThe Meta chief's comments come amid a fierce AI race between China and the US. Driven by national security concerns, Washington has intensified measures preventing China's access to advanced chips and curbing American investment in Chinese AI projects. In response, Beijing has urged domestic firms to build the country's own models independent of foreign technology.\nMany Chinese developers still rely on Meta's Llama models.

Photo: Shutterstock Images>\nMany Chinese tech firms still rely on US AI models, including closed versions such as OpenAI's suite of GPT models, and Meta's open source Llama.\nOpenAI, which sparked the generative AI craze with the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, last month said it would take additional measures to block access to its AI models via application programming interfaces (APIs) from unsupported regions, including mainland China and Hong Kong.\nSome Chinese developers have scrambled to keep access to OpenAI models, by using virtual private networks and third-party services.\nMany Chinese developers have also been relying on Meta's Llama models, an indication of the hurdles local companies face in trying to reach self-sufficiency, according to the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence.\nStill, Zuckerberg argues that open sourcing AI models will help the US maintain its advantage.\n\"There's one strain of thought, which is like, we need to lock it all down, and I just happen to think that's really wrong because the US thrives on open and decentralised innovation,\" Zuckerberg said in a video interview with Bloomberg published on Thursday. \"That's the way our economy works. That's how we build awesome stuff.\"\nBut to preserve its lead, Washington should still work with leading American companies to make sure that the US has a \"perpetual first mover advantage\" on leading technologies for the purpose of national defence, Zuckerberg said in the interview.\nThe US should aim to maintain a six-to-eight-month lead over China, he added, arguing that it is an unreasonable goal to try and be five to 10 years ahead of its main rival.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Author": "  NADIA LATHAN ",
        "Text": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Meta has agreed to a $1.4 billion settlement with Texas in a privacy lawsuit over allegations that the tech giant used biometric data of users without their permission, officials said Tuesday.\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the settlement is the largest secured by a single state. In 2021, a judge approved a $650 million settlement with the company, formerly known as Facebook, over similar allegations of users in Illinois.\n\u201cThis historic settlement demonstrates our commitment to standing up to the world\u2019s biggest technology companies and holding them accountable for breaking the law and violating Texans\u2019 privacy rights,\u201d Paxton, a Republican, said in a statement.\nMeta said in a statement: \u201cWe are pleased to resolve this matter, and look forward to exploring future opportunities to deepen our business investments in Texas, including potentially developing data centers.\u201d\nFiled in 2022, the Texas lawsuit said that Meta was in violation of a state law that prohibits capturing or selling a resident's biometric information, such as their face or fingerprint, without their consent.\n\u201cThis is by far the biggest state governmental privacy settlement in history,\u201d Chicago-based class action attorney Jay Edelson said in an email. Edelson's firm filed the lawsuit that settled for $650 million with Meta. The only other larger claim is the Federal Trade Commission's $5 billion settlement with the company in 2019.\nTo date, Meta has now paid over $2 billion in settlements for biometric privacy claims, according to Edelson. \u201cThat is a huge signal to other companies that they should be extremely careful if they want to trade in individuals' biometric information,\u201d he said.\nThe company announced in 2021 that it was shutting down its face-recognition system and delete the faceprints of more than 1 billion people amid growing concerns about the technology and its misuse by governments, police and others.\nAt the time, more than a third of Facebook\u2019s daily active users had opted in to have their faces recognized by the social network\u2019s system. Facebook introduced facial recognition more than a decade earlier but gradually made it easier to opt out of the feature as it faced scrutiny from courts and regulators.\nFacebook in 2019 stopped automatically recognizing people in photos and suggesting people \u201ctag\u201d them, and instead of making that the default, asked users to choose if they wanted to use its facial recognition feature.\nTexas filed a similar lawsuit against Google in 2022. Paxton\u2019s lawsuit says the search giant collected millions of biometric identifiers, including voiceprints and records of face geometry, through its products and services like Google Photos, Google Assistant, and Nest Hub Max. That lawsuit is still pending.\nThe $1.4 billion is unlikely to make a dent in Meta\u2019s business. The Menlo Park, California-based tech made a profit of $12.37 billion in the first three months of this year, Its revenue was $36.46 billion, an increase of 27% from a year earlier. Meta is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings results on Wednesday.\nMeta\u2019s stock slipped $4.06 to $461.65 Tuesday, a decline of less than 1%.\n___\nAP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay in San Francisco contributed to this report.\n___\nLathan is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

His thoughts on economy and stock valuations are given a lot of weight by analysts. Damodaran in his recent interview with CNBC said that Magnificent Seven stocks have become the \u201cvalue stocks for investors who care about earnings and cash flows.\u201d\n\u201cWe look at the last year and a half, they\u2019ve added $8.8 trillion in market cap\u2026 just these seven companies. Just to give you perspective, the second-largest market in the world, China, has a market cap of $12.1 trillion. These seven stocks alone have added more in market cap than the entire German market, the French market, the Swiss market.\u201d\nDamodaran\u2019s comments are important because he\u2019s been repeatedly saying in the past that major technology companies are fully or overvalued. In September, he said on CNBC that if you go through the list of top tech stocks, \u201cyou are more likely to be overvalued than undervalued.\u201d\nBut in his latest interview, Damodaran said that before we \u201cdismiss\u201d Mag. 7 stocks as \u201crisky tech companies,\u201d we should keep in mind that \u201cthese are the money machines in this market.\u201d\nHowever, when asked whether he believes we are not in any kind of \u201cdanger zone,\u201d the professor said we are in the danger zone not just in terms of these seven stocks, but the market overall.\nIn this article we take a look at the Mag 7. stocks and their AI-related growth catalysts.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion. \u00a0However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it\u2019ll bode well for the stock down the road.\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta\u2019s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\nRGA Investment Advisors stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe believe this section is crucial for highlighting some of the key lessons we have learned since 2022. At the outset, let us clarify that\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) remains one of our three largest positions, fluctuating based on daily market movements. As you read this, it might in fact be our largest holding. In the closing remarks of our Q4 2022 commentary, we noted that we had \u201cmade\u2026META substantially larger\u201d during the quarter. Never did we expect the stock to generate such substantial returns in a short period of time. Between Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cYear of Efficiency,\u201d a recovery in the digital ad market and an improving macro backdrop, META\u2019s key multiples recovered to a comfortable level within their long-term ranges:\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Jim Cramer\u2019s Latest Portfolio: Top 10 Stocks in July. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "South China Morning Post ",
        "Text": "Chinese technology giants Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings have rushed to offer the latest artificial intelligence (AI) model from Facebook owner Meta Platforms into their cloud services, as the debut of Llama 3.1 drew widespread attention this week.\nAlibaba Cloud, the e-commerce giant's online computing platform, was among the first to include the latest open-source Llama family of large language models (LLMs) - the technology underpinning generative AI products such as ChatGPT - by integrating it into its Bailian model training platform, the company said on Tuesday in a post published to its official WeChat account. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\nAlibaba said it is offering one month of free compute resources that can be used for training and inferencing tasks with Llama 3.1, which launched on Monday.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nMeta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses his company's powerful new AI model, Llama 3.1, with Bloomberg. Photo: Bloomberg alt=Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg discusses his company's powerful new AI model, Llama 3.1, with Bloomberg. Photo: Bloomberg>\nShenzhen-based video gaming giant Tencent quickly followed with its own announcement the same day, saying Llama 3.1 is now available on its cloud platform. It includes a number of fine-tuning and inferencing tweaks to ensure Meta's open source models are usable in a range of areas, from intelligent conversation, text generation and writing tasks, according to the company.\nMeta is offering the latest version of Llama in three different sizes - 8B, 70B and 450B - that are named after the billions of parameters they include. The number of parameters generally corresponds with an LLM's level of sophistication.\nIn its unveiling, Meta hailed Llama 3.1 as \"the first frontier-level open-source AI model\". Early tests have compared it favourably with leading closed-source models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o.\nWidely considered the best-performing open-source LLM family, Llama models have become a default foundation model that many Chinese start-ups use to build their own generative AI products, typically with custom tweaks to change or improve performance.\nChinese industry insiders have cautioned against an over-reliance on Meta's models among domestic generative AI initiatives. Last year, Chinese AI unicorn 01.AI, founded by venture capitalist Lee Kai-fu, generated some controversy when it was found to be building on top of Llama models without being transparent about it.\nResponding to criticism that advanced open-source models benefit China, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement announcing the new models on Monday that \"decentralised and open innovation\" advantages the US.\n\"Our adversaries are great at espionage, stealing models that fit on a thumb drive is relatively easy, and most tech companies are far from operating in a way that would make this more difficult,\" he said.\nWhile open-source models have typically lagged behind the most advanced in the industry, Zuckerberg said he expects to close that gap soon. \"Starting next year, we expect future Llama models to become the most advanced in the industry,\" he wrote in his statement posted to Facebook.\nLMSYS, an AI model research organisation supported by the University of California, Berkeley, currently ranks closed-source models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google as the top as the best performing. OpenAI's GPT-4o ranks No 1, with the three companies' other models filling out most of the other top 10 spots.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The 82% EPS beats percentage for this group of 61 index members compared to 77% in 2024 Q1, 80.3% in 2023 Q4 and the average for the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) of 79.6%.\nThe 55.7% revenue beats percentage for this group of companies compares to 63.9% in the preceding period and 20-quarter low of 60.7%.\nIn other words, companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus revenue estimates at this stage in the Q2 reporting cycle.\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 61 companies with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are on track to be up +8.8% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues.\nFor a more detailed look at the Q2 earnings season and evolving expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>Q2 Earnings Season Starts Positively\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+157.4% vs. +115.3%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+48.5% vs. +14.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.It is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram.Threads have more than 175 million monthly actives. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)Amgen shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+45.4% vs. -4.4%). The company expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to offset declining revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in 2024.The addition of Horizon\u2019s rare disease drugs should further boost revenue growth. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several key pipeline data readouts are expected in 2024, including from the obesity program, MariTide.However, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds. Estimates have gone down ahead of Q2 earnings releases.(You can read the full research report on Amgen here >>>)Shares of Galaxy Gaming have underperformed the Zacks Gaming industry over the past year (-46.1% vs. +5.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $35.69 million is witnessing high debt levels, reliance on key customers, regulatory risks, intense competition, economic cycle vulnerability and integration risks as well as challenges posing from new acquisitions.Nevertheless, Galaxy Gaming's revenues for first-quarter 2024 grew 7.8% year over year to $8 million, driven by the success of EZ Baccarat and GOS product installations. EBITDA of $3 million, with a margin of 37.5%, highlights strong operational efficiency. The 10-year extension with Evolution Gaming and EZ Baccarat expansion solidifies the market position.Innovations like GOS 2.0 and global expansion, with operations in 30 countries and 5,146 table installations, enhance growth prospects. Financial stability is demonstrated with a 4.8% cash increase to $17.5 million and a net leverage ratio of 3.8x.

        "Title": "10x Banking Launches World\u2019s First \u2018Meta Core\u2019 to Help Banks Achieve Full Transformation Faster",
        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "10x Banking unveils the world\u2019s first \u2018meta core\u2019 platform for banks \u2013 a fast, straight-forward and derisked path to full transformation\nLONDON, July 29, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--10x Banking, the cloud-native core banking platform, has today announced the launch of a new category of core technology \u2013 a \u2018meta core\u2019 designed to help banks and financial services accelerate towards full transformation. The news follows 10x Banking\u2019s $45 million funding round in January, led by existing investors BlackRock and J.P. Morgan.\n10x Banking already powers the UK\u2019s fastest-growing challenger bank Chase UK, Westpac, and Africa\u2019s second largest financial services company, Old Mutual, among others. 10x currently supports banks, mutuals, building societies, financial service providers and strategic banking-as-a-service partners, with innovative banking products built on the 10x core platform live in the market serving millions of end-customers around the world.\nA meta core solves the challenges of legacy cores and avoids the complex set-up and scale challenges of neo cores, providing a de-risked, accelerated path to full cloud-native transformation.\nAntony Jenkins, 10x Banking founder and CEO said, \"10 years ago banks knew they had to go on a journey of transformation. Good progress has been made in some areas but one of the challenges that has emerged is that even the newer technologies come with their own set of problems. The \u2018meta core\u2019 provides banks with the best of all worlds: flexibility on the one hand and unlimited scalability on the other hand. The benefits are much faster speed to market, enterprise-grade security, the ability to unlock data for AI, and a lower cost base. Neo cores have created part of the solution, but we have taken it to the next level.\"\nJenkins added, \"From my experience, running a bank is all about managing risks, and we\u2019ve designed our meta core to specifically remove the key risks that banks face when upgrading their core. 10x Banking is the first company in the world to offer a \u2018meta core\u2019, which for the first time gives banks a clear roadmap to full transformation.\"\n10x\u2019s new platform allows banks and system integrators for the first time to focus development resource only on high-value code by abstracting away common product elements as well as the core ledger itself. As a result, the new 10x platform only requires a bank to create and maintain as little as 2,000 lines of code for a single customized banking product \u2013 up to a 10x reduction in code base compared to neo core platforms and up to a 10,000x reduction compared to legacy cores.\nThe 10x platform achieves this exponential reduction through its ground-breaking development tool ProductKit, built on 10x\u2019s proven SuperCore technology. ProductKit includes a rich set of pre-built modules which abstract away all the unnecessary complexity of building deposit and lending products across retail, SME and corporate banking sectors.\nDeveloper experience and efficiency are central to the new 10x Banking platform offering. A restrictive developer environment drastically hinders transformation speed. With the new 10x platform, developers have the freedom to fully-customize all 10x pre-built modules at every level using any coding language. This unique \u2018polyglot\u2019 coding environment means banks can create highly customized banking products and exceptional customer experiences quickly, without being restricted to costly or scarce development talent.\nWilliam Dale, APAC Regional Vice President at 10x Banking said, \"When it comes to the pace of innovation, APAC is leading the world. But there's also a growing awareness that the banking industry that underpins this region's fast-growing markets must modernise and move towards full cloud-native transformation. There's a wide variety of commercial and customer demands on banks and financial institutions operating in APAC, and often times they need custom solutions to local challenges. The new 10x platform gives financial institutions across APAC the ability to build and launch innovative products fit for their market without incurring outsized complexity, cost and risk - while at the same time providing a clear path to full transformation.\"\nEditors Notes\nAbout 10x Banking: https://10xbanking.com\n10x Banking is a cloud-native core banking platform for financial institutions and their partners. Founded by former banking executives and built by technologists, the 10x Banking platform empowers its customers with best-in-class security, scalability and speed.\nProven across transformational deployments including Chase Bank, Old Mutual and Westpac, 10x Banking offers banks the fastest, most cost-effective and derisked path to full cloud-native transformation through its unique \u2018meta core\u2019 approach. Its scalable, resilient, and flexible technology is built to empower financial institutions to better serve their customers and communities. 10x Banking is a B-Corp certified business with offices in London, UK and Sydney, Australia and is funded by a portfolio of world-class investors including BlackRock and J.P.

        "Title": "Europe\u2019s privacy laws put Meta in a tight spot. Now its antitrust laws are going in for the kill",
        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "A week ago, Apple became the first company to face preliminary charges under the EU\u2019s new Big Tech antitrust law, the Digital Markets Act. Now, again as predicted, it\u2019s Meta\u2019s turn.\nThough they involve the same law, the two cases are in many ways very different.\nApple stands accused primarily of making it difficult and overly expensive for app developers to steer their iOS users to cheaper deals off the platform, where Apple doesn\u2019t get to take its lucrative revenue cut. Meta, however, is in trouble for charging a hefty monthly fee to Facebook and Instagram users who won\u2019t \u201cconsent\u201d to being surveilled across Meta and third-party services for ad-targeting purposes. This allegedly violates the DMA because, in the words of the European Commission:\n\u201c[Meta\u2019s model] does not allow users to opt for a service that uses less of their personal data\u00a0but is otherwise equivalent to the \u2018personalized ads\u2019 based service [and because it] does not allow users to exercise their right to freely consent\u00a0to the combination of their personal data.\u201d\nOne case is about restricting developers; the other about railroading users. However, both take aim at core business models. Apple still earns most of its money from selling iPhones, but services (including App Store commissions) are the second-most important part of its revenue mix, and perhaps one day the most important. The data of Meta\u2019s users is and probably always will be its lifeblood. Both cases therefore have enormous ramifications for their targets\u2019 future revenue flows.\nWhat the Commission is doing to Meta is essentially data-protection enforcement through antitrust means.\nThe DMA\u2019s rules reflect the increasing tendency of tech antitrust regulators to treat piles of data like the moat-building competitive asset they are. The Commission mentions \u201cpotential advantages compared to competitors who don't have access to such a vast amount of data, thereby raising high barriers to providing online advertising services and social network services.\u201d However, while there\u2019s a solid theoretical basis to this trend, it\u2019s hard to escape the idea that regulators are also taking this tack because others have failed.\nWhat Meta has done here isn\u2019t just allegedly illegal under the DMA; it also very likely violates the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect over six years ago. But enforcement of the GDPR has been patchy and achingly slow, largely because it\u2019s the responsibility of underfunded national privacy regulators (the Irish Data Protection Commission in Meta\u2019s case.) To avoid this problem, the DMA puts the European Commission itself in the role of enforcer, while also demanding a resolution to the case within a year of the investigation opening\u2014which, for both Meta and Apple, makes next March the deadline for averting disaster.\nThe DMA also threatens much higher fines than the GDPR\u2019s 4% of global annual revenue\u2014up to 10%, or even 20% if the company persistently breaks the rules.\nFunnily enough, Meta only attempted its pay-or-consent tactic because GDPR-based court rulings removed all its other legal options for profiting off its users\u2019 data without their actual free consent. \u201cSubscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe,\u201d Meta protested in a statement this morning that also claimed its model \u201ccomplies with the DMA.\u201d\nSo, in a sense, privacy law corralled Meta into this position, and now antitrust law is going in for the kill.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 24, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Nvidia NVDA.\nSeveral Mag 7 stocks, namely Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Nvidia, have faced pressure over recent weeks, temporarily halting their remarkable runs.\nInterestingly enough, the recent negative price action has coincided with a strong move from small-caps, perhaps reflecting a bit of rotation. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each since July 11, which was the day small-caps began to roar thanks to a favorable CPI print.\nIt raises a valid question: Are these beloved stocks' runs over, or should investors stay exposed? Let's take a closer look.\nRecent cloud strength has analysts optimistic for Microsoft, with the company expected to benefit nicely from AI. Cloud revenue popped 23% year-over-year throughout its latest period, reflecting a reacceleration and positively shocking investors.\nMany had feared a cloud slowdown, which did occur for a few periods, but the recent results paint a picture of positivity moving forward. The company's cloud results have remained positive overall, consistently exceeding our consensus estimates as of late.\nIn addition, earnings expectations for its current fiscal year have remained bullish, with the $11.77 per share expected suggesting 20% year-over-year growth. The favorable earnings picture will support near-term share performance, with the recent weakness likely reflecting profit-taking.\nMETA shares have benefited nicely from improved operational efficiencies that have significantly boosted profitability. The company remains firmly in growth mode, with earnings and revenue climbing 80% and 30% throughout its latest period.\nLike MSFT, the outlook for its current fiscal year remains bullish, with the $20.21 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 24% over the last year and suggesting a 36% year-over-year jump.\nThe company has been performing nicely, with its advertising revenue positively surprising in six consecutive quarters. It's worth noting that advertising represents the bulk of META's revenue.\nIn addition, META shares aren't expensive, with the current 23.6X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 37.0X. The current PEG ratio also works out to 1.2X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth.\nWhile shares have faced pressure, the company's outlook remains notably bright, and investors should block out the noise.\nBeloved Nvidia has faced some pressure recently amid a broader cooldown in the semiconductor trade. Nonetheless, shares are still up a staggering 150% year-to-date, and its earnings outlook fully supports further near-term gains.\nThe stock maintains the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to its above-mentioned earnings outlook, which has shifted bullishly across the board. The $2.69 per share expected for its current year suggests a 100% year-over-year pop in earnings, with sales also expected to see a 90% increase.\nThe stock has been at the heart of the AI trade, with its Data Center results consistently blowing away expectations as of late.\nBreakneck growth has kept valuation multiples at historically sound levels, with the current 39.1X forward 12-month earnings multiple below the 50.7X five-year median and five-year highs of 106.3X.\nKeep in mind that shares traded well above current valuation levels in 2020 and 2021, a time when the AI theme had yet to emerge fully.\nWhile several Mag 7 stocks have faced pressure over recent weeks, their outlooks and fundamentals underneath the hood remain more than sound.\nTheir recent weakness has coincided with a strong move from small-cap stocks, perhaps a reflection of rotation and profit-taking after remarkable starts to 2024.\nNonetheless, these stocks' runs certainly aren't over, and they remain prime selections for portfolios.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "PITTSBURGH, July 09, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of a larger commitment to developing equitable technology, Carnegie Mellon University and Meta announce a collaborative project to make computer-based tasks accessible to more people. This project focuses on using wearable sensing technology to enable people with different motor abilities to perform everyday tasks and enjoy gaming in digital and mixed reality environments.\nMeta\u2019s research in electromyography uses sensors placed on the skin to measure the electrical signals the user generates through muscles in their wrist, which are translated into input signals for various devices. While Meta has already demonstrated that this technology could replace keyboards and joysticks, the team continues to invest and support different projects to confirm that this technology can be used by a wide range of people.\nDouglas Weber, a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Neuroscience Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, has shown previously that people with complete hand paralysis retain the ability to control muscles in their forearm, even muscles that are too weak to produce movement. His team found that some individuals with spinal cord injury still exhibit unique muscle activity patterns when attempting to move specific fingers, which could be used for human computer interactions.\n\"This research evaluates bypassing physical motion and relying instead on muscle signals. If successful, this approach could make computers and other digital devices more accessible for people with physical disabilities,\" said Weber.\nWorking with Meta, Weber\u2019s team seeks to build upon their initial results to assess whether and to what extent people with spinal cord injury can interact with digital devices, such as computers and mixed reality systems by using Meta\u2019s surface electromyography (sEMG) research prototype and related software.\nThe project centers on interactive computing tasks. Approved by the Institutional Review Board, study participants begin by performing a series of adaptive mini games. Once their proficiency is benchmarked, the CMU team creates new games and other activities in mixed reality that are tailored to the abilities and interests of the participant.\n\"In the digital world, people with full or limited physical ability can be empowered to act virtually, using signals from their motor system,\" explained Dailyn Despradel Rumaldo, PhD candidate at Carnegie Mellon University. \"In the case of mixed reality technology, we are creating simulated environments where users interact with objects and other users, regardless of motor abilities.\"\nThe project comes as an ongoing research investment by Meta to support the development of equitable and accessible interfaces to help people do more, together.\nAbout the College of Engineering: The College of Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University is a top-ranked, engineering college that is known for our intentional focus on cross-disciplinary collaboration in research. The College is well known for working on problems of both scientific and practical importance. Our acclaimed faculty have a focus on innovation management and engineering to yield transformative results that will drive the intellectual and economic vitality of our community, nation and world. The College offers graduate and undergraduate degree programs in biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, civil and environmental engineering, electrical and computer engineering, engineering and public policy, information networking, materials science and engineering and mechanical engineering.

        "Title": "Meta\u2019s next AI model to require nearly 10 times the power to train",
        "Author": "  Andrew Tarantola ",
        "Text": "Facebook parent company Meta will continue to invest heavily in its artificial intelligence research efforts, despite expecting the nascent technology to require years of work before becoming profitable, company executives explained on the company\u2019s Q2 earnings call Wednesday.\nMeta is \u201cplanning for the compute clusters and data we\u2019ll need for the next several years,\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the call. Meta will need an \u201camount of compute\u2026 almost 10 times more than what we used to train Llama 3,\u201d he said, adding that Llama 4 will \u201cbe the most advanced [model] in the industry next year.\u201d For reference, the Llama 3 model was trained on a cluster of 16,384 Nvidia H100 80GB GPUs.\nThe company is no stranger to writing checks for aspirational research and development projects. Meta\u2019s Q2 financials show the company expects to spend $37 billion to $40 billion on capital expenditures in 2024, and executives expect a \u201csignificant\u201d increase in that spending next year. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future,\u201d Zuckerberg remarked. \u201cBut at this point, I\u2019d rather risk building capacity before it is needed rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new inference projects.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s not like Meta doesn\u2019t have the money to burn. With an estimated 3.27 billion people using at least one Meta app daily, the company made just over $39 billion in revenue in Q2, a 22% increase from the previous year. Out of that, the company earned around $13.5 billion in profit, a 73% year-over-year increase.\nBut just because Meta is making a profit doesn\u2019t mean its AI efforts are profitable. CFO Susan Li conceded that its generative AI will not generate revenue this year, and reiterated that revenue from those investments will \u201ccome in over a longer period of time.\u201d Still, the company is \u201ccontinuing to build our AI infrastructure with fungibility in mind, so that we can flex capacity where we think it will be put to best use.\u201d\nLi also noted that the existing training clusters can be easily reworked to perform inference tasks, which are expected to constitute a majority of compute demand as the technology matures and more people begin using these models on a daily basis.\n\u201cAs we scale generative AI training capacity to advance our foundation models, we\u2019ll continue to build our infrastructure in a way that provides us with flexibility in how we use it over time. This will allow us to direct training capacity to gen AI inference or to our core ranking and recommendation work, when we expect that doing so would be more valuable,\u201d she said during the earnings call.\n"

        "Title": "Better AI Stock: Meta Platforms or Palantir",
        "Author": "  Lawrence Nga, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If there is one major trend that's revolutionizing the world today, it's artificial intelligence (AI). With its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and help its users make intelligent decisions, AI is disrupting almost every industry, from finance to education, healthcare, energy, and more.\nThis revolution will lead to winners and losers as the former openly embrace these new technologies while the latter shun them. Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). are both well-positioned to be among the winners, but which would be a better bet for your portfolio now?\nFounded in 2003, Palantir's original core business was helping the U.S. government analyze mountains of complex and unstructured data it possessed across a host of databases. With the help of Palantir's early AI software, intelligence agencies gained insights that helped them make critical decisions in their counter-terrorism operations.\nThat initial success helped the company expand its clientele to other government agencies domestically and abroad. In recent years, the tech company has leveraged the experience it gained in the public sector to help private corporations with complex tasks like fraud detection, risk management, etc. All these problems require robust software platforms that can consume vast amounts of internal and external data, analyze it, and provide useful insights to clients.\nPalantir's software platforms -- Gotham for government agencies, Foundry for private-sector clients -- can handle vast amounts of data. For example, clients can leverage their existing data infrastructures when implementing Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) solutions such as machine learning, generative AI, etc.\nPotential clients can also leverage Palantir's AIP \"boot camps\" to experiment with its software. These events allow organizations to rapidly see how the company's services could be applied directly to addressing one of their specific needs. Giving potential clients the chance to experience how its AI can help them in their existing operations puts Palantir ahead of most of its competitors, especially those still in earlier stages of developing their software solutions.\nPalantir's early-mover advantage positions it well to capture a share of the vast and growing AI market. According to forecasts from Statista, the AI market is set to reach $184 billion in 2024 and could grow to $827 billion in 2030. Palantir's revenue was $2.2 billion in 2023, so its prospects for benefiting from that market growth look bright.\nLike Palantir, Meta Platforms has the potential to be a massive beneficiary of the AI boom, though its opportunities are vastly different. Meta is predominantly a social media networking and metaverse company, so it's employing AI technologies to improve its product offerings for both users and advertisers.\nFor example, Meta is integrating AI across its apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, to enhance its personalized content feeds and recommendation systems. Better content recommendation systems help increase user engagement and promote user loyalty. Another example is to use AI to automatically translate content languages, giving users easier access to foreign content.\nSimilarly, Meta employs AI to help advertisers get better returns on their marketing spending. For example, AI can help advertisers analyze massive amounts of data, gain insights on trends, and offer recommendations on strategy. While Meta doesn't charge its advertisers for the use of these AI tools, it benefits indirectly from advertisers' success -- since advertisers whose Meta campaigns are successful will be more likely to spend more on its platforms.\nThis is another significant difference from Palantir since Palantir generates revenue directly from clients using its AI platforms, while at Meta, AI's contributions are indirect. As such, it will be difficult for investors to ascertain how AI is impacting Meta's overall financial performance.\nOn the positive end, Meta is a well-established tech giant with solid earnings and a strong balance sheet, making it a potentially less risky investment than the smaller Palantir.\nNeither of these companies appears to be cheap, especially when measured using traditional metrics like the price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. Palantir has a P/S multiple of 29 and a P/E of 243, while Meta's P/S multiple is 9 and its P/E is 29.\nComparatively, Palantir's valuations are significantly higher than Meta's, indicating that investors have higher growth expectations for the former. This makes sense since Palantir has a market capitalization of $64 billion and revenue of $2.2 billion, while Meta is a $1.28 trillion giant with a top line of $134.9 billion. The smaller company would appear to have far more runway for long-term expansion.\nStill, it's worth reiterating that these companies have very different business models, so one can't make an apples-to-apples comparison.\nThe quick answer is that there's no obvious winner. Meta Platforms is an established and wildly profitable tech giant that's actively embracing AI technologies to strengthen its business, but it does not directly make money from those AI tools. On the other hand, Palantir provides investors with direct exposure to AI since it makes money from its AI software and tools. Yet the stock is much more expensive.\nInvestors should, therefore, focus on the company they are more comfortable with -- and usually, that means the one whose business model is within their circle of competence.\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Remember Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s infamous corporate belt-tightening of 2022 and 2023 when he preached \u201cefficiency\u201d and cut thousands of jobs? These days, it\u2019s just a memory, as the company is currently on an AI spending spree. Wall Street seems just fine with that\u2014at least for now\u2014as Meta beat its Q2 earnings expectations with strong digital ad revenue, and the company\u2019s stock is up about 4% today.\nMeta\u2019s eye-popping AI spending is mostly going towards the infrastructure that supports training and running AI models\u2014such as servers, data centers, and a reported 600,000 Nvidia GPUs (which each cost roughly $30,000 each). It all adds up to the tune of\u00a0$37 billion to $40 billion in expected 2024 capital expenditures, while the company said infrastructure spending \u201cwill be a significant driver of expense growth next year\u201d as well.\nZuckerberg focused some of his earnings call comments on explaining why this AI infrastructure shopping binge will pay off with increased revenue from the company\u2019s various apps, new AI experiences, and shaping its continued work on the metaverse.\nThe bottom line? Training more and more advanced AI models is expensive: Zuckerberg pointed out that while Meta\u2019s newly released Llama 3 model is \u201calready competitive with the most advanced models,\u201d the company is already starting to work on Llama 4, which means planning for the computing power it will need going forward.\n\u201cThe amount of compute needed to train Llama 4 will likely be almost 10x more than what we used to train Llama 3\u2014and future models will continue to grow beyond that,\u201d said Zuckerberg on the earnings call. \u201cIt's hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future, but at this point, I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new infra projects.\u201d\nNot surprisingly, there were no comments given or questions asked by Wall Street analysts during the earnings call about the environmental impact of Meta\u2019s AI infrastructure efforts. But there was plenty to discuss about the potential ROI of AI investments. Zuckerberg said that improving existing Meta products with AI would drive the most results in the short-term\u2014over the next two years. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of upside\u201d to improving recommendations and advertising experiences, he explained.\nBut he warned that making money on new-gen AI products\u2014like Meta AI, the AI chatbot available on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp \u2014will take a lot longer.\n\u201cWe have a relatively long business cycle of starting a new product, scaling it to something that reaches a billion people or more, and only then really focusing on monetizing at scale,\u201d he said. When it comes to products like Meta AI or AI Studio, the company\u2019s new make-your-own AI chatbot offering which rolled out this week on Instagram, he added, \u201cI don't think that anyone should be surprised that I would expect that that will be years, right?\u201d\nOf course, Wall Street has recently worried about the massive AI spending of other Big Tech firms and how long it would take for those investments to pay off, including at Microsoft, whose stock dropped after a narrow cloud earnings miss this week.\nBut for now, it seems like as long as its AI-driven digital ad revenues stay strong\u2014and keep in mind, the artificial intelligence used for Meta\u2019s ad business uses the same traditional machine learning techniques they have used for years, not generative AI models\u2014investors will remain patient, even as they wait for the potential future profits to roll in from the promise of gen AI.\nSharon Goldman\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

        "Author": "  Noah Zahn, Wyoming Tribune-Eagle, Cheyenne ",
        "Text": "CHEYENNE \u2014 Project Cosmo, an $800 million, 750,000-square-foot data center development in south Cheyenne, has been discussed since work began to recruit the project as far back as seven years ago.\nOn Tuesday, it was officially unveiled as a data center for Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.\nThe announcement was made to an audience of around 100 people at the Cheyenne Frontier Days Event Center, including U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, both R-Wyo., Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, Cheyenne Mayor Patrick Collins, and other elected officials from local and state government.\nNew investment in Meta data center\nFrom left, Mayor Patrick Collins, Wyoming Business Council recruitment manager Wendy Lopez, U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, Meta Director of Community and Economic Development for Data Centers Bradley Davis, Gov. Mark Gordon and Cheyenne LEADS CEO Betsey Hale pose together for a picture during a new Meta data center investment announcement event in the Cheyenne Frontier Days Event Center on Tuesday.\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud to welcome Meta to Cheyenne and Wyoming,\u201d Collins said to announce the business behind Project Cosmo, followed by applause from attendees.\nMeta Director of Community and Economic Development for Data Centers Bradley Davis said this development will create around 1,000 construction jobs over the next two years, and establish 100 permanent jobs in the area.\nDavis described the data center as the engine that allows them to power apps and services like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Simply put, it is a series of network computers that will store, process and transmit data around the globe. This data center, in particular, is being designed specifically to handle artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cutting-edge technology,\u201d Davis said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be more excited to have it here in Cheyenne.\u201d\nWhen Collins first met with Meta about the project, he shared concerns about water usage in the area. Davis said it is a goal of the company to work with the needs of the communities where they develop data centers. In response, Meta chose to use a closed-loop liquid system, which Davis said is the most water-efficient option.\nIn addition, he said the center, located on a 960-acre parcel of land in the High Plains Business Park, will be powered 100% by renewable energy sources.\nWhile the development worked in partnership with Black Hills Energy, Meta has yet to identify which renewable energy projects they will be using, but they are currently evaluating options.\nDustin McKen, Black Hills Energy program manager for Wyoming, said that if they are selected as the energy provider for the project, they will likely have to create or purchase renewable energy from other providers to transport to Cheyenne and provide to Meta to meet their renewable energy goal. He also noted that Black Hills customers should not expect to see any rate increases if they are selected as the energy provider.\nDavis did not say how much water or energy use is estimated at this facility, but noted that Meta publishes annual environmental impact reports for all their data centers. He said he anticipates the numbers will be comparable to existing data centers of a similar size.\nThough it is difficult to tell how much energy the project will need, some comparable data centers may provide some insight. Meta\u2019s Stanton Springs Data Center in Newton County, Georgia, was a $1 billion investment in 2018, so it is slightly larger than Cheyenne\u2019s facility. According to Meta environmental data reports, that facility consumed 636,266 megawatt hours in 2022, which is enough energy to power nearly 60,000 U.S. homes based on average annual consumption. In the same year, it emitted 535 metric tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to the average emissions of 116 cars per year.\nLummis said it is important to keep energy production and consumption inside the Cowboy State.\n\u201cWyoming produces 12 times more energy than it consumes. And we\u2019ve gotten in the habit of taking our raw materials and sending them elsewhere,\u201d said Lummis, who is from Cheyenne. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not the future of Wyoming. The future of Wyoming is generating our industry for use in our own state, by our own people, with industries that we invite in,\u201d she said. \u201c... Because we do it well, we can provide affordable, abundant, redundant energy provided by people who can make it cleaner than anywhere in the world.\u201d\nCollins expressed his excitement at the potential for millions of dollars in state and local taxes as a result of the project.\n\u201cMeta, I just want to say thank you for your investment in our community, and for the great partnership I know we\u2019re going to have for years to come,\u201d he said.\nDavis said he envisioned this partnership as one where the trillion-dollar corporation can give back to the community in some way.\nMeta\u2019s community action grants program provides direct funding to schools, registered nonprofits and community organizations in locations where they have a data center. In Eagle Mountain, Utah, where Meta has a data center, Meta awarded an average of $210,000 in these grants to the community between 2020 and 2023.\nThe new facility will be Meta\u2019s 25th data center worldwide, and it is expected to go online in 2027.\n"

Horton, Abott, Keycorp and others, we now have Q2 results from 61 S&P 500 members or 12.2% of the index's total membership. \nTotal earnings for these 61 index members are up +7.5% from the same period last year on +4.9% higher revenues, with 82% beating EPS estimates and 55.7% beating revenue estimates. The 82% EPS beats percentage for this group of 61 index members compares to 77% in 2024 Q1, 80.3% in 2023 Q4 and the average for the preceding 20 quarters (5 years) of 79.6%. \nThe 55.7% revenue beats percentage for this group of companies compares to 63.9% in the preceding period and 20-quarter low of 60.7%. \nIn other words, companies appear to be struggling to beat consensus revenue estimates at this stage in the Q2 reporting cycle. \nLooking at Q2 as a whole, combining the actuals from the 61 companies with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total S&P 500 earnings are on track to be up +8.8% from the same period last year on +4.8% higher revenues. \nFor a more detailed look at the Q2 earnings season and evolving expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report here >>>Q2 Earnings Season Starts Positively\nNVIDIA shares have outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+157.4% vs. +115.3%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing.\u00a0The data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\u00a0Collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)Shares of Meta Platforms have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the past year (+48.5% vs. +14.0%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\u00a0It is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram.\u00a0Threads have more than 175 million monthly actives. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)Amgen shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the past year (+45.4% vs. -4.4%). The company expects strong sales growth of products like Tezspire, Evenity, Repatha, Prolia and Tavneos to offset declining revenues from oncology biosimilars and legacy established products such as Enbrel in 2024.\u00a0The addition of Horizon\u2019s rare disease drugs should further boost revenue growth. Amgen also has some key pipeline assets in obesity and inflammation, which are indications that can have a large market opportunity. Several key pipeline data readouts are expected in 2024, including from the obesity program, MariTide.\u00a0However, increased pricing headwinds and competitive pressure are hurting sales of many products, including some biosimilars. Weakness in some key brands like Otezla and Lumakras create potential revenue headwinds. Estimates have gone down ahead of Q2 earnings releases.(You can read the full research report on Amgen here >>>)Shares of Galaxy Gaming have underperformed the Zacks Gaming industry over the past year (-46.1% vs. +5.0%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $35.69 million is witnessing high debt levels, reliance on key customers, regulatory risks, intense competition, economic cycle vulnerability and integration risks as well as challenges posing from new acquisitions.Nevertheless, Galaxy Gaming's revenues for first-quarter 2024 grew 7.8% year over year to $8 million, driven by the success of EZ Baccarat and GOS product installations. EBITDA of $3 million, with a margin of 37.5%, highlights strong operational efficiency. The 10-year extension with Evolution Gaming and EZ Baccarat expansion solidifies the market position.\u00a0Innovations like GOS 2.0 and global expansion, with operations in 30 countries and 5,146 table installations, enhance growth prospects. Financial stability is demonstrated with a 4.8% cash increase to $17.5 million and a net leverage ratio of 3.8x. High customer satisfaction and a 91.7% recurring revenue model reduce financial risk.\u00a0(You can read the full research report on Galaxy Gaming here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), GE Aerospace (GE) and BHP Group Limited (BHP).Director of ResearchSheraz MianNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 8, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \"For 2024 Q2, this will be the highest earnings growth since the +9.9% growth rate in the first quarter of 2022.\"\nNote: The following is an excerpt from this week\u2019s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\nThe setup for the Q2 earnings season, whose early reports have started trickling in, is one of continued resilience coupled with a steadily improving outlook. Given the favorable revisions trend ahead of this reporting cycle, we will be looking for further improvement in the earnings outlook.\nFor 2024 Q2, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.6% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth rate since the +9.9% growth rate in the first quarter of 2022.\nEarnings growth for the Energy sector is on track to turn positive in Q2 after remaining in negative territory over the preceding four quarters.\nQ2 earnings for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 companies are expected to be up +25.5% from the same period last year on +13.2% higher revenues. Excluding the \u2018Mag 7\u2019, Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +5% (from +8.6%).\nRegular readers of our earnings commentary are familiar with our favorable take on the overall earnings picture. A big part of our positive view reflects developments on the revisions front, both for the current period (2024 Q2) as well as the remainder of the year.\nAs noted earlier, the current +8.6% earnings growth expected for the S&P 500 index is barely down from where the growth rate stood at the start of the period.\nIn addition to the Energy sector, Q2 estimates have increased for the Tech, Utilities, Transportation, and Autos sectors, helping partly offset negative cuts for the other sectors.\nThe revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\nThe 2024 Q2 quarter will be the fourth consecutive quarter of robust Tech sector earnings growth, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +15.8% from the same period last year.\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.4%, followed by another strong showing expected next year.\nSome of the major Tech stocks that have led the market\u2019s gains this year are also experiencing positive estimate revisions.\nTake, for example, Meta Platforms META and Nvidia Corp. NVDA. The current $20.16 per share earnings estimate for META for this year is up from $17.64 at the start of the year and $14.92 on June 30th, 2023. The magnitude of positive revisions to NVDA\u2019s estimates is in a league of its own.\nWe will be closely watching how the revisions trend for the space unfolds as the Q2 reporting cycle really gets going, but the early results from the likes of Oracle ORCL and Adobe ADBE suggest that we can expect continued favorable momentum here.\nA big contributing factor to the Tech sector\u2019s positive earnings outlook is the sector\u2019s margins outlook.\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year\u2019s record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector\u2019s productivity.\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +9.1% earnings growth on only +1.7% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +9.0%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +3.9%. In other words, about half of this year\u2019s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\nOn the margins front, 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4%and +55.2%per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "LAGOS (Reuters) - Meta Platforms said on Wednesday it had removed about 63,000 accounts in Nigeria that attempted to engage in financial sexual extortion scams mostly aimed at adult men in the United States.\nNigerian online fraudsters, known as \"Yahoo boys,\" are notorious for scams that range from passing themselves off as people in financial need or Nigerian princes offering an outstanding return on an investment.\nMeta said in a statement the 63,000 accounts were on Instagram, adding that it had also removed 7,200 Facebook accounts, pages and groups dedicated to providing tips on scamming people.\nThe company also took down a smaller coordinated network of around 2,500 that were linked to a group of around 20 individuals.\nIn sexual extortion, or \"sextortion\", people are threatened with the release of compromising photos, either real or faked, if they do not pay to stop them.\nThe majority of the scammers' attempts were unsuccessful and although mostly targeting adults, there were also attempts against minors, which Meta reported to the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\nMeta representatives said this was not the first time they had disrupted such networks, but added they were disclosing the current operation to \"drive awareness.\"\nThe social media giant has been on the defense in recent years as governments, including legislators in the United States where Meta is based, ramp up pressure on it to address concerns that its executives have ignored evidence that its services harm children.\nIn a hearing earlier this year, one U.S. lawmaker accused Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and other social media leaders of having \"blood on their hands\" for failing to protect children from escalating threats of sexual predation on their platforms.\nThe U.S. Surgeon General has also called for a warning label to be added to social media apps as a reminder of those harms.\nNigeria's scammers became known as \"419 scams\" after the section of the national penal code that dealt - ineffectively - with fraud.\nAs economic hardships worsen in the country of more than 200 million people, online scams have grown, with those behind them operating from university dormitories, shanty suburbs or affluent neighbourhoods.\nMeta said some accounts were providing tips for conducting scams.\n\"Their efforts included offering to sell scripts and guides to use when scamming people, and sharing links to collections of photos to use when populating fake accounts,\" it said.\n(Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Additional reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by William Maclean)\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 July 30, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL.\nGet ready for some action this week in the stock market as four of the Magnificent 7 tech giants \u2014 Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple \u2014gear up to report their quarterly earnings.\nThese tech titans have been the primary drivers of this year\u2019s return, pushing the market to new heights. But with the recent bout of market volatility, the big question remains: Is now the time for investors to dive into tech stocks?\nHere, we will explore the broader picture of the sector and potential outcomes of these quarterly earnings reports and try to figure out if any or all of them are worthy additions to investor portfolios at current levels.\nLast week, following the quarterly report from Alphabet, investors started to grow cautious. Concerns about overinvestment into AI infrastructure and its ability to generate profits moving forward have been the main cause of selling over the last week.\nManagement\u2019s comments about Capex regarding AI will be an important talking point for all these stocks.\nAlong with weakness in Alphabet, Semiconductor stocks and the other Mag 7 stocks have experienced considerable selling. But are these concerns overblown? I think they may be, and with another quarter of impressive growth likely coming, and reasonable valuations from the group, this dip could be a buying opportunity.\nAmazon is expected to post a 63.64% year-over-year increase in earnings to $0.54 per share, with revenue projected at $140.88 billion, driven by robust AWS and North American retail operations. Apple, despite a slight revenue dip to $81.64 billion, is forecasted to achieve earnings of $1.19 per share, bolstered by its services and wearables segments.\nMeta Platforms anticipates a significant earnings jump to $3.04 per share, a 45% jump and $31.05 billion in revenue, fueled by strong ad revenue and user engagement. Microsoft is projected to deliver $2.72 per share in earnings and $62.03 billion in revenue, reflecting Azure's impressive performance and continued strength in Office and LinkedIn.\nOverall, the Mag 7 is expected to bring in +26.8% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +13.7% higher revenues.\nLooking at the valuations of these tech giants we see a spectrum of results. Although they are broadly trading at reasonable levels, two of them look much more appealing than the others.\nMeta Platforms stands out with a free cash flow (FCF) yield of 4.1%, above its 10-year median of 3.2%, making it particularly attractive. Amazon too boasts an FCF yield of 2.6%, above its 10-year median of 1.8%.\nApple, on the other hand, has a FCF yield of 3%, which is below its 10-year median of 5.7%, indicating it may be pricier relative to its historical norm. And Microsoft shows a similar trend with an FCF yield of 2.2%, below its 10-year median of 3.6%.\nI think it may be a bit of a crapshoot buying these names ahead of earnings, but the reasonable valuations and secular tailwinds these companies enjoy make them compelling buys if they sell off further following the reports.\nCritical to the performance of these stocks through the end of the year is investors' perception of AI. Can these companies turn a profit in their new AI products? The answer is probably yes, but shareholders want to see hard evidence.\nAnother worthy consideration is the setup in the broader market and the approaching US Presidential Election. Big tech has been carrying the market higher all year, and it may be time for a pause in this run. Additionally, as the election approaches so does the perceived uncertainty, and investors may rotate into defensive sectors until after it concludes.\nHowever, it is hard to understate the long-term growth catalysts at these big tech companies \u2013 they are almost all expected to grow earnings faster than the market, which will drive even higher stock prices in the coming years.\nAny pause they take now, or in the coming months, is likely an opportunity to acquire shares in these generational assets.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Markets Close Higher Following Powell Presser; META, QCOM, ETSY Report",
        "Author": "  Mark Vickery ",
        "Text": "Wednesday, July 31st, 2024Markets closed higher today, in the wake of the latest Fed meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference this afternoon, gave no surprises to the market. What it did was allow speculation to continue that rate cuts are indeed on the horizon. The Dow closed +99 points, +0.24%, while the Nasdaq zoomed up +451 points, +2.64%. The S&P 500 and small-cap Russell 2000 were +1.58% and +0.51%, respectively.The Fed\u2019s press release following the meeting generated no significant waves. In fact, it read fairly boiler-plate, much along the lines of press releases throughout the year explaining that the Fed is keeping interest rates at 5.25-5.50% \u2014 where they\u2019ve now been for exactly one year. \u201cThe economy is expanding at a solid pace\u2026 nominal wage growth has eased\u2026\u201d said Powell. The Fed remains committed to its 2% inflation goal \u2014 not 2.5% or 2.6%, apparently, as we saw in last week\u2019s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data.Clearly the Fed feels they can afford seven more weeks of dwindling labor market and inflation data. PCE results are still half a point above the optimal inflation rate, but today\u2019s private-sector payrolls from Automatic Data Processing (ADP) showed only 122K jobs filled this month \u2014 basically the amount of replacement hires needed to cover all the monthly retirees. Powell did get a bit of pushback from reporters about the severity of the current labor situation, but he said, \u201cI feel good about where we are,\u201d and \u201cthe totality of data\u201d will determine rate levels.On the issue of a September cut, Powell was noncommittal. After taking a break in August, the next FOMC meeting is scheduled for September 17-18 \u2014 seven weeks from now. Powell put to rest any political considerations, considering this next meeting will be itself seven weeks prior to the General Election. \u201cIt\u2019s coming to be time to adjust (interest rates),\u201d Powell said. On whether we may see a 50-basis-point (bps) cut instead of 25 bps, he said the Fed was not thinking 50, but not ruling it out either.Meanwhile, Meta Platforms META posted a strong Q2 beat this afternoon. The parent of Facebook, Instagram and What\u2019sApp generated earnings of $5.16 per share on quarterly revenues of $39.04 billion, outpacing expectations of $4.70 per share and $38.24 billion, respectively. Operating margins came in at +38%. Daily Active People (formerly Daily Active Users) grew to 3.27 billion, Average Price per Ad gained +10% year over year, and the company has Cash and Equivalents of a whopping $58.08 billion. Revenue guidance was upped to $38.5-41 billion, even with a forex headwind of +2%.Qualcomm QCOM recorded beats in its fiscal Q3 report after the close. Earnings of $2.33 per share surpassed estimates of $2.25 (and well ahead of the $1.87 per share from the year-ago quarter), with revenues of $9.4 billion outpacing the $9.23 billion expected. Guidance of $2.45-2.65 earnings per share and $9.5-10.3 billion in sales were ratcheted up from the $2.44 per share and $9.70 billion from the Zacks consensus. It also posted a fourth-straight record high in auto chip sales. QCOM shares are up +5% in the after-market.Etsy ETSY posted a mixed Q2 late Wednesday. That said, revenues and Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS) are more important for Etsy\u2019s business than straight earnings, which missed estimates by 5 cents to 41 cents per share. Revenues grew admirably to $647.8 million from $633.5 million projected, though GMS reached $2.9 billion, -2.1% year over year. Gifting GMS grew +4.1% from a year ago. Shares had been trading down -19% year to date,\u00a0Questions or comments about this article and/or author? Click here>>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Meta must do more to address non-consensual, deepfake porn, Oversight Board says",
        "Author": "  Clare Duffy, CNN ",
        "Text": "Meta failed to remove an explicit, AI-generated image of an Indian public figure until it was questioned by its Oversight Board, the board said Thursday in a report that calls on the tech giant to do more to address non-consensual, nude deepfakes on its platforms.\nThe report is the result of an investigation the Meta Oversight Board announced in April into Meta\u2019s handling of deepfake pornography, including two specific instances where explicit images were posted of an American public figure and an Indian public figure.\nThe threat of AI-generated pornography has gained attention in recent months, with celebrities like Taylor Swift, as well as US high school students and other women around the world, falling victim to the form of online abuse. Widely accessible generative AI tools have made it faster, easier and cheaper to create such images. Social media platforms including Meta\u2019s \u2014 where such images can spread rapidly \u2014 have faced growing pressure to combat the issue.\nIn the case of the image of the American public figure posted to Facebook \u2014 which was generated by artificial intelligence and depicted her as nude and being groped \u2014 the company immediately removed the picture, which had previously been added to a matching bank that automatically detects rule-breaking images. But in the case of the Indian public figure, although the image was twice reported to Meta, the company did not remove the image from Instagram until the Oversight Board took up the case.\n\u201cMeta determined that its original decision to leave the content on Instagram was in error and the company removed the post for violating the Bullying and Harassment Community Standard,\u201d the Oversight Board said in its report. \u201cLater, after the Board began its deliberations, Meta disabled the account that posted the content.\u201d\nThe report suggests that Meta is not consistently enforcing its rules against non-consensual sexual imagery, even as advancements in artificial intelligence have made this form of harassment increasingly common. The report also points to continued issues at Meta moderating content in non-Western or non-English speaking countries, which the company has faced criticism over before.\nMeta said in a statement that it welcomed the board\u2019s decision. It added that while the specific posts identified in the report have already been removed, the company will \u201ctake action\u201d on images of the Indian public figure that are \u201cidentical and in the same context\u201d as those highlighted by the Oversight Board \u201cwhere technically and operationally possible to do so.\u201d\nIn its report, the Oversight Board \u2014 a quasi-independent entity made up of experts in areas such as freedom of expression and human rights \u2014 laid out additional recommendations for how Meta could improve its efforts to combat sexualized deepfakes. It urged the company to make its rules clearer by updating its prohibition against \u201cderogatory sexualized photoshop\u201d to specifically include the word \u201cnon-consensual\u201d and to clearly cover other photo manipulation techniques such as AI.\nAccording to the report, Meta told the board that it had not originally added the image of the Indian public figure to its rule-violating photo matching bank because there had not been news reports about it, whereas the media had covered the images of the US public figure. \u201cThis is worrying because many victims of deepfake intimate images are not in the public eye and are forced to either accept the spread of their non-consensual depictions or search for and report every instance,\u201d the Board said, adding that Meta could consider other factors, including whether an image was AI-generated when determining whether to add it to the bank.\nAfter the board began its inquiry in April, Meta added the image to its photo matching bank.\nThe push to fight non-consensual deepfakes is just part of Meta\u2019s larger efforts to prevent the sexual exploitation of its users. The company on Wednesday said it had removed around 63,000 accounts in Nigeria that were engaging in financial sextortion scams, where people (often teenagers) are tricked into sending nude images and then extorted.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Text": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Meta Platforms said on Wednesday it decided to suspend use of generative artificial intelligence tools in Brazil in response to the government's objections to its new privacy policy regarding personal data and AI.\nWHY IT'S IMPORTANT\nWith more than 200 million people, Brazil is a crucial market for Meta. For example, Brazil has the second-largest user base for Meta's WhatsApp after India.\nIn June, Meta hosted an event in Sao Paulo to launch its first AI-driven ad targeting program for businesses on the popular chat service.\nCONTEXT\nEarlier this month, Brazil's National Data Protection Authority (ANPD) decided to suspend with immediate effect the validity of Meta's new privacy policy for the use of personal data to train generative artificial intelligence systems in the country.\nANPD ruled that the company would need to adapt its privacy policy to exclude the section related to the processing of personal data for generative AI training, according to the Brazilian authority.\nKEY QUOTE\nIn a statement, Meta said it has decided to suspend the tools while it is in talks with ANPD to address the authority's doubts over generative artificial intelligence.\n(Reporting by Andre Romani and Luciana Magalhaes in Sao Paulo; Editing by Aida Pelaez-Fernandez and Cynthia Osterman)\n"

        "Title": "Meta takes down 63,000 accounts linked to sextortion scams targeting US men",
        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Facebook parent Meta (META) said on Wednesday that it has removed thousands of Instagram accounts linked to so-called sextortion scams.\nIn a blog post, the company detailed how it pulled 63,000 accounts, including a network of 2,500 accounts run by some 20 individuals, attempting to commit the financially motivated scams.\nAccording to Meta the accounts are affiliated with a group known as Yahoo Boys \u2014 no affiliation with this website \u2014 a loose collection of cybercriminals that largely operate out of Nigeria focusing on financial scams.\nThese scammers mostly targeted adult men in the US. But Meta said they also tried to target minors, leading the company to report the matter to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\nIn sextortion scams, the bad actors generally reach out to a massive number of users across social networks in the hopes of getting victims to respond \u2014 and strike up phony romantic relationships.\nOver the course of their correspondences, the scammers will request nude photos or videos of the victims, which they then say they will release to friends and family or the broader internet if the victim doesn\u2019t pay what can be hundreds of dollars in ransom.\nWhile Meta said its automated systems detected the majority of the scam accounts before they could do any damage, it used other investigative methods to find the remaining accounts and take them offline as well.\nAccording to Meta\u2019s global head of safety, Antigone Davis, the company is going public to help drive awareness of these types of scams. What\u2019s more, she said, Meta also wants criminals to know that they\u2019re picking up on these crimes and actively taking steps to block them.\nSextortion has become a growing threat in recent years, with the FBI warning about the crime in 2023 and again this year. In 2023, two Nigerian men suspected of running sextortion schemes that led to the suicide of a 17-year-old from Michigan were extradited to the US to face charges for the alleged crimes.\nIn March 2024, a third person was ordered to be extradited to the US by a Nigerian court, though he is challenging the move. The original suspects pleaded guilty in April.\nIn addition to the 63,000 Instagram accounts, Meta said it also took down 7,200 assets from Facebook, including 1,300 accounts, 200 pages, and 5,700 groups based in Nigeria dedicated to providing tips on scamming people \u2014 plus scripts to use on victims and photos to create fake accounts.\nBeyond removing the accounts, Meta says it is also providing features to help prevent users from falling for sextortion scams, including on-device nudity protection, which automatically blurs images containing nudity in Instagram direct messages.\nThere are a few ways users can recognize some of the signs of potential sextortion scammers. The most obvious is getting a message from someone you\u2019ve never spoken to before who seems to be trying to connect with you via direct messages without any prompting. Another sign is a message from someone including an image and asking for one in return.\nMeta says it also has technology that can determine if an account is exhibiting scammy or suspicious behavior and will notify users who interact with it that it may be a scam account.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": "  GlobalData ",
        "Text": "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has ceased using its AI assistant following a ban by Brazil\u2019s National Data Protection Authority (ANPD), which prohibits the company from training its AI models using personal data from Brazilian citizens.\nThe development is a setback for Meta's ambitions to expand its AI offerings in Brazil, a significant market with a populace exceeding 200 million.\n\u201cWe decided to suspend generative AI features that were previously live in Brazil while we engage with the ANPD to address their questions around generative AI,\u201d Meta spokesperson wrote in a statement to TechCrunch.\nIn June 2024, Meta had introduced an AI-based ad targeting feature for businesses on its widely used messaging service during an event in Sao Paulo.\nSoon after the launch of the ad programme the ANPD mandated an immediate halt to the enforcement of Meta's revised privacy policy concerning the use of personal data for training generative AI systems within the nation.\nThe ANPD's decision necessitates Meta to modify its privacy policy to remove provisions related to the processing of personal data for AI training purposes.\nThe ANPD's preventative action stems from \u201cthe imminent risk of serious harm and irreparable or difficult-to-repair damage to the fundamental rights of guardians\u201d, as stated in the official documentation.\nFurthermore, the ANPD has imposed a daily fine of 50,000 reais ($9000) should a company fail to comply with the ruling.\nWhile Meta has been utilising user-generated content to train its AI in the US and other regions for several years, it encountered a similar obstacle in May when it had to pause its AI training initiatives in Europe and the UK due to objections from the Irish Data Protection Commission.\n\"Meta halts AI assistant amid Brazil data privacy ruling \" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Text": "By Elisha Bala-Gbogbo and and MacDonald Dzirutwe\nABUJA (Reuters) -Nigeria fined Meta Platforms $220 million, its competition watchdog said on Friday, after investigations showed data-sharing on social platforms violated local consumer, data protection and privacy laws.\nNigeria's Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) said Meta appropriated the data of Nigerian users on its platforms without their consent, abused its market dominance by forcing exploitative privacy policies on users, and meted out discriminatory and disparate treatment on Nigerians, compared with other jurisdictions with similar regulations.\nMeta did not immediately comment, but the FCCPC said in a statement that the company had provided some documents and have retained counsels who have met and engaged with the agency.\nFCCPC chief Adamu Abdullahi said the investigations were jointly held with Nigeria's Data Protection Commission and spanned over 38 months.\nThe investigations found Meta policies don't allow users the option or opportunity to self-determine or withhold consent to the gathering, use, and sharing of personal data, Abdullahi said.\n\"The totality of the investigation has concluded that Meta over the protracted period of time has engaged in conduct that constituted multiple and repeated, as well as continuing infringements... particularly, but not limited to abusive, and invasive practices against data subjects in Nigeria,\" Abdullahi said.\n\"Being satisfied with the significant evidence on the record, and that Meta has been provided every opportunity to articulate any position, representations, refutations, explanations or defences of their conduct, the Commission have now entered a final order and issued a penalty against Meta,\" Abdullahi said.\nThe final order mandates steps and actions Meta must take to comply with local laws, Abdullahi said.\nIn May, Turkey's competition board fined Meta 1.2 billion lira following investigations on data-sharing on its Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp platforms.\nMeta has faced pushback in Europe and other jurisdictions over alleged breaches of data protection laws. Meta's plan to use personal data to train its artificial intelligence models without seeking consent has come under fire in Europe.\nMeanwhile, South Africa's competition watchdog have announced plans to investigate whether digital platforms, including Meta unfairly compete with news publishers by using their content to generate ad revenue.\n(Editing by Louise Heavens and Rod Nickel)\n"

        "Text": "By Katie Paul\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Some external vendors that police content on Facebook owner Meta's platforms were affected by the global tech outage that crippled airports, banks and hospitals on Friday, a Meta spokesperson said in response to a Reuters query.\nThe social media giant experienced a SEV1 as a result of the disruptions, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters, using Meta's term for a \"code red\"-style alert involving high-stakes problems with its systems that require urgent attention.\nIn a statement, the Meta spokesperson acknowledged the issues and said they had been resolved earlier in the day.\n\"The global CrowdStrike outage earlier today temporarily impacted several of the tools used by some of our vendors. While this caused a small impact to some of our support operations, there was minimal to no impact on our content moderation efforts,\" the spokesperson said.\nLike most social media companies, Meta relies on a mix of artificial intelligence and human review to moderate the billions of posts made to its platforms, which also include Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.\nSome of that human review is performed by Meta staffers, but most is outsourced to business services vendors employing armies of low-paid workers who assess whether the posts contain hate speech, violence and other violations of the company's rules.\nFriday's alert involved vendor access to two of the systems Meta uses to route content flagged for review to moderators, called SRT and HumanOps, the source told Reuters.\nKey vendors affected were Teleperformance and Concentrix, the person said.\nTeleperformance did not respond to a request for comment and Concentrix said it had been monitoring and addressing impacts from the outage and that operations were continuing at expected levels.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Peter Henderson and Diane Craft)\n"

Investors will be watching for strength in Meta's advertising business.\nMeta will likely discuss the company's AI opportunity after launching a new open AI model, Llama 3.1.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) is set to report second-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, with investors watching for advertising revenue strength and updates on\u00a0artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0plans after its most recent AI model announcement.\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent is expected to report revenue of $38.35 billion, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, about a 20% rise over the year-ago period. Net income is projected to be $12.31 billion, or $4.71 per share, a 58% jump from the year-ago quarter.\n\u00a0\nAnalyst Estimates for Q2 2024\nQ1 2024\nQ2 2023\nRevenue\n$38.35 billion\n$36.46 billion\n$32 billion\nDiluted Earnings Per Share\n$4.71\n$4.71\n$2.98\nNet Income\n$12.31 billion\n$12.37 billion\n$7.79 billion\nMeta will report its second-quarter ad revenue with Citi analysts expecting the figure to grow 20.5% from the year-ago period to $37.95 billion, citing a strengthening ad environment, adoption of Instagram Reels, and new products for advertisers.\nMost advertisers plan to spend more or maintain spending on Meta platforms, a survey conducted by Wedbush analysts found, which could contribute to strong second-quarter results and set the company on a positive trajectory for the second half of the year. The tech giant earlier this year expanded the AI tools it offers to advertisers.\nMeta this month unveiled its Llama 3.1\u00a0open-source AI\u00a0model. J.P.

        "Text": "Meta Platforms (META) is expected to report a 20% rise in quarterly revenue, helped by strong ad sales driven by the Olympics and elections in several countries, but investors will want to see if its spending on AI is starting to yield returns.\nThe social media giant, like its tech rivals Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft, is spending billions on tech infrastructure to support AI development. In April, Meta's upward revision in full-year expenses shaved off nearly $170 billion from its market capitalization in a single day.\nAlphabet's (GOOG) warning last week that capital expenses would stay high this year, overshadowed a jump in ad sales and pushed its stock down.\nMeta is betting on an open-source approach for its generative AI push. The company released its mostly free Llama 3.1 artificial intelligence model last week, and said developers can use and modify its AI models free of charge.\nIt has burnished its ad-buying products with AI tools and introduced new AI features such as a chat assistant to drive engagement on its social media properties. On Monday, it said it would roll out a new tool called AI Studio that would allow users to create, share and design personalized AI chatbots.\n\"We are bullish on Meta's position as a key pillar of open-source AI,\" Jefferies analysts said, adding that the company could potentially unlock new revenue streams by licensing its AI models or creating AI apps.\nMeta shares have risen 32% this year, compared with a near 16% rise in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index.\nThe company will also need to show its bread and butter ad business is thriving when it reports second-quarter results on Wednesday.\nGroupM, one of the world's largest media buying firms, raised its 2024 global advertising growth forecast to 7.8% in June, from 5.3% in December, which augurs well for Meta.\nSmaller ad-dependent companies Pinterest (PINS) and Snap (SNAP) are scheduled to report results on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.\n\"We remain positive on Meta and think Reels, Messaging and AI-driven ad improvements are still early, and could lead to positive product surprises and revenue upside,\" analysts at BofA Securities said.\n\"With political spend, and potential TikTok ban in 1Q'25, Meta could also see an ad spend benefit in 2H'24.\"\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Shounak Dasgupta)\n"
