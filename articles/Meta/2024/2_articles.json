        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is best known for its social media dominance, and for good reason. More than 3.1 billion people use one of the company's apps every day. From Facebook to Instagram, Whatsapp, and Threads, the company has become an expert when it comes to connecting people.\nAnd this expertise along with recent cost cuts and a focus on efficiency has driven earnings gains. Last year, revenue climbed in the double digits to $134 billion, and net income soared 69% to $39 billion. This is mainly thanks to advertising revenue across the company's social media platforms.\nBut Meta's focus doesn't stop at social media as we know it today. The company over time has shifted gears to invest in something that could reinforce its social media dominance, ensure advertising revenue growth, and even offer potential for new sources of revenue. I'm talking about artificial intelligence (AI). \"AI will be our biggest investment area in 2024,\" Meta chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said last year. Does this make the stock a buy? Let's find out.\nMeta isn't new to the field of AI and has progressively increased its presence in this hot technology. The company has developed the Llama family of large language models (LLMs), conversational assistant Meta AI to be used across apps, and even AI-powered smart glasses.\nThe company's goal is to make these and other products an integral part of Meta products and services. For example, one day, all Meta app users will rely on an AI assistant to help them with everything from daily tasks to addressing bigger questions. And every developer possibly could come to Meta for access to a top quality open-source model for building.\nImportantly, AI also can help Meta increase the profitability of its family of apps moving forward. Reels -- those short videos featuring a cat, a new dance move, or just about anything -- use AI to serve them to the right audience. Reels have taken off, with people sharing them 3.5 billion times every day. The more time people spend on platforms like Instagram or Meta's other apps, the more advertisers will want to catch them there -- and that equals growing revenue for Meta.\nAnd speaking of advertisers, Meta also continues to develop and improve tools to help them use AI to gain efficiency and better target their ads. These efforts, too, should keep Meta's biggest source of revenue coming back and eventually even spending more.\nSo, how does Meta plan on staying ahead in this competitive field of AI? The company aims to boost its work in AI across many levels, starting with computing power. By the end of the year, Meta aims to have 600,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) of compute, and more than half will be from top GPU maker, Nvidia. These chips, with their ability to conduct multiple tasks simultaneously, power the \"deep learning\" of AI models, making them critical to AI development.\nMeta also continues to champion open-source software infrastructure development, meaning that these platforms, such as LLM Llama, are openly available for use. This doesn't stop Meta from keeping certain product specificities proprietary -- and at the same time, the company can benefit from the input of other experts in the field to help advance the development of AI projects. As Meta notes, open-source software typically offers more security and efficiency -- and often becomes the industry standard. So, Meta has a lot to gain over the long run by fostering collaboration instead of operating behind closed doors.\nTo support general growth as well as AI expansion, Meta has increased the high end of its capital spending forecast for this year by $2 billion -- the company now expects to invest $30 billion to $37 billion, primarily in servers and data centers. Meta also plans on hiring in key areas this year to favor AI development now and over the long term.\nNow, let's get back to our question: Does all of this make Meta a buy? Meta is a social media leader, and that leadership has helped it generate billions of dollars in earnings. An investment in AI is expensive, but Meta has cut costs where needed and boosted efficiency in recent times -- so the company has what it takes financially to make this investment. And AI should drive gains in advertising revenue and could lead to other revenue sources down the road.\nEven after the stock soared more than 150% over the past year, the shares trade for only 24x forward earnings estimates -- dirt cheap for a growth stock.\nAll of these elements, together, make Meta a top stock to buy today and to hold onto for the long term.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "What a difference a year makes. In the economic turmoil that characterized 2022, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) was hit hard. Marketers pulled back on digital ad spending -- which accounts for the lion's share of Meta's revenue. For the first time in its history, the company experienced three consecutive quarters of declining revenue growth, which sent its stock price plunging 64%.\nHowever, a rebound in the ad market and excitement around artificial intelligence (AI) lit a fire under Meta Platforms last year, sending the stock up 194%. As impressive as its performance has been, this could be just the beginning.\nLet's look at several factors that could play into a banner year for Meta Platforms and why there could be much more growth ahead.\nThe macroeconomic landscape aside, one of the biggest contributors to Meta's improving outlook was the efforts it took last year to rein in spending, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg dubbed the company's \"year of efficiency.\" Initially, management expected full-year 2023 expenses in a range of $94 billion to $100 billion. However, several revised estimates and much belt-tightening later, Meta's expenses for the year clocked in at just $88 billion -- which in turn helped boost the company's bottom line.\nThat, combined with the recovering digital advertising market, had a dramatic effect on Meta's recent financial results. For the fourth quarter, revenue of $40 billion marked 25% year-over-year growth, while its diluted earnings per share of $5.33 represented a 203% surge. Meta has already said it expects its full-year expenses to be higher in 2024, but existing cost controls have already set the stage for higher profits.\nManagement is so confident in the company's prospects that Meta declared its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, a yield of about 0.44%. Based on its 2023 results, that works out to a payout ratio of about 13%, which leaves plenty of opportunity for increases.\nIt's well documented that when economic uncertainty hits, advertising is among the first areas of the budget to be cut -- and the bear market provided a prime example. During 2022, digital ad revenue grew roughly 11% year over year. While that seems respectable at first glance, it pales in comparison with the industry's 35% growth in 2021.\nGlobal ad spending is expected to increase by roughly 8% to more than $1 trillion in 2024, according to data from ad industry researcher WARC Media. Social media is expected to be the fastest-growing digital advertising medium, accounting for nearly 22% of total ad spending, according to the report. The data highlights several of the largest digital advertisers -- including Meta -- suggesting the company is \"on course to record oversized gains in the coming months.\"\nIt stands to reason that as the world's largest social media provider and second-largest digital advertiser, Meta is well-positioned to benefit from these secular tailwinds.\nThere's been plenty of excitement surrounding the advent of generative AI. While many companies are researching ways to use AI to boost their productivity, Meta Platforms has already deployed the technology to increase the efficiency of its advertising -- which in turn could boost revenue.\nLate last year, Meta announced that it was making a host of generative AI features available to all advertisers. This suite of tools can help create multiple backgrounds for ads, change the aspect ratio of images, or generate or change ad text to better target a specific audience. In early tests, Meta found that advertisers saved five or more hours per week because they could \"create multiple asset [ad] variations with the click of a button.\" These innovations alone may attract additional advertisers and further boost ad revenue.\nRaymond James managing director Josh Beck agrees and calls Meta \"a little bit of [an] unsung hero\" of AI. He specifically cites the \"incremental monetization opportunities in advertising,\" which is right in Meta's ballpark. As a result, he believes Meta can grow at twice the rate of the overall ad industry in 2024.\nWall Street seems to agree, as analysts' consensus estimates call for revenue of nearly $157 billion in 2024, a 16% increase -- which is about twice the 8% growth rate the ad industry is expected to achieve this year. It's worth pointing out that Meta has made a habit of exceeding expectations, so these estimates could end up being conservative.\nFinally, after it tripled last year, you might expect Meta's valuation to be stretched, but that's not the case. The stock is selling for 30 times earnings and 9 times sales, a slight premium to the overall market. However, its price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio -- which factors in Meta's growth rate -- is less than 1, the standard for an undervalued stock.\nGiven the ongoing rebound in digital advertising, Meta's leaner cost structure, the AI wildcard, and the company's compelling valuation, it's not too late to buy Meta stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta (META) was supposed to bring the metaverse into billions of users\u2019 homes via the company\u2019s Quest AR/VR headsets. Heck, Zuckerberg even changed the social media giant\u2019s name to reflect his lofty aspirations of creating a series of interconnected, permanently online worlds.\nBut it\u2019s looking more and more like Epic Games will be the company to turn the metaverse into reality. That\u2019s even more likely after Disney (DIS) announced it is investing $1.5 billion in the \u201cFortnite\u201d game developer.\nIn the press release announcing the investment, Disney stopped just short of referring to the deal as a means of bringing the metaverse to life, saying, \u201cThe new persistent universe will offer a multitude of opportunities for consumers to play, watch, shop and engage with content, characters and stories from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar and more.\u201d\nIf that isn\u2019t a kind of metaverse I don\u2019t know what is. That\u2019s especially true considering the \u201cpersistent universe\u201d will be run through Epic Games\u2019 \u201cFortnite,\u201d the wildly popular competitive online shooter and building game.\n\u201cFortnite\u201d is already home to online concerts, and recently introduced a Lego \u201cFortnite\u201d game, racing game, and music-based game.\nMeta, meanwhile, is continuing to invest in the metaverse, with Zuckerberg calling out the technology during the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, but it\u2019s seemingly taking a backseat to artificial intelligence. In fact, the CEO dedicated the bulk of his prepared remarks during the call to Meta\u2019s AI investments.\nYes, he mentioned that the company\u2019s Reality Labs segment saw $1 billion in revenue in the quarter and that its Horizon app is among the 10 most-used apps for Quest. But he also sprinkled plenty of AI talk into his metaverse bit, saying that the company\u2019s Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses offer a better experience thanks to Meta AI and that the glasses are a way for people to interact with AI.\nIn other words, it certainly looks like Epic has beat Meta to the punch with the metaverse. And the gap is only likely to expand from here.\nEpic CEO Tim Sweeney is a metaverse believer. In May 2023, when Business Insider published an article saying the metaverse would join the list of failed tech industry fads, Sweeney tweeted a response jokingly calling for an online wake so \u201c600,000,000 monthly active users in Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, PUBG Mobile, Sandbox, and VRChat can mourn its passing together in real-time 3D.\u201d\nSweeney is right that there are millions still playing games like \u201cFortnite,\u201d \u201cMinecraft,\u201d and \u201cRoblox,\u201d but the metaverse concept had lost considerable steam. Companies ranging from Microsoft to, yes, Disney ended their metaverse projects as AI took over as the go-to technology for the industry.\nBut Epic and Meta have kept charging forward. While Meta has poured billions into its Quest products, Epic has added characters and intellectual property from the likes of Marvel, \u201cDragon Ball Z,\u201d \u201cNaruto,\u201d \u201cHalo,\u201d \u201cJohn Wick,\u201d and \u201cStranger Things\u201d to \u201cFortnite.\u201d\nMeta, however, has struggled mightily to get consumers hooked on its Horizon Worlds app. In 2022, the Wall Street Journal reported that the app fell well short of its goal of hitting 500,000 users per month, instead reaching less than 200,000. The company revamped the app in 2023 with an eye towards adding more games.\nEpic, meanwhile, announced a trio of games in December including \u201cLego Fortnite,\u201d an open-world survival game in which players craft objects out of Lego bricks; \u201cFortnite Rocket Racing;\u201d and \u201cFortnite Festival.\u201d Each game allows you to bring your \u201cFortnite\u201d character skins, in-game outfits, with you, creating a seamless series of worlds for your \u201cFortnite\u201d avatar.\nAdding Disney and its various characters and unique locales to the \u201cFortnite\u201d formula should help keep players coming back to Epic\u2019s interconnected collection of online games.\nIt\u2019s important to point out that Epic and Meta aren\u2019t the only companies building out their respective metaverses. Roblox (RBLX) also continues to put together its concept of the metaverse. And in its most recent quarterly earnings report, the company announced it hit $1 billion in bookings.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Zuckerberg seemingly refuses to give up on the metaverse. This despite the fact that the company lost $16.1 billion on the effort in 2023 alone. That\u2019s up from $13.7 billion in 2022.\nPart of Meta\u2019s problem is that its metaverse largely requires users to jump in via its line of Quest headsets. The company did launch a Horizon Worlds mobile app to lower the barrier to entry, but it just doesn\u2019t have the appeal \u201cFortnite\u201d has to offer.\nZuckerberg is also facing increased competition in the headset space from Apple\u2019s new Vision Pro. On Tuesday, he posted on Instagram Reels, saying that after using the Vision Pro he believes the Quest 3 is the overall better product, not just the less expensive option.\nBut getting people to pony up and stick with the Quest will take more than just dunking on the Vision Pro.\nStill, the tech and gaming industries are fickle. And with Zuckerberg determined to make his vision of the metaverse a reality, it could end up paying off in the long run. For now, though, \u201cFortnite\u201d is eating his lunch.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "Text": "Mark Zuckerberg laid out Meta's gameplan for \"playing to win\" against Alphabet and Microsoft in the high-stakes AI arms race. Meta's secret weapon: its walled garden of data.\n\"There are hundreds of billions of publicly shared images and tens of billions of public videos, which we estimate is greater than the common crawl data set,\u201d Zuckerberg said on Meta\u2019s earnings call on Thursday. It was a not-so-subtle jab at competitors Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, which are training their AI models on the public web data crawled by their search engines every day.\nBeyond the generative AI technology that Meta already offers in its battle against the other Big Tech powers (including Apple, which teased on its earnings call Thursday that it would launch a generative AI product later this year), Zuckerberg is aiming for \u201cgeneral intelligence,\u201d the still unproven concept of a general purpose AI that can handle most tasks better than humans.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be building the most popular and advanced AI products and services. If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done,\u201d Zuckerberg said, even as his management team hinted at the hefty price tag of carrying out the project. Meta\u2019s capital expenditures could increase by as much as $9 billion this year, totalling between $30 billion to $37 billion, compared to $28.1 billion in 2023.\nAnd the company suggested this could be the new normal, noting that \u201cwe expect our ambitious long-term AI research and product development efforts will require growing infrastructure investments beyond this year.\u201d\nIt\u2019s probably no coincidence that Meta announced its first ever cash dividend to investors on Thursday. The new, 50-cent quarterly dividend, along with strong results in Meta\u2019s core advertising business, ignited Meta\u2019s stock, which shot up 14.5% in after hours trading.\nZuckerberg initially unveiled his vision for artificial general intelligence last month in an Instagram Reels video. On Thursday, he expanded on the plan, describing it as not just a far-off science project, but an effort that will incorporate AGI into Meta products like Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp.\n\u201cIt's clear that we're going to need our models to be able to reason, plan code, remember, and many other cognitive abilities in order to provide the best versions of the services that we envision,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing to win here, and I expect us to continue investing aggressively in this area.\u201d\nTo realize his vision of Meta as the AI leader, Zuckerberg has yet to expand on how exactly Meta user activity will be used as training data for Meta\u2019s AI, and how the company will navigate the potential issues around user privacy.\nAnd it remains to be seen whether Zuckerberg\u2019s confidence in the value of Meta\u2019s training data compared to the vast corpus of web data used by Google is as big of an advantage as he believes. Google has the data treasure trove of YouTube, Google Office and its search engine. Still, Google AI is close-sourced so can only move as fast as engineering talent, whereas Zuckerberg pointed to his company\u2019s open source Llama model as another key advantage.\nEarnings aside, this has been a big week for Meta\u2019s head honcho. Yesterday Zuckerberg was skewered during a U.S. Senate hearing where he, most notably, stood up and apologized to families whose children died from harms inflicted by social media. (Though he did not agree to compensate the families for the harms they suffered at Senator Hawley\u2019s request.)\nWhile the apology may have been wrenching for Zuckerberg, his net worth rose by $1.6 billion (per Forbes) on Thursday with Meta\u2019s stock performance.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Timothy Green, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The big surprise in Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) fourth-quarter earnings report last week was the initiation of the social media giant's first-ever dividend. Meta will pay $0.50 per share to shareholders of record on Feb. 22. On an annualized basis, that works out to a dividend yield of about 0.5%.\nThis dividend yield will likely grow over time as Meta boosts its payout, although share buybacks are still a big part of the equation. Along with the dividend announcement, Meta disclosed that an additional $50 billion had been allocated for share buybacks. Meta poured nearly $20 billion into buying back its own stock in 2023; the dividend will eat up just over $5 billion over the next year if it remains at its current level.\nFor dividend investors, Meta is a tough sell. There's plenty of room to grow the dividend over time; Meta reported a net income of $39 billion and a free cash flow of $44 billion for 2023. However, share buybacks appear to be the priority. If Meta takes the same path as Apple, which has been paying a dividend for a decade but still sports a dividend yield of around 0.5%, the dividend will never be all that consequential.\nAnother wrinkle is Meta's valuation. The stock isn't overly expensive, but it's not cheap, either. With a market capitalization of around $1.2 trillion following a post-earnings rally, the stock trades for roughly 27 times free cash flow.\nWhile Meta reported strong growth in Q4, with revenue surging 25% year over year and net income more than tripling, there's plenty of long-term uncertainty. For one, the core social media business faces the prospect of increased regulation. \"We could regulate you out of business if we wanted to,\" said Senator Thom Tillis during a recent Senate hearing with top social media executives focused on child safety.\nMeta's vast investments in the metaverse and artificial intelligence (AI) also have unclear and uncertain payoffs. Reality Labs, Meta's metaverse-focused division, reported an operating loss of $16 billion in 2023, and the company is pouring additional cash into AI hardware. Improving its various platforms with AI features makes sense, but it will be an expensive proposition.\nFor those not sold on Meta's long-term potential, International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) looks like a far better deal. IBM's artificial intelligence strategy is crystal clear: Help its enterprise clients deploy AI technology through a mix of software and consulting services.\nWhile IBM's watsonx AI platform is a key component of this strategy, consulting is what brings customers in the door. The company disclosed in its Q4 report that AI commitments from customers doubled in Q4 from Q3, with two-thirds of business driven by the consulting arm.\nIBM produced $11.2 billion of free cash flow in 2023, and strong demand for AI products and services will contribute to growth in 2024. The company is eyeing $12 billion of free cash flow in 2024, which puts the price-to-free cash flow ratio at about 14, or roughly half that of Meta.\nIBM is growing more slowly than Meta, with mid-single-digit revenue growth expected for 2024. However, IBM's business comes with less uncertainty. While demand for IBM's enterprise software and services will ebb and flow with economic conditions, the company doesn't face existential threats like Meta's social media business, and it isn't relying on a moonshot like Meta's metaverse business.\nThen there's the dividend. IBM has paid a quarterly dividend uninterrupted since 1916, and it's raised that dividend annually for nearly three decades. Based on the latest quarterly payment of $1.66 per share, IBM stock currently sports a dividend yield of about 3.6%, more than double the S&P 500's meager 1.4% yield.\nThat dividend is well covered by free cash flow. IBM is set to pay out approximately $6.1 billion in dividends over the next year, which will eat up a hair over 50% of its free cash flow. This leaves plenty left over for other uses, including debt reduction, acquisitions, and a potential restart of share buybacks. IBM suspended all share buybacks after its megadeal for software company Red Hat closed in 2019.\nShares of IBM have rallied over the past year, gaining nearly 40% as investors started to buy into the company's growth story. While IBM isn't a growth stock like Meta, a combination of less uncertainty, a discounted valuation, and a far more generous dividend makes IBM stock a better buy.\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

        "Text": "Meta Platforms' (META) stock rocketed higher on Friday, climbing more than 20% after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and guidance and announced new shareholder return initiatives.\nWith Friday's rally, the company added nearly $200 billion to its market cap, a stock market record according to Bloomberg data. Meta shares were trading around $475 on Friday; at its lows in 2022, the stock fell to as low as $90.\nMeta's market cap now stands north of $1.2 trillion.\nFor the fourth quarter, Meta reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.33 on revenue of $40.11 billion. Analysts were anticipating adjusted EPS of $4.94 on revenue of $39.01 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported revenue of $32.2 billion in the same quarter last year.\nThe company also boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion and initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. In the current quarter, Meta said it anticipates revenue of between $34.6 billion and $37 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations for revenues to tally $33.6 billion.\nMeta's advertising revenue came in at $38.7 billion in the fourth quarter, beating expectations for $37.8 billion. The company also reported 2.11 billion Facebook daily active users. Wall Street was anticipating 2.07 billion.\nThe company reported ad impressions rose 21% over last year during the period while the average price per ad fell 2%.\nMeta's Reality Labs, however, continues to be a burden on the company. The division, which is tasked with turning Zuckerberg\u2019s vision of the metaverse into a reality, lost another $4.65 billion, up from the $4.3 billion the company lost on the endeavor in the same period last year. Still, the division beat expectations on revenue, topping $1.07 billion versus an anticipated $812 million.\nThe launch of Apple\u2019s rival Vision Pro headset could create a jump in consumer interest in AR/VR headsets and generate a knock-on effect for Meta\u2019s Quest line of headsets.\nBut Meta's Reality Labs efforts have taken a backseat in the minds of investors amid increased investments in generative AI. In January, Zuckerberg announced in an Instagram Reels post that the company's long-term strategy was to develop general artificial intelligence and make it open source.\nThere's no single definition of generative AI, but broadly speaking, it\u2019s a kind of AI that can think and learn like a human. In other words, it's capable of understanding a multitude of concepts rather than specializing in a certain field.\nIn 2024, Meta expects its expenses to total $94 billion-$99 billion, with the company noting, among other things, that payroll costs will rise this year as it adds more staff in higher-cost, technical roles amid its push into AI features.\nMeta also disclosed that in 2023 restructuring charges, including severance and facilities consolidation, totaled $3.45 billion. The company's head count as of Dec. 31, 2023, stood at 67,317, down 22% over the prior year.\nMeta has been on a hot streak over the last 12 months, with shares rocketing 121% over that period and outperforming the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN).\nIn January, the company\u2019s market capitalization once again eclipsed the $1 trillion mark.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "On Feb. 1, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended Dec. 31, 2023. For the quarter, revenue increased 25% year over year, total costs and expenses decreased 8%, income from operations grew 156% and diluted earnings per share rose by a whopping 203%. The company announced its first-ever cash dividend and a $50 billion increase in the share repurchase authorization.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nMeta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg was very happy with the results as he remarked, \"We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow, we've made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.\"\nObviously, investors agreed with Zuckerberg as Meta's shares soared 20% after the earnings report, adding more than $200 billion in market value in one day. The social media giant's earnings are very impressive compared to the other big tech companies.\nMeta's reports through two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The Family of Apps includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and other services. Reality Labs includes augmented, mixed and virtual reality-related consumer hardware, software and content.\nIn terms of revenue contribution, the FoA segment accounted for more than 96% of Meta's revenue. Within the FoA segment, almost 100% of the revenue came from advertising revenue. Clearly, advertising is Meta's most important revenue source.\nMeta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li explained the strong growth in advertising revenue for the quarter and year during the earnings call:\nFor full year 2023, the largest contributors to year-over-year ad revenue growth were the online commerce, CPG, entertainment and media and gaming verticals. The online commerce and gaming verticals benefited from strong demand by advertisers in China reaching people in other markets. In 2023, revenue from China-based advertisers represented 10% of our overall revenue and contributed 5 percentage points to total worldwide revenue growth.\nWe can see that Chinese advertisers were the biggest drivers for Meta's revenue growth, which is consistent with the third quarter of 2023. During that quarter's earnings call, Li gave a more detailed answer regarding Chinese advertisers' growth:\nTo give you a little bit of color, in North America, we saw accelerate by 7 points due primarily to strong demand from China advertisers. Note that North America didn't experience the same currency tailwinds that drove acceleration in year-over-year growth for the other regions. In the EU or in our EU region, we saw that accelerate 21 points. There was a broad-based acceleration in the region, including demand from China advertisers and some benefit from currency tailwinds after facing currency headwinds in Q2. Brazil was a strong contributor to the region's acceleration due in part to increased advertisers' demand from China advertisers targeting users in Brazil.\nBy China adverisers, obviously Li meant Shein and Temu from PDD Holdings (PDD), especially Temu. According to a WSJ article published on Nov. 28, 2023:\nForty-six percent of Temu's digital ad spend so far this year went to Facebook, 22% went to Instagram, and 15% went to YouTube, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. The wave of spending by China-owned retailers is affecting the overall online ad business. Temu and rival Shein are 'almost single-handedly having an impact on the cost of advertising, particularly in some paid channels in Google and Meta,' Etsy CEO Joshua Silverman said during an earnings call with analysts earlier this month. Susan Li, chief financial officer at Meta, has also credited unnamed Chinese retailers with helping to sustain the company's ad business in recent months.\nCNBC also reported that:\nJMP analysts estimated that Temu and Shein spent roughly $600 million and $200 million, respectively, on Facebook and Instagram ads in the third quarter. That would suggest they accounted for about 3% of Meta's total growth in the period, according to JMP. Research from data.AI prepared for CNBC shows that Temu notched 73.87 million downloads in 2023, up more than 500% from a year prior. Shein's downloads increased around 52% over that stretch to 36.93 million.\nTemu's growth is truly extraodinary. The e-commerce site was launched in the U.S. in September of 2022. After the launch, it had to spend aggressively in order to attract customers and gain brand recognition. Fortunately for Meta, Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp are all important advertising channels that can give Temu the broadest reach, not only in the U.S., but across the globe.\nTemu has spent a lot on Meta's social apps in 2023. The important question is whether its advertising spending is sustainable in 2024 and beyond. Even if Temu's advertising spending is sustainable, are Meta's social apps still the most effective and efficient channels for it? I will not assume that Temu will continue to contribute such growth for Meta in 2024 because its user growth has already slowed down in the U.S. and it is almost guaranteed that Meta's exposure to Temu and Shein will be a political target from both Democrats and Republicans. Therefore, I think conservative investors should assume Meta's revenue growth will slow down in 2024 due to slower advertising growth from Temu on Meta's apps.\nMeta has benefited from both a Year of Efficiency as well as Chinese advertisers' increased growth in 2023. But in 2024, both tailwinds are likely to subside. At 31 times 2023 earnings and 23 times estimated 2024 earnings, Meta's stock is not very expensive, but not very cheap either. Investors should keep a close eye on Temu and Shein's advertising revenue growth in the next two to three years.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  Jon Quast, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "On Feb. 1, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) reported its biggest and most profitable quarter in history. Its \"family of apps\" includes Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. And this trio absolutely delivered for shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nIn Q4, Meta's revenue grew 25% year over year. This was its best growth rate in over a year, boosting its full-year revenue to a whopping $135 billion.\nMeta Platforms' Facebook enjoyed user growth from around the world in Q4, finishing with 2.1 billion daily active users. Management was upbeat about the results for Instagram and WhatsApp as well. These apps primarily make money through advertising. And in Q4, ad impressions (the number of times an ad was displayed) were up a strong 21% year over year.\nMeta Platforms is clearly a business that revolves around advertising on its various social platforms. And this division of the business is extremely profitable, generating operating income of nearly $63 billion in 2023.\nHowever, Meta Platforms is betting the future of the company on something else entirely. And in 2023, this other division had an operating loss of more than $16 billion, worsening from its prior-year operating loss of almost $14 billion.\nWhen it comes to Meta's long-term vision, co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn't intend to sit back and just let the advertising profits pour in. In the Q4 earnings call, Zuckerberg addressed the long-term vision by saying, \"We have two major parts of our long-term vision, and in addition to AI the other part is the metaverse.\"\nThe metaverse is a fuzzy concept. But think of it as a digital world people experience through immersive hardware devices, such as virtual reality (VR) headsets. Inside the digital world, users can interact socially, have experiences, conduct commerce, and more.\nZuckerberg is all-in on the future of the metaverse, as evidenced by his decision to rebrand the entire company to Meta Platforms in 2021. It's also evidenced by how much money the company is investing in its Reality Labs business segment -- the part that involves its Metaverse vision.\nIn 2023, Meta's Reality Labs generated $1.9 billion in revenue (mostly hardware sales for its Quest headset device). But this segment racked up a $16.1 billion loss for the year.\nHere's another stat that may shock investors: From 2019 through 2023 (five full years of results), Meta Platforms generated just $8 billion in revenue from Reality Labs. However, its operating loss from Reality Labs over this period is over $51 billion.\nTo put that number into perspective, consider that the S&P 500 is an index comprised of the largest, most profitable U.S. companies. Occidental Petroleum is currently the 165th-largest company in the index.\u00a0Meta Platforms could have paid cash for this oil company with its metaverse losses alone.\nWith a market capitalization of nearly $1.2 trillion as of this writing, $51 billion over five years isn't that big of a number for Meta Platforms, as strange as that might sound. Granted, ongoing losses for that division and lackluster growth (it generated more metaverse revenue in 2021 than in 2023) aren't ideal. But relative to the size of the overall business, Meta can afford this gamble.\nThe problem with being a trillion-dollar company is that it will be hard for Meta Platforms to find market-beating growth. Simply put, it needs ginormous ideas, and the metaverse is a big enough possibility that it may be worth pursuing.\u00a0Many third-party research reports project that the metaverse will be worth hundreds of billions of dollars by 2030.\nMoreover, the technology for making the metaverse possible is improving all the time. Besides Meta's Quest headsets, Apple just launched its Vision Pro, which is being celebrated by the media -- award-winning filmmaker James Cameron praised the Vision Pro to the point of calling it a \"religious\" experience.\nEven Disney is getting in on the action by unveiling its HoloTile device -- a floor mat that allows VR users to walk around the digital space while staying in one place in the physical space.\nThe point is that metaverse technology is clearly improving. Meta Platforms' investments haven't paid off yet. But perhaps traction will come as the user experience improves.\nEven if it doesn't pay off, I'm not sure investors should be too hard on Meta Platforms here. Given the strength of its core business, it can afford to make a big long-term bet on the future. But one thing's for sure: If it's going to enjoy long-term market-beating growth from here, it needs a big bet to pay off.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Let's talk about the popular Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). The company's shares led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s take a look at Meta Platforms\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 15% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Meta Platforms today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $569.87, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Meta Platforms\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Meta Platforms' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 69%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? META\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on META, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

        "Text": "After disappointing investors in 2022, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) delivered stellar returns in 2023 alongside the recovery of tech stocks. The company started 2024 on the right foot as well, handsomely beating Wall Street expectations for both earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter. Meta seems to be following in the footsteps of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is evident from its newfound interest in rewarding shareholders handsomely, not just with buybacks, but also with dividends. In a surprise move, the company announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share, initiating a dividend program against all odds. The company also boosted its stock repurchase authorization by $50 billion to complement the dividend. Stellar fourth-quarter earnings coupled with the company's announcement of its first-ever dividend sent the stock 20% higher following the earnings report last week.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nA closer evaluation of Meta's prospects reveals it is well-positioned to grow from here and is still reasonably valued despite a meaningful expansion in valuation multiples in the last 12 months.\nFrom a high of 41% in 2019, Meta's operating margin reached a trough of 28.80% in 2022 with the company's aggressive investments in the metaverse failing to deliver the desired returns. Deteriorating operating margins forced the social media giant to take bold steps to improve its profitability in 2023, starting with the launch of a new campaign named Year of Efficiency. The company's operating margin ballooned to 36.30% in 2023 with it benefiting from several positive changes it implemented over the last 12 months. This is a positive sign as Meta is now moving forward as a more agile, leaner company that is capable of aggressively investing in artificial intelligence.\nMeta was among the many tech companies to focus on a lean business structure in 2023. The company ended the year with 67,317 employees compared to a total headcount of 86,482 in 2022. Despite a notable reduction in headcount, it performed exceptionally well across all of its business segments, including 16% year-over-year growth in revenue, 8% growth in family daily active people and a 28% increase in ad impressions. Meta's aggressive layoffs in the last 15 months have helped its operating performance, which is evident from the meaningful margin improvement reported for 2023.\nMeta's mass layoffs should not cloud the judgment of investors when it comes to evaluating its long-term prospects. Despite a focus on efficiency gains, the company has not lost its focus on strategic investments to ensure long-term growth.\nDuring the fourth-quarter earnings call, the company highlighted its commitment to deploying approximately 350,000 H100 chips to develop world-class computing infrastructure to penetrate the opportunities in the AI space. The massive computing power of the company will be used to improve Reels and develop AI capabilities to support the growth of Reels across Facebook and Instagram.\nThe company is also investing in custom silicon for specialized workloads to further accelerate the company's expansion as an AI-first social media giant. Last May, the company unveiled MTIA, Meta's first-generation AI inference accelerator, to handle content understanding, feeds and ads ranking more effectively.\nMeta's investments in AI will enable it to develop and deploy advanced AI services on its platforms in the future, potentially dealing a massive blow to its rivals who are still at the infant stages when it comes to deploying AI to improve ad performance and user retention.\nThe company is taking a long-term approach to AI development, spending millions of dollars every quarter on developing Llama models 5,6 and 7 to emerge as a leader in the generative AI space. These AI investments will directly impact revenue in several ways going forward.\nFirst, Meta is using AI to enhance its advertising platform. %he company has already launched Advantage+, a portfolio of solutions aimed at improving the return on investment of advertisers. This product suite allows advertisers to automate parts of the campaign creation process, including audience targeting, likely leading to efficiency gains. The company has also introduced text variation and image expansion features using generative AI to help marketers create high-quality advertisements to reach a global audience.\nSecond, Meta is leveraging AI to improve business messaging capabilities on WhatsApp Business. The company is testing AI-driven business support in chat to help business owners seamlessly conduct business through WhatsApp. According to management, click-to-message ads are continuing to grow and the potential integration of AI into business messaging should boost the revenue from this ad segment in the future.\nThird, Meta continues to heavily invest in Reality Labs, including investments in augmented rality and virtual reality product development, which should create new revenue streams in the long run. The company's VR headset, Oculus, is already bringing in revenue, but is still at an infant stage when it comes to unlocking the true potential of the mixed-reality headset space. With additional investments in AI supporting the introduction of groundbreaking features, Meta may emerge as a global leader in the AR/VR product space in the long run.\nOverall, Meta's strategic investments in AI should help its growth in the coming years.\nJust over five years ago, Apple decided to pursue a net cash neutral goal when it started generating more than enough cash from operations to support investments and debt repayments. To achieve this objective, the company aggressively repurchased stock and paid dividends, rewarding long-term shareholders. For context, Apple spent an average of $37 billion per year on share repurchases between 2013 and 2018, but since then, it has spent $82 billion on stock buybacks per annum. Unlike Apple, Meta Platforms still enjoys a long runway for growth and the company is investing to expand. However, Meta also generates substantial operating cash flows ($71 billion in 2023) and the company only carries $18 billion in long-term debt. This strong financial position allows it to distribute wealth to shareholders, which is exactly what the company is doing today.\nApple's net income has grown at a compound annual rate of 10.25% between 2018 and 2023, but earnings per share grew at an annualized rate of 15.51% over the same period, aided by substantial buybacks that reduced the share count. Meta, on the other hand, is well-positioned to see strong net income growth, so aggressive buybacks will multiply earnings per share growth in the next few years. Strong earnings growth should support premium valuations.\nMeta, at a forward price-earnings ratio of 23.92, is expensively valued compared to its five-year average of 22.23. This premium valuation, however, seems justifiable given the company is in better shape than ever to grow profitably, aided by its continued dominance in the social media space and the narrowing losses of the Reality Labs division. Meta's buybacks will also play a major role in boosting earnings growth, thereby allowing the company to trade at higher stock prices without a further expansion in earnings multiples.\nInvestors will have to monitor a few key risks, including the company's exposure to China (approximately 10% of revenue in fourth-quarter 2023) and the regulatory challenges in North America and Europe.\nMeta Platforms stock, even on the back of a 146% gain in the last 12 months, looks reasonably priced at a time when it is enjoying a noteworthy expansion in profit margins, which allows it to invest in its future while rewarding shareholders with dividends and buybacks. Some volatility is expected in the coming months if macroeconomic conditions in China threaten Meta's short-term profits, but in the long term, the company should thrive even if its China business faces a permanent decline.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "Few companies have taken investors on as much of a roller coaster ride as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), formerly known as Facebook. In late 2021, Meta's stock hit an all-time high of $382 before plummeting to a bottom of $89 per share in late 2022 -- a greater than 76% drop.\nHowever, the stock has marched straight up since then, setting a new all-time high in January 2024 before jumping an astounding 20% to $475 after reporting Q4 earnings.\nWith Meta Platforms solidly back in the trillion-dollar stock club, many investors may wonder if it's time to take some gains or sell the stock outright. After all, if you bought at the bottom, you're up 434% in just over a year. Despite a strong temptation to do that, I think it's a mistake, especially after reviewing what the company said.\nWhile Meta Platforms changed its name to signal its shift to focusing on the metaverse, it's still an advertising business at heart. Its Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads platforms generate a massive amount of revenue from ads.\nThis was part of the reason Meta's stock was so beaten down in 2022. Meta was heavily investing in its money-losing metaverse products and, at the same time, its ad business was suffering. However, both of those markets have substantially turned around.\nThe move in the ad market came in Q3, as ad revenue rose 24% year over year to $33.6 billion. That strength continued into Q4, with ad revenue again rising 24% to $38.7 billion. Combined with various optimization efforts across the business (mainly accomplished through layoffs), this segment delivered an impressive $21 billion in operating income -- a 54% margin.\nBut what CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants to work on is Reality Labs' revenue, which broke $1 billion in sales for the first time, thanks to the strength of its Quest 3 headset. This division is still far from profitable, as its operating loss was $4.6 billion -- the highest it has ever been. Thanks to its ad business doing better, Zuckerberg was again sinking a lot of money into this bet and noted that Reality Labs' operating losses would increase meaningfully in 2024 due to product development efforts.This is a reversal from Zuckerberg's previous stance of making 2023 the \"year of efficiency.\" However, now that Meta has downsized and its ad business is doing better sinking money into the Reality Labs division is more palatable to investors.\nStill, with Meta's primary business doing as well as it is, this increase may not matter. But with a price movement like Meta has experienced, is it still worth owning?\nMeta's business has done so well over the past year because it was valued at incredibly low levels at worst-case scenario margins. Now that its margins have improved and investors are more optimistic, Meta has returned to a point where it's historically valued.\nBy dividing the stock price by its earnings per share, we can understand how much investors are willing to pay for the stock. With it at 32 times trailing and 25 times forward earnings, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is within a range where investors should still feel comfortable adding to their position.\nMeta is also cheaper than other tech giants. Microsoft and Apple trade at a respective 37x and 30x trailing earnings and 36x and 28x forward earnings. To state Meta is an overvalued stock isn't a fair assessment. Right now, it's at an average valuation, which means its business results will drive the stock price.\nWith Meta guiding for $35.8 billion in revenue in Q1 (growth of 27%), I'd say the future business is looking good. As a result, I think the stock is a strong buy now, even though it might have been cheaper to purchase just a few days ago.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with META.\nOn February 1, 2024, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) released its 8-K filing, revealing a significant uptick in its financial performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year ended December 31, 2023. The company, known for its expansive social network ecosystem that includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services, has reported a substantial increase in revenue and net income, reflecting the company's focus on operational efficiency and growth in its advertising business.\nMeta's fourth-quarter revenue rose to $40.11 billion, a 25% increase compared to the same period in 2022. This growth was mirrored in the company's full-year revenue, which climbed 16% to $134.90 billion. The impressive revenue figures were bolstered by a 21% year-over-year increase in ad impressions delivered across the Family of Apps and a 2% increase in the average price per ad for Q4.\nNet income for the fourth quarter skyrocketed by 201% to $14.02 billion, while the full-year net income saw a 69% increase to $39.10 billion. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $5.33, up 203%, and $14.87 for the full year, up 73%. These figures reflect Meta's successful cost management strategies, including an 8% decrease in total costs and expenses for the quarter.\nOperational efficiency was a key theme in Meta's latest earnings report. The company's headcount decreased by 22% year-over-year, and it completed several restructuring initiatives, including data center and employee layoffs, as well as facilities consolidation. These measures contributed to the reduction in costs and expenses and were reflected in the company's improved operating margin, which stood at 41% for Q4 and 35% for the full year.\nDespite these achievements, Meta is not without its challenges. The company's CFO outlook commentary highlighted expectations of increased operating losses for Reality Labs, driven by product development efforts in augmented and virtual reality. Additionally, Meta is facing regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S., which could significantly impact its business operations and financial results.\nMeta's balance sheet remains robust, with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $65.40 billion as of December 31, 2023. The company's long-term debt stood at $18.39 billion. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was reported at $11.50 billion, and $43.01 billion for the full year, indicating strong liquidity and financial health.\nThe company also announced a significant return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and the initiation of a quarterly dividend. Meta repurchased $6.32 billion of its Class A common stock in the fourth quarter and $20.03 billion for the full year. Furthermore, the board declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share, marking the company's commitment to delivering shareholder value.\nAs Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) navigates the evolving digital landscape, its focus on AI and the metaverse, along with its operational discipline, positions the company for continued growth. However, investors and stakeholders will be closely monitoring how the company addresses its challenges, particularly in the regulatory space, and how it capitalizes on its opportunities in the coming year.\nFor a detailed analysis of Meta's financial performance and future outlook, investors are encouraged to review the full 8-K filing and stay tuned to GuruFocus.com for the latest financial news and expert insights.\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Meta Platforms Inc for further details.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "By Samrhitha A, Aishwarya Venugopal and Chuck Mikolajczak\n(Reuters) -Meta Platforms added $196 billion in stock market value on Friday, marking the biggest one-day gain by any company in Wall Street history after the Facebook parent declared its first dividend and posted robust results.\nMeta's stock surged 20.3% for the session, also recording its biggest one-day percentage increase in a year and its third biggest since its 2012 Wall Street debut. Its stock market value now stands at more than $1.22 trillion.\nDays ahead of Facebook's 20th anniversary, Meta late on Thursday authorized an additional $50 billion in share repurchases and said its quarterly dividend would be 50 cents per share.\nWhile dividends are associated with mature, slow-growth companies, Meta's is the fourth offered by Wall Street's most valuable technology-related heavyweights, along with Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia.\n\"Paying a dividend suggests the company wants to reboot its reputation and be taken more seriously. But ultimately the amount being paid is only a token gesture,\" said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell.\nFriday's increase in Meta's market capitalization eclipsed the previous record held by Amazon, which saw its market value surge by $190 billion on Feb. 4, 2022 following a blowout quarterly report. One day before, Meta lost over $200 billion in value, the biggest loss in U.S. stock market history, after it issued a dismal forecast.\nMeta's dividend plan means a hefty payout for CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who owns about 350 million Meta Class A and Class B shares. The Facebook co-founder could get about $175 million every quarter.\nOptimism about the potential for artificial intelligence contributed to a 24% rally in the S&P 500 last year, with Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft and Broadcom recently hitting record highs. With Friday's gain, Meta is now up 35% in 2024.\nThe world's biggest social media company flagged strong ad sales and a rebound in user growth during its fourth-quarter results that saw its revenue surge 25%. Its forecast for current-quarter revenue also exceeded analysts' estimates.\nSurging revenue, combined with an 8% drop in costs and expenses after eliminating more than 21,000 jobs since late 2022, allowed Meta to triple its net income to $14.02 billion.\n\"The 'Year of Efficiency' has paid off, with both headcount and costs dropping, and Meta exceeding our expectations for full-year 2023 ad revenue,\" said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.\nWhile Meta's dividend is small compared to many companies, it could make its stock more attractive to a broader swathe of investors, including exchange-traded funds focused on stocks that pay dividends.\nMeta's dividend yield is about 0.4% following Friday's stock rally. By comparison, Apple's dividend yield is about 0.5%, while Microsoft's is 0.7% and Nvidia's is under 0.1%, according to LSEG.\n\"This can start attracting investors who really do look for dividends and more steady income,\" said Brian Jacobsen, Chief Economist at Annex Wealth Management.\nExchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that are focused on U.S. dividend payers have assets of over $400 billion, accounting for just over 5% of the entire domestic ETF universe, according to data from Morningstar Direct.\nMeta has been spending billions of dollars over the past decade to boost its computing capacity for generative AI products it is adding to Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, and to hardware devices such as its Ray-Ban smart glasses.\n(Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal and Samrhitha Arunasalam in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Medha Singh, Akash Sriram and Yuvraj Malik; Writing and additional reporting by Noel Randewich in Oakland, Calif.; Editing by Alden Bentley, Shounak Dasgupta, David Gregorio, Kirsten Donovan and Deepa Babington)\n"

        "Author": "  Eleanor Pringle ",
        "Text": "The year 2024 is off to a good start for Mark Zuckerberg, and the rest of it looks like it will be just as sweet, courtesy of a dividend payout of $700 million across the next four quarters.\nOn Meta\u2019s earnings call this week, chief financial officer Susan Li confirmed a regular dividend would now be paid out to shareholders each quarter, subject to board approval and market conditions.\nLi explained Meta was keen to return capital to shareholders while maintaining investment in the company, which it has typically achieved via share buybacks. However as well as announcing buybacks\u2014to the tune of $20 billion for full year of 2023\u2014Li added the company wanted to \u201cmodestly evolve\u201d its return to shareholders.\nFor CEO Zuckerberg, who holds some 350 million shares in the Big Tech giant, according to Bloomberg, a 50-cent-per Class A and B stock dividend means a payout in the region of $175 million per quarter from March onwards.\nSome simple math spits out an eye-watering figure, with Zuckerberg set to rake in $700 million across the year should the dividend level stay at 50 cents.\nHowever the good news for Zuckerberg\u2019s fortunes don\u2019t stop there. The father of three, estimated by Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index to be worth $142 billion, is also getting further boosts courtesy of the company\u2019s strong share price.\nIn the past year alone Meta\u2019s share price has rocketed more than 100% to sit close to $400 at the time of writing.\nAnd Wall Street could be set to boost it further, as analysts were buoyed by the group\u2019s earnings call on Feb. 1. Zuckerberg kicked off the call by feeding back on the results of his \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d which included layoffs and hiring freezes.\nZuckerberg told analysts on the call that Meta had achieved the level of efficiency it had aimed for\u2014the business\u2019s headcount is down 22% compared with a year ago, now at just over 67,000\u2014adding: \u201cBeing a leaner company is helping us execute better and faster, and we will continue to carry these values forward as a permanent part of how we operate.\u201d\nBut everyone\u2019s new favorite buzzword also had the desired effect on share price. The term \u201cAI\u201d was used more than 80 times by Meta staffers on the call\u2014a move that has proved something of a surefire way to pique the interest of investors.\nMicrosoft cofounder Bill Gates, for example, saw his wealth spike by $2 billion last spring after Microsoft mentioned artificial intelligence more than 50 times on its earnings call.\nCourtesy of the positive picture Zuckerberg and his team had for analysts\u2014and the clear show of focus on the emerging technology\u2014Meta\u2019s share price shot up in the hours following the announcement, boosting it by 14% in this year to date.\nOutside of AI excitement, Meta posted a 25% increase in revenue compared with the same period the previous year, up to $40.11 billion compared with $32.1 billion for Q4 2022. This resulted in a 16% full-year increase from the prior 12 months, up to $134.9 billion from $116.6 billion.\nDespite the rise of rival social media apps like TikTok, daily active users across Meta platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Threads were up 8% year on year, with ad impressions up 28%.\nA further boon for investors is the authorization of yet more share buybacks\u2014potentially upping the price of the stocks further\u2014with the company announcing an additional $50 billion repurchase authorization.\nMeta did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Katie Paul ",
        "Text": "By Katie Paul, Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n(Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms plans to deploy into its data centers this year a new version of a custom chip aimed at supporting its artificial intelligence (AI) push, according to an internal company document seen by Reuters on Thursday.\nThe chip, a second generation of an in-house silicon line Meta announced last year, could help to reduce Meta's dependence on the Nvidia chips that dominate the market and control the spiraling costs associated with running AI workloads as it races to launch AI products.\nThe world's biggest social media company has been scrambling to boost its computing capacity for the power-hungry generative AI products it is pushing into apps Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp and hardware devices like its Ray-Ban smartglasses, spending billions of dollars to amass arsenals of specialized chips and reconfigure data centers to accommodate them.\nAt the scale at which Meta operates, a successful deployment of its own chip could potentially shave off hundreds of millions of dollars in annual energy costs and billions in chip purchasing costs, according to Dylan Patel, founder of the silicon research group SemiAnalysis.\nThe chips, infrastructure and energy required to run AI applications has become a giant sinkhole of investment for tech companies, to some degree offsetting gains made in the rush of excitement around the technology.\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed the plan to put the updated chip into production in 2024, saying it would work in coordination with the hundreds of thousands of off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs) - the go-to chips for AI - the company was buying.\n\"We see our internally developed accelerators to be highly complementary to commercially available GPUs in delivering the optimal mix of performance and efficiency on Meta-specific workloads,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last month said the company planned to have by the end of the year roughly 350,000 flagship \"H100\" processors from Nvidia, which produces the most sought-after GPUs used for AI. Combined with other suppliers, Meta would accumulate the equivalent compute capacity of 600,000 H100s in total, he said.\nThe deployment of its own chip as part of that plan is a positive turn for Meta's in-house AI silicon project, after a decision by executives in 2022 to pull the plug on the chip's first iteration.\nThe company instead opted to buy billions of dollars worth of Nvidia's GPUs, which have a near monopoly on an AI process called training that involves feeding enormous data sets into models to teach them how to perform tasks.\nThe new chip, referred to internally as \"Artemis,\" like its predecessor can perform only a process known as inference in which the models are called on to use their algorithms to make ranking judgments and generate responses to user prompts.\nReuters last year reported that Meta is also working on a more ambitious chip that, like GPUs, would be capable of performing both training and inference.\nThe Menlo Park, California-based company shared details about the first generation of its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) program last year. The announcement portrayed that version of the chip as a learning opportunity.\nDespite those early stumbles, an inference chip could be considerably more efficient at crunching Meta's recommendation models than the energy thirsty Nvidia processors, according to Patel.\n\"There is a lot of money and power being spent that could be saved,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York and Stephen Nellis and Max A.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Could Easily Take On More Debt",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of December 2023 Meta Platforms had US$18.4b of debt, an increase on US$9.92b, over one year. But it also has US$65.4b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$47.0b net cash.\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Meta Platforms had liabilities of US$32.0b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$44.5b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$65.4b in cash and US$16.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it can boast US$5.12b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nThis state of affairs indicates that Meta Platforms' balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the US$1.23t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Succinctly put, Meta Platforms boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\nOn top of that, Meta Platforms grew its EBIT by 46% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Meta Platforms can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Meta Platforms may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, Meta Platforms produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 79% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Meta Platforms has net cash of US$47.0b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And it impressed us with its EBIT growth of 46% over the last year. So we don't think Meta Platforms's use of debt is risky. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms that you should be aware of before investing here.\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

His efforts in the sport were recognized when he won gold and silver medals at a Brazilian jiu-jitsu tournament in May.\nHis dedication to these pursuits was underscored last November when he sustained a torn ACL during a mixed martial arts training session, a mishap he shared with his followers on Instagram. The post featured Zuckerberg in a hospital bed, his left leg wrapped and secured in a brace, evidence that his ventures often come at a price.\nZuckerberg\u2019s enthusiasm extends to surfing, an activity that, despite his earnest participation, has drawn playful critique from online communities.\nTrending: \nThis startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents \u2013 what\u2019s the catch?\nCopy and paste Mark Cuban\u2019s startup investment strategy according to his colorful portfolio.\nShowcasing his zeal for pushing boundaries, Zuckerberg has ventured into aviation, pursuing a pilot\u2019s license.

It notes that if the worst happens, \"there could be a material adverse impact on our [Meta's] operations.\"\nThe filing added, \"We currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg.\"\nMeta hasn't spoken about its decision to add this warning to its most recent 10-K.

        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) appears to be back in the good graces of Wall Street after its stock price recently surpassed all-time highs set back in mid-2021. Investors piled back into the stock following the release of the company's fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 report. The introduction of a dividend also seemed to improve the sentiment surrounding this stock.\nOn the other hand, the rising price (it's up 212% in the past year) has made Meta stock increasingly expensive, and investors may lose interest in the dividend when they see what it yields.\nWhile such factors are unlikely to prevent Meta's long-term growth, they could contribute to returns that fail to beat the S&P 500 -- at least in the near term. Here's why.\nThe social media giant's latest results show why many analysts characterize Meta Platforms as a \"Magnificent Seven\" stock. Meta managed to recover from its metaverse-related misstep, increasing more than 300% since its October 2022 low. This has taken its market cap back above $1 trillion, a feat few tech stocks have accomplished.\nMeta dominates social media with its ownership of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. About 3.2 billion people use at least one of its apps daily, a figure no other social media company can come close to matching.\nFor the full-year 2023, Meta reported $135 billion in revenue, a 16% increase from year-ago results. At the same time, its expenses rose just 1%. This resulted in net income of just over $39 billion, an improvement of 69% from year-ago levels.\nAs already mentioned, Meta investors will now receive a dividend. The first quarterly payout of $0.50 per share ($2 per share yearly) will become payable on March 26. Given the 2.57 billion outstanding shares, the dividend will cost Meta just under $5.2 billion annually. Fortunately, the company generated $43 billion in free cash flow in 2023, an amount that can easily cover the cost of the payout.\nUnfortunately, income-focused investors are likely to lose enthusiasm for the payout when they discover its dividend yield is just over 0.4%, well under the 1.4% average for the S&P 500. At such levels, investors may treat the payout as an afterthought rather than a reason to own shares. In Meta's defense, part of why the payout yields so little is that the stock price has appreciated so much in such a short time.\nThe 15-month run-up in the stock has made it look quite frothy. At a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) exceeding 35, the earnings multiple is approaching five-year highs, a dramatic turnaround from when it reached single digits in the fall of 2022.\nFurthermore, Meta management delivered an outlook that was mixed, at best. For Q1 2024, it forecast revenue of $34.5 billion to $37 billion. That points to a healthy 25% revenue growth rate at the midpoint. However, it declined to publish a revenue outlook for all of 2024, instead revealing to investors that 2024 expenses would rise due to higher infrastructure costs, wage expenses, and more operating losses for its metaverse segment, Reality Labs. Such expense growth makes it unlikely for 2024 profits to rise as much as they did in 2023, assuming they increase at all.\nMeta released strong results and showed it's moved on from earlier missteps into the metaverse. It's the dominant social media company and has robust free cash flow, so the company's stock price should grow in the longer term.\nHowever, new investors may want to wait for a more opportune time to buy in. And income investors are likely to feel underwhelmed by the dividend when they see how much it yields. Additionally, rising expenses and the lack of revenue transparency for 2024 point to uncertainty. With Meta's P/E ratio near a five-year high, it may be worthwhile to hold out for a lower valuation before buying this stock.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\nBelow, we take a look at Meta Platforms (META), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Meta Platforms currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\nSet to Beat the Market?\nIn order to see if META is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this social media company holds up.\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\nFor META, shares are up 20.51% over the past week while the Zacks Internet - Software industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 27.14% compares favorably with the industry's 0.91% performance as well.\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Meta Platforms have increased 40.64% over the past quarter, and have gained 164.16% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 14.46% and 23.05%, respectively.\nInvestors should also pay attention to META's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. META is currently averaging 21,937,472 shares for the last 20 days.\nEarnings Outlook\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with META.\nOver the past two months, 13 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost META's consensus estimate, increasing from $17.64 to $19.62 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 9 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\nBottom Line\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that META is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Meta Platforms on your short list.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Katie Paul and Yuvraj Malik ",
        "Text": "By Katie Paul and Yuvraj Malik\n(Reuters) -Meta Platforms issued its first dividend days ahead of flagship social network Facebook's 20th anniversary, while reporting revenue and profit that beat expectations on robust ad sales in the holiday shopping period.\nShares soared more than 14% after the bell, pushing the company's stock market valuation up by more than $140 billion and extending a long recovery that saw Meta hit record highs in recent weeks for the first time in more than two years.\nThe after-hours gains alone amounted to more than quintuple the entire value of social media rival Snap Inc.\nMeta, one of the tech sector's original unicorns, said its dividend would be 50 cents per share. It also announced it had authorized an additional $50 billion in share repurchases.\nThe social media giant is the first of its generation of internet juggernauts to issue a dividend, a milestone for a tech sector that has been dominated by the same handful of companies for well over a decade.\nFounded in a college dorm room in 2004, it has grown into the world's biggest social media company, connecting more than 3 billion people and revolutionizing how they discover trends, communicate with their neighbors and engage with politics.\nThe company, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, has also been accused of ignoring a multitude of harms on its path to growth, including violations of user privacy and incitements to violence.\nJust a day before announcing results, CEO Mark Zuckerberg was called to testify before the U.S. Senate about child safety online and compelled to apologize to parents of children who had experienced sexual abuses.\n\"You're never as good as they say when you're up, or as bad as they say when you're down. Just keep building and doing good work over long periods of time,\" he said on Thursday in a post on another Meta-owned app, Threads.\nIMPRESSIVE QUARTER\nShares of Meta have steadily been climbing back this past year from a meltdown in 2022 that wiped out more than three-quarters of their one-time value, buoyed by investor excitement about artificial intelligence.\nIts recovery has also been aided by a rebound in user growth and digital ad sales, as well as an austerity drive that saw it shed more than 21,000 employees since late 2022.\nRevenue for the fourth quarter rose 25% to $40.1 billion, above the $39.2 billion analysts were expecting, according to LSEG data.\nNet income rose more than 200% to $14 billion, or $5.33 per share, exceeding expectations of $4.97 per share, according to LSEG data.\n\"This was one of the most impressive quarters \u2013 intrinsically and vs. expectations,\" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney.\nMeta forecast first quarter revenue of $34.5 billion to $37 billion, above Wall Street expectations of $33.8 billion. It said it expects full-year 2024 total expenses to be unchanged at $94 billion to $99 billion.\nThose results came after fellow digital ads heavyweight Alphabet posted holiday season advertising sales that came in below expectations.\nMORE METAVERSE, AI INVESTMENTS\nImprovements to the social media business have made investors more tolerant of Meta's undiminished spending, as it pours billions of dollars into \"metaverse\" technologies and building out its artificial intelligence infrastructure.\nOn Thursday executives doubled down on aggressive investments in both areas.\nThe company's metaversee-oriented Reality Labs unit handily beat revenue expectations for the fourth quarter, posting record sales of $1.1 billion from \"strong sales\" of its Quest device over the holiday season, Zuckerberg told analysts after the report. Investors had been expecting $804 million, according to LSEG data.\nMeta said it still expected operating losses for Reality Labs to \"increase meaningfully\" as it invests more in augmented and virtual reality in 2024.\nWhile interactive and immersive experiences via those technologies remain the ultimate goal, Zuckerberg said the latest version of its Ray-Ban smart glasses, with a built-in AI assistant, has been an early surprise hit with consumers too.\n\"We thought we would have to build full displays and holograms\" before the smart glasses would become mainstream, he said. \"And now it's quite possible that ... AI assistants built in will be the killer app.\"\nStill, though improving, Reality Labs sales remain a tiny 2.7% slice of the company's total revenue.\n\"Meta ended 2023 on an extremely strong note, with revenue soaring above analyst expectations,\" said Debra Aho Williamson, an independent tech analyst and former principal analyst at eMarketer.\n\"The company can talk all it wants to about AI and the metaverse, but it's still a social media company that gets nearly all its revenue from advertising, and advertisers still clearly love Meta.\"\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York and Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Sheila Dang in Austin and Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Stephen Coates)\n"

        "Title": "Meta's Dividend Is Emphatically Not a Reason to Buy the Stock -- but This Is",
        "Author": "  Keith Speights, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Let's welcome Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) to the dividend club. Last week, the company announced that it's initiating a quarterly dividend for the first time.\nThe news was warmly received by investors. So was Meta's overall fourth-quarter update: Shares skyrocketed more than 20% on the heels of the company's earnings release. Meta's dividend is emphatically not a reason to buy the stock -- but there's something that is.\nThere were multiple articles published after Meta's Q1 update last week with headlines trumpeting that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will receive nearly $700 million per year from the company's new dividend. Those headlines were correct. However, they can also lead you to think that Meta's dividend is better than it actually is.\nZuckerberg will make a boatload of dividend income because he owns a boatload of Meta Platforms shares. Meta's dividend payout isn't anything to get excited about, though.\nThe company's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share. On an annualized basis, that translates to a dividend of $2 and a yield of roughly 0.44%.\nThis puts Meta's dividend yield in the bottom 10% of all dividend stocks. Meta also comes in next to last among its megacap tech peers with dividend programs. Only Nvidia has a lower dividend yield (a measly 0.023%).\nIf you're looking for a compelling reason to buy Meta stock, the dividend just ain't it. There is a great reason to buy the stock, though: Meta offers investors a highly attractive risk-reward proposition.\nLet's first address the company's risks. Competition from other social media platforms certainly ranks high on the list. So does the potential threat from regulatory investigations. Meta faces risks with its investments in developing new technologies as well.\nHowever, even with rivals such as TikTok gaining ground, Meta's social media platforms still attracted a whopping 3.19 billion people on average every day in 2023's Q4, up from the previous quarter. I'm not saying that the company shouldn't take its competitors seriously, but I don't see anything to get overly concerned about on this front.\nPerhaps Meta could get dinged with a hefty fine by regulators looking into potential antitrust matters and privacy issues. I'd be shocked, though, if the outcome is more severe than that.\nThat leads us to Meta's investments in developing new technologies. Although there is certainly a risk that the company could fail, my view is that the likelihood of some measure of success is even greater.\nZuckerberg revealed in the Q1 conference call that Meta is actively working on \"building full general intelligence\" -- his description of what most AI experts call artificial general intelligence (AGI). I predict that Meta's AGI efforts will pay off big-time.\nHe also reaffirmed Meta's commitment to developing the metaverse. The company still expects that it might take a decade or so to achieve its metaverse vision. However, Zuckerberg stated that he thinks that smart glasses with AI assistants could be \"the killer app\" with a big market that arrives even earlier.\nSome investors are leery of the sky-high valuations of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Is valuation a problem for Meta? I don't think so.\nSure, Meta's shares trade at over 27.5 times forward earnings. That's certainly steep at first glance. However, it's important to factor in the company's growth prospects. Meta's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio (using analysts' 5-year growth projections) is only 1.07 times. That reflects an attractive valuation.\nGranted, those growth estimates could turn out to be wrong. If you're looking for a good reason to buy Meta stock, though, valuation shouldn't dissuade you from doing so.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Meta Platforms (META)",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\nMeta Platforms (META) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this social media company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings Growth\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 17.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 31.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 24.2%.\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.64, which means that the company gets $0.64 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.56, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Meta Platforms looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 17.3% this year versus the industry average of 10.7%.\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 10.7% over the past month.\nBottom Line\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Meta Platforms a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Meta Platforms is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Corinne Dorsey ",
        "Text": "In the past year, Meta has undergone significant transformations, particularly in its approach to workforce management. Meta\u2019s decisions regarding layoffs have not only attracted attention but have had a substantial impact on the company\u2019s financial performance.\nMeta incurred staggering losses totaling $16 billion, primarily attributed to its Metaverse endeavors, mainly its Reality Labs division responsible for Oculus goggles. This marked a significant increase from the previous year\u2019s loss of $13.7 billion, with Meta reporting a loss of $4.6 billion in the final quarter of 2023. \nDespite these substantial deficits, Meta\u2019s stock surged by 12% following recent updates, largely due to the company\u2019s improved margins. Meta\u2019s revenue increased by 16%, while operating income and profits surged by 62% and 69%, respectively.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg has assured investors of further losses in the future due to ongoing investments in augmented reality/virtual reality expansion. The company has undertaken significant restructuring efforts, including office closures and layoffs, contributing to enhanced profitability.\nLast year, Meta allocated $3.5 billion towards downsizing operations, with $2.5 billion directed towards office consolidation and $1 billion towards severance and related personnel expenses. This resulted in a notable 22% reduction in its workforce to 67,300 employees.\u00a0\nMeta\u2019s approach to downsizing its workforce has been noteworthy, particularly in light of its soaring profits. The company\u2019s net income increased by 201% during the last quarter of 2023, reaching $14.02 billion. \nThis strategic restructuring aligns with broader industry trends, where tech giants aim to demonstrate continued profitability amidst ongoing investments in innovative ventures. Furthermore, Meta\u2019s focus on efficiency and innovation remains central to its long-term strategy. By redirecting resources previously allocated to staff towards AI investments, including substantial purchases of GPUs from Nvidia, Meta is positioning itself for ongoing tech innovation.\n"

        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The rise of the internet has led to game-changing innovations and the growth of massive businesses. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is one such company.\nThe social media and digital advertising behemoth is one of the most valuable businesses in the world. And during its ascent, it has rewarded shareholders. If you were smart enough to invest $10,000 in this FAANG stock 10 years ago in February 2014, you'd be sitting on a balance of $75,900 today, good for a monster 659% gain.\nLet's look at Meta's path to get to this point, and then consider where the company might be headed.\nFormerly known as Facebook, Meta benefited from some key tech breakthroughs on its journey. The mainstream adoption of smartphones, coupled with faster internet connectivity, helped this business gain a huge number of users as the world shifted from PCs to mobile devices.\nBetween 2013 and 2023, Meta's daily active users (across all of its apps) skyrocketed from 757 million to 3.19 billion. This means that now about 39% of the global population interacts with the company in some way each day. That's a wild statistic.\nThe success of the social media apps has resulted in powerful network effects. As more users interact with each other or post more content, it makes it more compelling for new people to join. Consequently, there's very little chance that Meta will get disrupted anytime soon.\nSocial media undoubtedly remains Meta's bread and butter. But founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is always thinking of the next step. His focus over the past few years has been leaning more toward metaverse ambitions and the development of a new computing platform. This is what the Reality Labs division is working on.\nSo far, the results have been disappointing. In 2024, this segment posted a staggering operating loss of $16.1 billion on revenue of just $1.9 billion. There's no reason to believe things are going to drastically improve anytime soon.\nHowever, it makes sense that Zuckerberg is investing in this technology. He hopes to one day have a billion people spending money in the metaverse, with the ultimate goal of depending less and less on the top mobile operating systems, Apple's iOS and Alphabet's Android. If Meta controls the devices that people use to interact with the internet of tomorrow, it could prove to be a huge growth engine.\nIt's anyone's guess if the metaverse will become a moneymaker for the business one day, but luckily Meta has the financial resources to continue pushing the envelope forward in terms of innovation. This is one of the most profitable companies on the face of the planet.\nMeta's operating margin was 40% in 2021, then it contracted to 25% in 2022. Last year, Zuckerberg embarked on a \"Year of Efficiency,\" and so the margin expanded to 35%. \nThis is a cash machine. The business generated $43 billion of free cash flow last year, helping to fund ongoing share repurchases. But for the first time ever, Meta announced a $0.50 quarterly dividend payout, which would add a tiny bump to investor returns. This reinforces my belief that the company is in a very strong financial position.\nMeta is clearly one of the most dominant and profitable enterprises ever.

        "Text": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta will pay up to $50bn to shareholders after it posted record revenues, sending profits soaring by 200pc.\nRevenues at the social media giant behind Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp hit more than $40bn for the three months to December. Its shares surged more than 13pc in after hours trading on Thursday night.\nQuarterly profits climbed threefold to $14bn as Meta\u2019s advertising sales staged a marked recovery after it implemented sweeping layoffs last year in a drastic effort to cut costs. Meta\u2019s workforce shrunk by a total of 22pc, equivalent to more than 19,000 staff.\nMr Zuckerberg also announced the social network giant, which turns 20 this month, would pay its first-ever dividend as a public company of 50 cents per share - worth a total of $1.25bn. Meta said it would begin regular dividend payouts for the first time and would also buy back an additional $50bn from shareholders.\nThe strong results came just days after Mr Zuckerberg was accused by US senators of putting profits before users\u2019 safety.\nEmails from within Meta published ahead of a Senate hearing this week showed how Mr Zuckerberg rejected pleas from Sir Nick Clegg, the company\u2019s head of global affairs, to hire dozens of staff to help protect children on Facebook and Instagram.\nMr Zuckerberg told investors on Thursday: \u201cWe had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.\u201d\nMeta revealed close to half the world\u2019s population has signed up to join the social media empire, with nearly 4bn people now using at least one of its apps on a regular basis.\nWhile politicians have threatened a crackdown on social media apps, Meta\u2019s shares have climbed to record highs so far in 2024, up 14pc. Meta is now worth more than $1 trillion.\nSeparately on Thursday night, Apple revealed its first rise in sales in more than a year as demand for its latest iPhones reversed a rare losing streak.\nThe tech giant revealed that revenues rose by 2pc in the final three months of last year to $119.6bn while profits rose by 13pc to $34bn.\nThe increase reverses four consecutive quarters of falling revenues, which had been Apple\u2019s longest losing streak since the launch of the iPod two decades ago.\nIt comes despite declining sales in China, where the company has faced growing questions over its business.\nShares in the company dropped slightly in after-hours trading.\nSales of the iPhone, which counts for the majority of Apple\u2019s revenue, grew by 6pc. Its services business, which includes its App Store and software such as Apple Music and Apple Pay, grew by 11pc. Sales of the iPad fell while those of Mac computers rose slightly. Sales of accessories such as AirPods and the Apple Watch also declined.\nChief executive Tim Cook said 2.2bn Apple products were now in use around the world\nThe figures come as Apple prepares to release its Vision Pro headset, the most significant new product released in Mr Cook\u2019s 13 years in charge of the company, which goes on sale on Friday in the US.\nAmazon recorded its highest profit for two years amid a jump in trading over the Christmas period.\nThe company said sales rose by 14pc to $170bn in the fourth quarter of the year, in part due to growing sales outside the US.\nProfits rose from $300m a year ago to $10.6bn. This was its strongest profit since the end of 2021, when rising Covid cases meant most consumers resorted to internet shopping.\nThe growth in sales puts Amazon within touching distance of overtaking Walmart as the world\u2019s biggest retail company by revenues.\nShares rose by 6pc in after-hours trading.\nThe results for the Silicon Valley giants came as job cuts continued to hit the industry. Video call app Zoom cut around 150 jobs, roughly 2pc of its workforce, while security app Okta laid off 400 staff.\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

        "Title": "Meta Just Announced a Dividend. Could Alphabet Be Next?",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stunned investors on Thursday with a blowout fourth-quarter earnings report. The social media giant breezed past estimates on the top and bottom lines and offered better-than-expected guidance for the first quarter, forecasting another round of 25% year-over-year revenue growth. By the end of trading on Friday, the stock had jumped 20.3%, adding more than $200 billion in market cap. That's the biggest single-day market cap gain for an individual U.S. stock in history.\nOne reason for those gains is that Meta announced its first-ever dividend. Management said it would pay a $0.50 per share quarterly dividend on March 26 to shareholders of record on Feb. 22. That gives the stock a dividend yield of 0.4% at the current share price.\nThe dividend was a surprise since there had been little expectation that Meta would initiate a regular payout especially as the company was facing challenges just a few quarters ago with revenue and profits declining.\nOn Meta's earnings call, chief financial officer Susan Li explained the move, saying that returning capital to shareholders remains important to the company, and \"We believe our strong financial position and performance will enable us to invest in the business while also continuing to return capital to investors over time.\"\nLooking at Meta's finances, the decision seems like a no-brainer. Meta has $65 billion in cash and marketable securities, and it just finished a year when it generated $39.1 billion in net income and $44 billion in free cash flow.\nHistorically, the company has returned capital to shareholders through share buybacks, and it returned $20 billion that way in 2023. However, rewarding them with a dividend makes sense as it gives existing shareholders a way to benefit from that return without selling the stock. The dividend will cost the company approximately $5 billion a year.\nWith Meta initiating a dividend, it's only natural to ask which of the big tech stocks will be next, and one of Meta's peers seems like an obvious choice: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\nIn many ways, Alphabet is like a larger version of Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook). The Google parent is the older of the two companies, and the two companies have been ranked No. 1 or No. 2 in digital advertising since the industry's early days.\nAlphabet also seems to have more cash than it knows what to do with. It finished 2023 with $111 billion in cash and marketable securities, more than it had in total liabilities. Last year, the company generated $73.8 billion in net income and $69.5 billion in free cash flow.\nThere's been no discussion of an Alphabet dividend, and it's not something that activist investors have demanded, but it is something the tech giant could clearly afford if it chose to pay one.\nIn addition to the direct cash distribution, there's another less obvious benefit to paying a dividend. For companies like Alphabet and Meta, which generate boatloads of cash each quarter, paying a dividend also acts as a guardrail on spending and a pledge to shareholders that they are getting some share of profits.\nIn the case of these two companies, it seems like they could use a guardrail. Besides their highly profitable advertising businesses, both companies lose billions on moonshot projects each year.\nAlphabet classifies these as \"other bets,\" which include its Waymo autonomous vehicle business; Verily life sciences business; and Google Fiber broadband business, among others. Meta's money-losing business is Reality Labs, its new segment focused on AI and the metaverse.\nGoogle is also notorious for over-hiring, overspending on projects, and being plagued by risk aversion. For example, the company has an internal term for developing technologies that it saves for later (\"pantry mode\"), which explains the company's cautiousness in AI.\nA commitment to returning cash to shareholders through dividends would not only reward investors, but it would also help give the company some needed discipline on expenses.\nIt's not surprising that Meta's decision to start paying a dividend came after its highly successful \"Year of Efficiency,\" and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's declaration that \"We operate better as a leaner company.\"\nThat realization dovetails with its decision to initiate a dividend as well.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Alex Barinka ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. announced plans to buy back an additional $50 billion in shares and issue its first-ever quarterly dividend as Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg works to convince investors that his costly bets on the metaverse and artificial intelligence will pay off.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Denied Immunity in DC Election Case by Appeals Court\nXi to Discuss China Stocks With Regulators as Rescue Bets Build\nWall Street Snubs China for India in a Historic Markets Shift\n\u2018Money Dysmorphia\u2019 Traps Millennials and Gen Zers\nKing Charles Treated for Cancer in New Royal Health Scare\nThe social media giant also reported strong fourth-quarter results, posting a 25% gain in sales and profits that tripled, while also projecting revenue growth for the current period that surpassed projections.\nThe shares jumped more than 14% in extended trading. The stock had gained 12% this year through Thursday\u2019s close after nearly tripling last year.\n\u201cWe had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.\u201d\nRevenue is expected to be as much as $37 billion in the three months ending in March, Meta said. Analysts were looking for $33.6 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $40.1 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $39 billion. Net income surged to $14 billion, or $5.33 a share, also better than expected.\nMeta executives had cautioned in October that \u201cglobal economic uncertainties\u201d could weigh on revenue at the end of last year, typically the most lucrative quarter, even as the company laid out an expensive spending plan for 2024. But the social media company, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, fared better than Alphabet Inc. The Google parent, which, like Meta, gets the bulk of its revenue from digital advertising and is also investing heavily on AI, reported softness in its core search advertising business earlier this week, sending its stock tumbling.\n\u201cIn the digital advertising sphere, Meta\u2019s outlook is increasingly optimistic,\u201d said Mayuranki De, research analyst at Global X. \u201cDespite diversifying into areas like virtual-reality headsets, digital advertising remains its revenue cornerstone.\u201d\nChief Financial Officer Susan Li said the strong increase in revenue in the fourth quarter was due to high spending by China-based advertisers and AI-recommended video content. Daily watch time across the company\u2019s apps increased 25% from a year earlier.\nIn 2023, revenue from China-based advertisers represented 10% of Meta\u2019s total revenue and contributed 5 percentage points to total worldwide revenue growth, Li said on a call with analysts.\nIn recent years, Meta has been working to balance huge outlays on technologies like artificial intelligence and virtual reality, while still trying to ensure that its core digital advertising business is still growing. After seeing business shrink for the first time in 2022, Zuckerberg made efforts to turn the company around, dubbing 2023 the \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d and cutting thousands of jobs.\n\u201cThe fruits of their cost cutting measures are starting really to shine through earnings,\u201d analysts at Vital Knowledge wrote in a note.\nZuckerberg struggled to get investors on board the last time he laid out a long-term, expensive new vision \u2014 for the metaverse \u2014 going so far as to change the company\u2019s name from Facebook to Meta. Now, as the company spends handily on VR and AI, the company is sweetening the bet for shareholders with a quarterly dividend of 50 cents a share and a huge share repurchase program. The last time Meta authorized a buyback of this size was in October 2021 when it was still posting surprising growth in the number of people actively using its network of social media apps.\nNow that Meta plans to pay a dividend, the only holdouts among peers valued at more than $1 trillion are Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. Apple Inc. has paid dividends on and off since 1987, and Microsoft Corp. started doling out dividends in 2003.\nMeta\u2019s move sends a signal about the company\u2019s view of its potential. While it indicates management are bullish about growth prospects, it also hints at limits on what the company can do with its cash pile. Typically, faster growing tech companies eschew dividends in favor of using earnings to develop new products or make big acquisitions. While Meta is spending big on artificial intelligence initiatives, its acquisition prospects are dwindling in the face of regulatory opposition.\nMeta has been investing in AI technology at record levels, including expanding its core advertising business through improvements in ad targeting and AI-recommended content, and the infrastructure it needs to run it. At the same time, it hasn\u2019t abandoned efforts to build the virtual reality metaverse.\nFor this year, Meta plans to spend $94 billion to $99 billion, covering higher infrastructure-related costs, hiring selectively in higher-cost technical roles and development in augmented and virtual reality. Last quarter, the company said it planned to push some spending on items like new headcount and infrastructure into 2024.\nZuckerberg said he\u2019s developed an appreciation for operating a leaner company, and is reluctant to jump back into significant hiring. He said he\u2019d like to keep new hires \u201crelatively minimal\u201d to stay lean.\nThe company also said it expects operating losses to \u201cincrease meaningfully\u201d at Reality Labs, the division that makes smart glasses and headsets, as it continues to invest in product development. On the bright side, the unit crossed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time.\nMeta\u2019s results follow reports from other Big Tech rivals, including Microsoft Corp., which failed to convince Wall Street that the all-consuming and expensive focus on AI is starting to pay off yet.\nMeta\u2019s approach to the AI race has been different than its peers, however. For the most part, it\u2019s unveiling research or large language models \u2014 the technology that underpins AI chatbots \u2014 for free to be used by developers. Meta thinks this open strategy will help improve the technology faster.\nFor all of Meta\u2019s excitement about AI, investors focus on the number of people who use its apps has faded. Now with almost 4 billion people across Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp that use the platform each month, the San Francisco-based company said it will no longer report that metric in earnings, or daily and monthly user numbers for its flagship Facebook app.\nBeginning this quarter, the company will instead begin reporting year-over-year changes in ad impressions and the average price per ad at the regional level, while continuing to report only daily active users across its family of apps.\nReels \u2013 the vertical videos on Instagram and Facebook that are served up to users by an algorithm \u2013 are being re-shared 3.5 billion times a day, Zuckerberg said, and ads for that format are now contributing to net revenue across both apps. Continuing to improve those videos, the ads served there and the algorithm that personalizes them for users, will continue to \u201cremain a priority,\u201d he said\n--With assistance from Kurt Wagner.\n(Updates to add user numbers, comments from CFO, CEO)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong\nThe Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) headed in opposite directions after their latest earnings reports. Meta's stock soared 20% to an all-time high on Feb. 2, after the social media giant followed up its big fourth-quarter earnings beat with rosy guidance for the first quarter, a $50 billion boost to its buyback plan, and the initiation of its first-ever dividend. Alphabet's stock sank 8% on Jan. 31, even though its fourth-quarter numbers easily cleared analysts' expectations with double-digit growth across its core businesses.\nAs of this writing, Meta's stock has rallied more than 150% over the past 12 months. Alphabet's stock has rallied just over 30%. Let's see why the bulls rushed to Meta instead of Alphabet -- and if that trend will continue throughout the rest of 2024.\nMeta and Alphabet both generate most of their revenue from digital ads, but their business models are different. Meta is the world's largest social media company, and 3.98 billion people use at least one of its core apps -- Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- every month. It sells its ads across all four platforms, as well as its Audience Network for third-party apps and websites. It's also producing augmented and virtual reality devices through its Reality Labs segment.\nAlphabet's Google owns the world's largest search engine, the top streaming video platform in YouTube, and the most popular mobile operating system in Android. It also owns the world's third largest cloud infrastructure platform, sells its own first-party hardware devices, and develops self-driving vehicles through its Waymo subsidiary.\nGoogle and Facebook controlled 39% and 18% of the global digital advertising market in terms of annual revenue, respectively, in 2023. But both companies face stiff competition from ByteDance's TikTok, which claimed 3% of the market and continues to lock in younger audiences with its short videos. To counter TikTok, Google has been beefing up YouTube Shorts, while Meta has been expanding its similar Reels across Facebook and Instagram.\nMeta and Alphabet generated 98% and 77% of their revenue, respectively, from digital ads in 2023. Both companies struggled with slower ad sales in 2022, as the macro headwinds drove more businesses to rein their ad spending.\nMeta also struggled with Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) privacy changes on iOS, which made it tougher to craft targeted ads from third-party data. Google wasn't as affected by the iOS update, because it mainly relied on first-party data and already paid Apple billions of dollars each year to remain the default search engine on iOS. But despite all of those challenges, Meta's ad revenue grew at a much faster rate than Google's over the past year.\nMetric\nQ4 2022\nQ1 2023\nQ2 2023\nQ3 2023\nQ4 2023\nMeta ad revenue growth (YOY)\n(4%)\n4%\n12%\n24%\n24%\nGoogle ad revenue growth (YOY)\n(4%)\n0%\n3%\n9%\n11%\nData source: Company earnings reports. YOY = Year over year.\nMeta outperformed Google for three reasons. First, Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies significantly ramped up their spending on Facebook and Instagram to reach more overseas users. Second, Meta countered Apple's changes by gathering more first-party data and upgrading its AI algorithms. Lastly, its higher ad impressions offset its lower ad prices.\nGoogle didn't seem to attract as much spending from those Chinese companies, and declining impressions across its sprawling ad network partly offset its rising impressions across its core search engine and YouTube. Google's growing dependence on ad-free subscriptions for YouTube and YouTube Music also suggested its advertising business was running out of steam. Meanwhile, Google's closely watched cloud business continued to grow at a slower rate than its larger rival, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, which implied it was falling behind in the cutthroat cloud and AI race.\nMeta's rising ad revenue, layoffs, and other cost-cutting measures boosted its operating margin from 25% in 2022 to 35% in 2023, even as it ramped up its spending in its unprofitable Reality Labs business. Alphabet also executed several rounds of layoffs, but its operating margin rose from 26% in 2022 to just 27% in 2023.\nAnalysts expect Meta's revenue and earnings to grow 12% and 18%, respectively, in 2024. Based on those estimates, which might need to be raised after Meta's latest earnings beat, its stock doesn't look particularly expensive at 28 times forward earnings. Its forward yield of 0.4% won't attract any serious investors, but it's a clear sign that it can continue to generate a stable profit while expanding its metaverse ecosystem.\nAnalysts expect Alphabet's revenue and earnings to rise 11% and 17%, respectively, in 2024. It doesn't pay a dividend yet, but its stock looks a bit cheaper at 21 times forward earnings. However, concerns about its advertising business and its ability to keep pace with Microsoft in the AI race could continue to compress its near-term valuations.\nIt's a close call, but I believe Meta will continue to outperform Alphabet this year as its advertising growth accelerates and it expands its operating margin. Its simpler business model could also make it more appealing for growth-oriented investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company said Facebook's monthly users stood at 3.07 billion, 20 years after the platform was founded by Zuckerberg in a Harvard dorm.\nIn late 2021, Facebook changed its parent company name to Meta Platforms to reflect Zuckerberg's yet to be proven vision of a virtual world, referred to as the \"metaverse\", as the next major computing platform.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Text": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said only the best will be able to work at Meta after seeing good results from his \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d in 2023, and investors are already rewarding him for it.\nThe company\u2019s stock was up more than 21% after Meta reported a 25% jump in year-over-year revenue for the fourth quarter on Thursday. Partly fueling that increase may be Zuckerberg\u2019s commitment to a \u201cleaner\u201d operating structure, which he said will be \u201ca permanent part of how we operate going forward.\u201d\nA year ago, Zuckerberg announced his year of efficiency, explaining that the company was stopping what had been at that point headcount growth of 20% or 30% every year, after revenue showed negative growth for the first time in 2022. Thousands of layoffs later, the company\u2019s headcount shrank by 22% and Zuckerberg said the company has been able to \u201cexecute better and faster.\u201d\nIn a possible sign of future stability, or maturity and slower growth depending on who you ask, the company also announced its first cash dividend on Thursday, emulating other tech giants Microsoft and Apple. It also announced a $50 billion share buyback.\nAs for hiring, Zuckerberg said on Thursday\u2019s earnings call that the company will work through a \u201crecruiting backlog\u201d that has piled up in part owing to previous layoffs, but he added that new hires would be \u201crelatively minimal compared to what we would have done historically.\u201d\nAlready, the company has removed some layers of its management and has asked some managers to reapply for positions or be fired.\nZuckerberg said keeping things \u201clean\u201d is the best thing for the company to do culturally, and that making its efficiency changes permanent will help Meta weather \u201cwhat is a somewhat unpredictable and volatile period over the next five or 10 years.\u201d\nThe Meta CEO said the changes will help employees work faster in the near term and improve the company\u2019s performance in the years to come. For now, he\u2019s patting himself on the back.\n\u201cOur communities are growing, and our business is back on track,\u201d he said Thursday.\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Stock Split Watch: Is Meta Platforms Next?",
        "Author": "  Collin Brantmeyer, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "In recent years, stock splits have become increasingly frequent on Wall Street, with companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla joining the trend. While stock splits may not drastically alter a company's valuation, they can serve a purpose, including enticing more individual investors to buy shares at a lower price.\nOne tech company that hasn't participated so far is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), known for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. But with its shares trading near an all-time high, it could potentially benefit from a split. Let's explore further.\nA stock split is when a company increases the number of its outstanding shares while maintaining its market capitalization. This means that each existing shareholder receives more shares, but the total value of their investment remains unchanged.\nTo illustrate, let's say you're an investor holding 10 shares of a company valued at $100 each. If the company decides to execute a 2-for-1 stock split, your holdings would double to 20 shares, and the share price would halve to $50 each. It's important to underscore that a stock split doesn't alter the fundamental worth of your investment; instead, it adjusts the number of shares you possess. In this example, your investment was worth $1,000 before and after the stock split.\nWhen a company's stock, such as Meta Platforms, commands a high trading price, it may present a barrier to entry for certain investors. While fractional shares are readily accessible through many brokerage platforms, notable exceptions like Vanguard do not offer this option. In theory, a lower share price could enhance accessibility, potentially boosting demand for the company's shares and thereby increasing its market capitalization.\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has previously argued that a lower stock price helps a company's ability to both attract and retain talent, whether through equity compensation packages or employee stock purchase plans.\nA company's eligibility for inclusion in a price-weighted index -- such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is determined from an average of the share prices of all the companies -- can also be impeded by a higher stock price. As a result, stocks with higher prices, such as Meta, face a lower likelihood of being added, since their share prices could disproportionately skew the index.\nMeta Platforms has never split its stock since going public in early 2012 at $38 per share. For investors who have held on to their shares since then, the stock has delivered an impressive return of 1,133%, surpassing the benchmark S&P 500's total return of approximately 379%.\nNotably, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Meta, had a plan to split Facebook's stock in 2016. This involved creating a new class of shares without voting rights for the general public, which would have enabled Zuckerberg to maintain control of the company while selling his shares to finance his charitable initiatives.\nZuckerberg withdrew that proposal in September 2017, noting that \"Facebook's business has performed well and the value of our stock has grown to the point that I can fully fund our philanthropy and retain voting control of Facebook for 20 years or more.\"\nInvesting in a company solely because of the potential for a stock split is usually not recommended. The company's financial performance has a far more significant effect on its long-term stock performance. Therefore, it's more important to assess Meta's recent business performance and consider the guidance provided by its management when it comes to making an investing decision.\nIn 2023, which Zuckerberg deemed the \"year of efficiency,\" Meta generated $134.9 billion in revenue and $39 billion in net income, marking a year-over-year increase of 16% and 69%, respectively.\nLooking ahead, management provided revenue guidance in the range of $34.5 billion to $37 billion for the first quarter of 2024, representing a year-over-year increase between 21% and 29%. While management didn't offer an earnings outlook, it did note that its total expenses for 2024 are expected to be between $94 billion and $99 billion, reflecting a potential increase of between 6.6% and 12.2% from $88.2 billion in 2023.\nBeyond its recent financial results and management's guidance, Meta's strong balance sheet with net cash (cash and cash equivalents minus total debt) of $47 billion allows the company to return capital to shareholders. In 2023, Meta spent $20 billion on share repurchases, lowering its outstanding shares by 2%. The company still had $31 billion remaining on its share repurchasing program as of Dec. 31, 2023. Additionally, the tech company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, equating to an annual yield of 0.4%.\nOne concern for Meta is how much money it spends on its Reality Labs division, the company's virtual reality and augmented reality hardware and software unit. In 2023, Reality Labs was responsible for an astounding $16.1 billion loss from operations, which was 17.5% worse than in 2023. Moreover, Meta expects those losses to \"increase meaningfully\" in 2024.\nInvestors will have to wait and see whether Meta's big bet on Reality Labs pays off. In the meantime, Meta is producing strong revenue and earnings growth while returning capital to shareholders. Given its position as a leader in social networking, growth investors would be wise to consider it for their portfolios -- stock split or not.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Rachel Graf ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg is seeking to avoid being held personally liable in two dozen lawsuits accusing Meta Platforms Inc. and other social media companies of addicting children to their products.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nApple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey\nHow Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World\nOffice Tower Deal for $1 Reveals Anxiety Among Longtime Buyers\nA Spike in Heart Disease Deaths Since Covid Is Puzzling Scientists\nNvidia\u2019s $70 Million Florida Supercomputer Hobbled by DeSantis Law\nThe Meta chief executive officer made his case at a hearing Friday in California federal court, but the judge didn\u2019t immediately make a decision. A ruling in Zuckerberg\u2019s favor would dismiss him as a personal defendant in the litigation with no impact on the allegations against Meta.\nHolding him personally responsible may be a challenge because of a corporate law tradition of shielding executives from liability, especially at larger companies where decision-making is often layered. A loss for the billionaire who launched Facebook with friends as a Harvard undergraduate two decades ago could encourage claims against other CEOs in mass personal injury litigation.\nZuckerberg faces allegations from young people and parents that he was repeatedly warned that Instagram and Facebook weren\u2019t safe for children, but ignored the findings and chose not to share them publicly.\nThe cases naming Zuckerberg are a small subset of a collection of more than 1,000 suits in state and federal courts by families and public school districts against Meta along with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s TikTok and Snap Inc. US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, who is overseeing the federal cases, recently allowed some claims to proceed against the companies while dismissing others.\nPlaintiffs contend that as the face of Meta, Zuckerberg has a responsibility to \u201cspeak fully and truthfully on the risks Meta\u2019s platforms pose to children\u2019s health.\u201d\n\u201cWith great power comes great responsibility,\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers said in a court filing, quoting the Spider Man comics in a footnote. \u201cUnfortunately, Mr. Zuckerberg has not lived up to that maxim.\u201d\nZuckerberg, the world\u2019s fourth-richest person, has argued that he can\u2019t be held personally responsible for actions at Meta just because he\u2019s the CEO. His lawyers also claim that Zuckerberg didn\u2019t have a duty to disclose the safety findings that were allegedly reported to him.\n\u201cThere is ample legal precedent establishing that being an executive does not confer liability for alleged conduct of a corporation,\u201d a Meta spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the claims against Zuckerberg should be dismissed in their entirety.\nAt the hearing, Rogers pressed the plaintiffs about whether Zuckerberg was required to disclose safety information absent a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the users of his products. Plaintiffs had argued that the Meta CEO had a responsibility to Facebook and Instagram users given his \u201coutsize role in the company,\u201d but Rogers challenged them to point to a specific law that would support their argument.\nRogers appeared more sympathetic to plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that Zuckerberg could be held liable for personally concealing information as a corporate officer at Meta, asking Zuckerberg\u2019s lawyers how he avoids potential personal liability if there\u2019s an understanding that Meta itself had a duty to disclose the safety information.\nThe judge also discussed with lawyers how laws covering corporate officer responsibility, which vary among states, apply to Zuckerberg.\nWhen The Scrolling Doesn\u2019t Stop: Social Media Lawsuits Pile Up\nZuckerberg, who is Meta\u2019s most significant shareholder and maintains sole voting control at the company, is also at risk of being held personally liable in a separate 2022 lawsuit over the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal brought by the attorney general of the District of Columbia in Washington.\nPinning blame on an executive for unlawful conduct typically hinges on showing their involvement in relevant day-to-day decisions or their knowledge of the practices at issue. It\u2019s generally easier to assign executive liability at smaller companies, where an individual\u2019s direct participation in decision-making can be clearer. At large companies, liability comes down to proving control over decision-making.\nSocial media companies have come under increased scrutiny for their impact on young people\u2019s mental health and role in spreading sexually explicit content. At a Senate hearing last month, US Senator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, pressed Zuckerberg on whether he should personally compensate victims of sexual exploitation online. Zuckerberg then offered a rare apology to the victims\u2019 families.\nThe case is In Re Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury Products Liability Litigation, 22-md-03047, US District Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).\n--With assistance from Andrea Vittorio and Kurt Wagner.\n(Updates with Meta comment.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nElon Musk\u2019s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations\nHong Kong\u2019s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen\nThere\u2019s One Musk Endeavor That\u2019s Not Doing So Great\nTranscript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?\nThe High Cost of Eating Out in America\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

That will help them avoid an Apple commission that Meta said would take effect this month.\nApple\u2019s new policy requires advertisers to use its In-App Purchase feature whenever they pay to \u201cboost\u201d social media posts \u2014 a move that gives the content more exposure. Apple takes a cut of as much as 30% on app purchases in its iOS software, meaning that Meta will lose a portion of its ad revenue to the iPhone maker.\nThe policy change, first announced by Apple in 2022, ratcheted up tension between the tech giants, which have become two of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest adversaries in recent years. At the time, Meta accused the company of \u201cundercutting others in the digital economy.\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has also frequently criticized Apple for wielding too much control over its App Store.\nApple said Thursday that treating boosts as an In-App Purchase is consistent with its longstanding approach to the App Store. The company said it spent more than a year discussing the boosting policy with Meta, giving them ample time to comply.\n\u201cWe have always required that purchases of digital goods and services within apps must use In-App Purchase,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cBoosting, which allows an individual or organization to pay to increase the reach of a post or profile, is a digital service \u2014 so of course In-App Purchase is required. This has always been the case and there are many examples of apps that do it successfully.\u201d\nApple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has been a vocal detractor of the privacy practices at Meta, which relies on user data to sell ads. Previous Apple changes have hit Meta in the pocketbook.

        "Title": "Is Nvidia or Meta Platforms the Better Dividend Stock?",
        "Author": "  George Budwell, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) are two of the most successful technology companies in the world. However, these tech titans have historically had very different approaches to rewarding their shareholders. For instance, Nvidia has been paying a quarterly dividend since its fiscal 2012 year, while Meta Platforms will pay its first dividend in March 2024.\nWhich one is the better dividend stock? Let's compare them based on some key metrics to find out.\nRevenue growth: Both companies have been increasing their revenue at breakneck rates, but Nvidia has been faster in recent history. In the past five years, Nvidia's revenue has skyrocketed 147%, while Meta's revenue has jumped 90.8%. Nvidia's revenue growth has been driven by strong demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) in the gaming, data center, artificial intelligence, and automotive markets. Meta's revenue growth has been fueled by its dominant position in social media, online advertising, and virtual reality.\nMETA Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts\nEPS growth: Nvidia has also been more profitable than Meta over the past five years, as measured by diluted normalized earnings per share (EPS). Over this period, Nvidia's EPS has soared by 473%, while Meta's EPS has risen by 123%. Nvidia's EPS growth has benefited from its high-margin GPU business and efficient capital allocation. Meta's EPS expansion has been hampered by its high operating expenses stemming from its build-out of the metaverse. Still, the social media company's five-year EPS growth is impressive, even though it doesn't compare favorably to Nvidia's scorching bottom-line growth over this time frame.\nEPS growth outlook: Looking ahead, both companies are expected to increase their EPS at robust rates, but Nvidia is the clear winner on this metric. According to analysts' estimates, Nvidia's EPS ought to rise by a whopping 71.6% in fiscal 2025. Meta, on the other hand, is expected to post EPS growth of 15.1% in calender year 2025. Nvidia's bottom line is booming due to the explosion in demand for chips capable of handling generative artificial intelligence (AI) workloads.\nRevenue growth outlook: Similarly, both companies are projected to increase their revenue at healthy rates, but Nvidia wins again on this metric as well. Analysts forecast Nvidia's revenue will climb 59.5% in fiscal 2025. That easily trumps Meta's projected revenue boost of 12.4% in calendar year 2025. In absolute terms, though, Meta's double-digit revenue growth forecast is impressive in its own right.\nValuation: Thanks to their stellar growth profiles, both companies have earned a premium valuation. Nvidia's stock is presently trading at 35.5 times projected earnings, while while Meta's shares trade for 23.3 times forward earnings. For reference, the S&P 500 index sports a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio of 22.9 at the time of this writing. As such, Nvidia and Meta are both expensive relative to the broader market, but Meta stock has the more compelling valuation.\nDividend yield: One of the main attractions of dividend stocks is their yield, which measures how much income they generate for investors relative to their share price. Currently, Nvidia has a tiny dividend yield of just 0.02%. Meta's annualized yield stands at 0.43%. Meta thus offers the richer dividend of the two.\nDebt-to-equity ratio: This is a measure of financial leverage that compares how much debt a business uses to finance its assets relative to its equity. This metric is also a proxy for the health of a company's balance sheet. A lower ratio indicates less reliance on debt and more financial stability. Nvidia has a debt-to-equity ratio of 33.1%, indicating a robust balance sheet. Meta, for its part, sports a debt-to-equity ratio of 24.7%. Overall, both companies have strong balance sheets, which is a great sign in terms of the reliability of their cash distributions to shareholders.\nBased on these metrics, Nvidia is a better dividend stock than Meta Platforms. While Meta has a higher dividend yield, Nvidia has a much faster EPS growth rate and it is a critical player in AI architecture. Nvidia's dividend may be small, but it is likely to rise steadily over time, along with its earnings. Meta's dividend may be larger, but the company is more vulnerable to regulatory and competitive headwinds. Hence, dividend investors may want to opt for Nvidia over Meta Platforms.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Meta (META) announced it is working on a means of better detecting and identifying AI-generated images across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads in the lead-up to the 2024 elections. The technology, which Meta\u2019s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, says is currently in development, would inform users when an image they see in their feed has been generated using artificial intelligence.\nCurrently, Meta adds a watermark and metadata to images generated using its Meta AI software. Now, however, the company is looking to expand that capability to images generated by contemporaries like Adobe (ADBE), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Midjourney, Microsoft (MSFT), OpenAI, and Shutterstock (SSTK).\nClegg says Meta is working with the Partnership on AI, a nonprofit made up of academics, civil society professionals, and media organizations dedicated to ensuring AI has \u201cpositive outcomes for people and society,\u201d to come up with standards that can be used to identify AI images across the web.\nExperts say generative AI images could create a tsunami of disinformation in the lead-up to the election. We\u2019re already seeing some of what\u2019s to come in real time. When former President Trump was arrested in New York in 2023, images of what appeared to be of him running from police began spreading across the web.\nAnd a likely AI-generated image of an explosion outside of the Pentagon that hit the internet last year briefly sent stocks sliding in New York in 2023 before officials said there was nothing out of the ordinary.\nWhile Meta\u2019s moves will help identify AI-generated images, they won\u2019t be able to recognize AI-generated videos or audio. To that end, Clegg said, the company is adding a feature that people can use to label AI-generated video and audio they share across Meta. If users don\u2019t, he explained, they may face penalties.\n\u201cWhile companies are starting to include signals in their image generators, they haven\u2019t started including them in AI tools that generate audio and video at the same scale, so we can\u2019t yet detect those signals and label this content from other companies,\u201d he said.\nAI-generated audio and videos have already been used to spread disinformation. In 2022, a deepfake video of a phony Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky telling troops to put down their weapons hit the web. And in January, a deepfake audio recording of a fake President Biden telling voters not to take part in the presidential primary went out in New Hampshire.\nClegg also pointed out that though Meta will be able to identify AI-generated images, there are still ways that those markers can be manipulated or removed. To prevent that, he said, the company\u2019s Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team is working on a way of implanting a watermark into an image while it\u2019s being generated so that it can\u2019t be removed.\nGenerative AI content is still a new concept to many people on the web. And while the concept of Photoshopping an image isn\u2019t novel, the ability to generate a huge number of images in no time and flood social media with them is.\nThe deluge of AI-generated explicit images of Taylor Swift that circulated across sites, including X, formerly known as Twitter, illustrates how easy it is for such content to propagate across huge swaths of the internet in no time. Meta\u2019s solution is just one tool in what will have to be an expansive chest of options to combat the new generation of misinformation.\nOn Monday, Meta's Oversight Board criticized the company over how it currently handles manipulated video content. The board said it is \"concerned about the Manipulated Media policy in its current form, finding it to be incoherent, lacking in persuasive justification and inappropriately focused on how content is created, rather than on which specific harms it aims to prevent, such as disrupting electoral processes.\"\nThe board suggested Meta should, \"begin labeling manipulated content, such as videos altered by artificial intelligence (AI) or other means when such content may cause harm.\"\nThe board's remarks came in response to a video of President Biden that was altered without using AI and allowed to stay up because it didn't run afoul of the company's Manipulated Media policy. The group says Meta needs to add context to videos that are manipulated with means other than AI.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "Title": "Could Snap Become the Next Meta Platforms?",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Snap's (NYSE: SNAP) stock hit an all-time high of $83.11 on Sept. 24, 2021. That gave the social media company a market cap of $131 billion and represented a 389% gain from its initial public offering (IPO) price of $17 in 2017. At the time, Snap's Snapchat seemed to be mounting a strong comeback against Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) Facebook and Instagram. It also silenced the bears who argued that Snap should have just accepted Facebook's $3 billion buyout offer in 2013.\nBut today, Snap's stock trades at about $11 with a market cap of $18 billion. It tumbled below its IPO price as the growth in daily active users (DAUs) slowed down, its average revenue per user (ARPU) declined, and the company remained deeply unprofitable.\nThat slowdown was caused by Apple's privacy-oriented changes to iOS, stiff competition from Instagram and ByteDance's TikTok, and tough macro headwinds. Rising interest rates also compressed Snap's valuation ratios, as investors backed away from higher-risk investments. That situation seems bleak, but could Snap bounce back over the next decade to be comparable to Meta Platforms again?\nSnap and Meta both struggled with TikTok's growth in short videos, as well as Apple's changes to iOS, which made it harder for apps to gather third-party data for personalized ads. Snap tried to counter those threats by expanding its first-party Direct Response ads and its Spotlight short video platform. Meanwhile, Meta rolled out new AI algorithms to gather more first-party data for its ads while expanding its Reels short video platform.\nSnap and Meta both continued to gain new users as they dealt with those challenges. Snap's DAUs rose 10% to 414 million in 2023. Meta's total number of daily active people across its entire family of apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp) increased 8% year over year to 3.19 billion in December 2023. Within that total, Facebook's DAUs rose 6% year over year to 2.11 billion.\nHowever, Snap still grew at a slower rate than Meta in 2023. Snap's revenue stayed nearly flat at $4.6 billion while Meta's revenue rose 16% to $134.9 billion. Snap's first-party ads didn't fully counter Apple's privacy changes, and its Spotlight video platform didn't gain much momentum against TikTok and Reels. Snapchat's growing dependence on lower-revenue overseas markets for new DAUs also consistently reduced its ARPU and total revenue.\nMeta's AI algorithms for ad management curbed its dependence on third-party data and supported its expansion of Reels videos on Facebook and Instagram. It offset declining ad prices with a much higher number of ad impressions, and it attracted an influx of ad spending from Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies that were trying to reach more overseas customers. Those Chinese ad buyers -- which didn't plow nearly as much cash into Snapchat's advertising platform -- accounted for 10% of Meta's revenue in 2023 and contributed 5 percentage points to its annual revenue growth.\nIn 2024, analysts expect Snap's revenue to rise 14% as its turnaround efforts gradually kick in. However, they expect Meta's revenue to rise 20%. It's generally a red flag when an underdog is growing slower than the mature market leader.\nBack in 2021, Snap claimed it could achieve \"50 percent-plus revenue growth\" for \"multiple years\" by turning Snapchat into a super app with more augmented reality (AR) features, games, videos, and digital payment features. It sounded like Snap wanted to make Snapchat something like Tencent's WeChat super app in China -- which wasn't too surprising since Tencent became one of Snap's top investors in late 2017.\nBut after broadly missing those lofty revenue growth targets in 2022 and 2023, Snap hastily shut down its streaming video, gaming, and enterprise AR divisions to focus on strengthening Snapchat's core app, its AR tools, and its Spotlight short video platform. It also laid off a fifth of its workforce last year and cut 10% of the remaining jobs earlier this year.\nUnfortunately, Snap remained deeply unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis even after executing those cost-cutting efforts -- and analysts expect its bottom line to stay in the red for the foreseeable future.\nMeanwhile, Meta continued to burn billions of dollars each year to expand its unprofitable Reality Labs business (which houses its virtual and augmented reality devices), but it easily offset those losses with higher-margin ad revenues and remained firmly profitable. Therefore, Meta could gradually expand its core social network into the VR and AR markets over the next few years -- the Metaverse dream isn't dead -- while Snap shrinks its ecosystem and shrivels back into its niche market.\nSnap is still smaller and less diversified, and targets a narrower niche of younger social media users than Meta. It's also growing at a slower rate, bleeding red ink, and struggling to keep pace with TikTok and Reels in the seismic shift toward short video posts. Snap might keep growing over the next decade as it gradually narrows its net losses, but it probably won't evolve into a trillion-dollar social media juggernaut like Meta Platforms.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Snap right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Snap, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Snap wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nAs of 2024-02-26, Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $469.25. It's currently trading at a price of $484.03. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -3.15%. The company is fair valued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$15.02\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.24%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 35.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n532.69\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n796.35\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n469.25\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $521.47. This valuation indicates that the Meta Platforms Inc is fair valued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 7.18%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) May Be Center Stage for Meta. But Here Are 2 Other Reasons the Stock Should Be on Your Radar.",
        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "As earnings season kicks into gear, all eyes are on big tech. Why? Well, the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks all played an important role in the Nasdaq Composite's 43% surge last year, and momentum has gotten stronger in 2024, which has helped the S&P 500 soar to new highs.\nFollowing its fourth-quarter earnings report on Feb. 1, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) rocketed by more than 20% and re-entered the exclusive club of trillion-dollar companies.\nWhile progress in artificial intelligence (AI) applications is front and center for investors, Meta's management was sure to tame expectations amid the enthusiasm. Nevertheless, investors are cheering on the stock.\nLet's dig into two important developments outside of AI that may be influencing the recent price action.\nIn 2022, Meta had its eyes on a new growth driver called the metaverse. The company invested heavily in applications such as augmented and virtual reality, and bolstered its headcount significantly. Unfortunately, investors quickly soared on this strategy due to the toll these investments were taking on Meta's overall revenue and profits. The company's core advertising business stalled while expenses mounted, resulting in deteriorating cash flow. Unsurprisingly, Meta stock cratered by more than 60% in 2022.\nToward the end of 2022, a prominent venture capitalist (VC) named Brad Gerstner penned an open letter to Meta's executive leadership and board of directors. Gerstner urged the company \"get fit\" and return to its roots. Last year, Meta employed a series of layoffs to right-size its cost structure and turned its focus back to the advertising business.\nFor the full year 2023, Meta grew its revenue by 16% year over year and expanded its operating margins by 10 percentage points. The combination of accelerated revenue growth and margin expansion helped fuel growth in free cash flow by nearly 140% year over year.\nWith $65.4 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, Meta appears to be deploying this capital to reward shareholders in two ways.\nFirst, the company repurchased $20 billion of stock in 2023. Moreover, as of Dec. 31, Meta had roughly $31 billion available and authorized by the board for share repurchases. In addition, the company announced an increase of $50 billion to its share repurchase authorization during the earnings call.\nGiven where Meta stock began trading in 2023, coupled with the company's attractive valuation, it's not entirely surprising to see a buyback. However, the announcement of the $50 billion increase was encouraging to see as Meta appears to be well-positioned for the next phase of long-term growth fueled by artificial intelligence (AI).\nAlthough the share repurchase news was nice to see, it appears that Meta has found additional ways to deploy its excess profits. Perhaps more surprising was the announcement of the company's first dividend. Per the earnings release, Meta will pay a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share.\nThe company's CFO, Susan Li, commented on the development, saying that \"introducing a dividend really just serves as a nice complement to the existing share repurchase program.\"\nI see this as an important step for Meta as it matures. Generally speaking, growth companies typically do not pay dividends, as any excess cash that is generated tends to be reinvested in additional research and development (R&D) or marketing efforts. Meta is only the fourth Magnificent Seven\u00a0stock to pay a dividend -- joining Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia.\nWhen it comes to tech stocks, a lot of investors seem to be enamored of the prospects of artificial intelligence (AI), and rightfully so. The proliferation of generative AI can't be understated. However, prudent investors should realize that use cases for the technology are still very much in discovery territory, and the long-term gains for AI could be years away.\nIn the meantime, Meta has found other creative sources to rally investor enthusiasm. With accelerating revenue, margins, and cash flow, Meta is showing some true signs of a healthy, maturing business. Moreover, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of roughly 23 is nearly identical to that of the S&P 500. This could signal that investors do not think Meta's growth prospects are more attractive than the broader market's.\nI see Meta as an attractive opportunity at its current valuation, and think using dollar-cost averaging to scoop up some shares could be a wise decision in the long-run. The combination of share repurchases and a dividend certainly make the company stand out among its cohort, and the stock looks tempting for AI investors in particular.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sarah Perez ",
        "Text": "Threads may be about to get another big boost from parent company Meta...at least in terms of sources of new content. The company has been spotted testing a cross-posting feature that would allow Facebook users to post to both platforms at the same time, using the same feature that was originally available for cross-posting from Facebook to Instagram.\nThe company confirmed a limited test has begun, but is restricted to iOS and does not include the EU. The feature will allow users to share both text and link posts from Facebook to Threads, a rep for Meta said.\nThe addition could help content creators who regularly post photos or other media along with text updates from the hassles of having to post in multiple places. It also ties Threads more closely to Meta's larger app ecosystem, which could potentially give Threads' app a boost, if the test rolls out more broadly. Today, Meta's family of apps reaches 3.98 billion users. Even if only a sliver of those on Facebook used the cross-posting feature for Threads, it could still dramatically increase the number of posts available on the app.\nFacebook added the option to cross-post to Instagram in 2021, after earlier offering the ability to cross-post Stories between the two platforms. With last summer's launch of its Twitter/X competitor, Threads, the company leveraged its other, larger social networks to rapidly grow the new service's user base.\nInitially, new Threads users were automatically connected with others they knew or followed on Instagram, allowing the network to scale quickly after launching, topping a record-setting 100 million users within five days of its arrival, and soon achieving one-fifth of the weekly active user base of Twitter/X. As of Meta's most recent quarter, Threads reached more than 130 million monthly active users, thanks in part to how the company showcased popular Threads within the main feeds of both Facebook and Instagram.\nImage Credits: Screenshot from @whimchic (opens in a new window)\nThe test of the Facebook cross-posting feature was recently spotted in the wild on Facebook's iOS app, as in this example here shared by Threads user @whimchic (Ljiljana Grujicic). When she tested the feature, the post was automatically published to both accounts associated with her same profile, but didn't include any account information from Facebook or a flag that it was cross-posted. The latter could be a concern for someone who uses their full name on Facebook but a more anonymous handle on a more public platform like Threads.\nThis isn't the first time Threads has toyed with cross-posting. Earlier, users on Threads were upset to find that their posts were being automatically shared on Facebook and Instagram -- where their audiences were different from those who followed them on Threads. Often, users connect with family and friends on Facebook and Instagram but maintain a public persona or talk about their work or political interests on Threads, similar to how they used Twitter. In response to user feedback, Meta soon added an option that allowed users to turn off automatic sharing by default and the backlash died down.\nCross-posting wasn't the only area where Facebook is testing new features. Grujicic also shared a photo on LinkedIn that showed a test of a \"Write with AI\" writing assistant that could help users craft their posts.\nImage Credits: Ljiljana Grujicic via LinkedIn (opens in a new window)\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/meta-tests-cross-posting-from-facebook-to-its-twitter-x-competitor-threads/\n"

        "Title": "META, AMZN, MSFT: Which Stock Is Best after Their Magnificent Earnings?",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "The so-called Magnificent Seven have pulled the curtain on their earnings results. Though most Magnificent Seven members clocked in some magnificent quarters, there was one EV maker that delivered results that can only be described as less-than-magnificent. In any case, this piece will focus on a trio of Magnificent Seven members (META, AMZN, and MSFT) that stepped up to the plate and swung one out of the ballpark, sparking an impressive rally alongside a wave of analyst price target upgrades.\nTherefore, let\u2019s use TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool to check in with the three aforementioned stocks that delivered and could continue to do so in the year ahead, thanks in part to a bit of help from their growing stake in artificial intelligence (AI).\nMeta Platforms delivered the most impressive quarterly results this earnings season, sparking one of the biggest single-day rallies in the company\u2019s history. Undoubtedly, Meta stock\u2019s more than 20% surge represented the largest-ever single-day market cap gain of $204.5 billion. Put that one in the record books.\nWith a fresh dividend, AI tailwinds at its back, and the wildcard of its Reality Labs business, many analysts on Wall Street see the red-hot stock climbing even higher as it enters its dividend-paying era. All things considered, I find it hard to be any less bullish following the latest spike.\nIn fact, Morgan Stanley seems to think Meta is a stock to keep buying after its blowout earnings results. The company\u2019s new AI tools are just one of the drivers that has the bank staying bullish. In a prior piece, I highlighted the potential of ad automation tool Advantage+ and its ability to give the ad business a real shot in the arm.\nJust because Meta is maturing, with a dividend to pay (0.44% yield at writing), does not mean it\u2019s steering off the growth track. If anything, Meta may be the most exciting Magnificent Seven member, given how effectively Mark Zuckerberg and his team have turned a corner following its \u201cYear of Efficiency.\u201d\nAs the company moves into a year (or should I say decade) of AI, the stock certainly seems too cheap at 23.7 times forward price-to-earnings, far below most Magnificent Seven members. The lowest-hanging fruit may have been picked amid last year\u2019s efficiency push, but don\u2019t expect management to settle into cruise mode as it looks to pull ahead in the so-called AI race while keeping up with peers in the virtual- and augmented-reality scene.\nMeta stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 38 Buys, two Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average META stock price target\u00a0of $522.00 implies 11.2% upside potential.\nAmazon stock has also been riding higher following its own slate of quarterly earnings results. The numbers were exceptional, helping power shares more than 7% higher in a single trading session. With new all-time highs in sight (around 8% away), plenty of AI rally fuel, and a strong holiday season in the books, analysts seem right on the money to stay bullish on the stock post-earnings.\nLike Meta, Amazon wants to equip advertisers with the right tools. With the firm launching new privacy tools in the European market while starting ads (and a paid option to eliminate them) on its streaming service Prime Video, it seems positioned to make a growing dent in the ad market.\nIndeed, Amazon\u2019s many Prime users will not be happy to have to view ads as they enjoy their paid Prime content. And though some may question the value proposition of being a Prime member (have the perks added up, or only the price hikes?), the consumer will speak with their money. For now, Prime looks sticky enough to not shed too many users due to the inclusion of ads on Prime Video.\nCombine AI tools with ads, and it\u2019s no mystery as to why RBC Capital views Amazon as one of its top tech picks (one of the others is Meta) to play the digital ad market in the new year. I think they\u2019re right to praise the company as it looks to go above and beyond just being an e-commerce and cloud retailer.\nAmazon stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with unanimous 40 Buys assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average AMZN stock price target\u00a0of $207.72 implies 21.8% upside potential.\nMicrosoft also stood tall following its earnings report, with investors impressed by the company\u2019s AI muscles. In many ways, Microsoft is still the AI stock to own for those who prefer to bet on software over hardware. While Microsoft is poised to gain some skin in the AI chip game, the company still remains a software titan that\u2019s likely to continue having its way with rivals.\nWith a Super Bowl ad for its AI software CoPilot ready to go, it will be interesting to see where adoption of the Microsoft ecosystem goes from here as more are drawn in by its impressive AI capabilities. It\u2019s hard not to be bullish, even with shares at fresh highs and a trailing price-to-earnings multiple now well above 35 times.\nApart from AI, Microsoft seems to be opening up its Xbox gaming ecosystem by sharing plans to bring its Xbox-exclusive games over to its rival console, PlayStation. Indeed, such a move could curb demand for its console while also dealing a heavy blow to the so-called \u201cconsole wars.\u201d\nThat said, by expanding the total addressable market for its games, I view the move as a net positive, even if it rubs some Xbox gamers the wrong way. If the friendly gesture is reciprocated by Sony (the firm behind PlayStation), the move could be a net positive for both console combatants as more emphasis is placed on growth in software.\nMicrosoft stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 32 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average MSFT stock price target\u00a0of $469.45 implies 13.4% upside potential.\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks could continue higher if they continue smashing quarterly earnings this year. Undoubtedly, AI could be the magic that helps them keep pulling rabbits out of hats come future earnings seasons. Of the trio, analysts see the most upside (21.8%) in AMZN stock.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) -Meta Platforms said on Thursday that businesses purchasing a \"boost\" for their posts on the iOS versions of its social media apps Facebook and Instagram would need to pay an extra 30% service charge to app store operator Apple.\nAdvertisers will be able to boost their content on Instagram and Facebook via a browser without paying the Apple service charges, the social media giant said.\nApple had announced the updated App Store guidelines in 2022. Meta said it will start implementing the changes this month in the United States and that other markets will be subject to this fee later in the year.\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment on whether there would be any material impact from the change.\n\"We are required to either comply with Apple's guidelines, or remove boosted posts from our apps,\" Meta said in a statement.\n\"We do not want to remove the ability to boost posts, as this would hurt small businesses by making the feature less discoverable and potentially deprive them of a valuable way to promote their business.\"\nAs part of the change, advertisers boosting posts on iOS will be billed by Apple, not Meta, and will be required to pay in advance rather than after the ads run.\nBoosted posts is a product offered by Meta to businesses looking to promote their content on apps like Facebook or Instagram, without requiring a campaign through Ads Manager, Meta's advertising tool that lets brands buy and create ads.\n\"Boosting, which allows an individual or organization to pay to increase the reach of a post or profile, is a digital service - so of course In-App Purchase is required,\" Apple said in a statement. \"This has always been the case and there are many examples of apps that do it successfully.\"\nHowever, Apple said that Meta customers can still use a separate standalone app called \"Meta Ads Manager\" to pay for their ad campaigns without paying commissions to Apple because that separate app falls under an exemption for advertising campaign management apps.\n(Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru, Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Maju Samuel and David Evans)\n"

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Meta\u2019s (META) Mark Zuckerberg got his hands on Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Vision Pro and, perhaps unsurprisingly, he\u2019s not all that impressed. In an Instagram Reel posted Tuesday evening, the social media CEO sized up Apple\u2019s headset against Meta\u2019s own Quest 3 and came to the conclusion that \u201cthe Quest is the better product, period.\u201d\nZuckerberg\u2019s post, which he largely filmed using the Quest 3, comes as Apple\u2019s Vision Pro approaches its second week on the market. The $3,499 \u201cspatial computer\u201d quickly went viral as videos and photos of people using it bounced across social media.\nAll of the hype leading into the Vision Pro\u2019s launch seemingly irked Zuckerberg, who has funneled billions into Meta\u2019s efforts to take VR/AR headsets mainstream and jumpstart his vision for the metaverse, a series of interconnected online worlds.\nIn his review of the Vision Pro, Zuckerberg calls out a handful of differences between the devices, chief among them their prices. Apple\u2019s Vision Pro is priced well beyond the average consumer electronics product. At $499, the Quest 3 isn\u2019t exactly cheap, though it does come closer to what you\u2019d spend on a modern game console or laptop than Apple\u2019s offering.\nZuckerberg also needled the Vision Pro for requiring a wired external battery pack and said the Quest is more comfortable and has a wider field of view and brighter display.\n\u201cI was surprised by how many tradeoffs [Apple] had to make to the quality of the device,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty surprised that Quest is so much better for the vast majority of things that people use these headsets for.\u201d\nZuckerberg also spoke to the broader ecosystems powering the headsets, touching on Apple\u2019s closed-off operating system compared to Meta\u2019s more open approach, saying he wants to see an open approach win out.\nFor what it's worth, I've used both the Quest 3 and Vision Pro and found the Vision Pro to be easier to navigate and quite comfortable. Its display was also a standout, offering impressive clarity compared to the Quest 3.\nIt makes sense for Zuckerberg to promote his product. But critiquing Apple\u2019s Vision Pro is an unusual step among tech CEOs.\n\u201cI think one of the reasons for anyone to do what he did is to keep up that hype, keep up that momentum, because this market surely needs that,\u201d explained Gartner director and analyst Tuong Nguyen. \u201cKeep people interested, and what better way to keep them interested than shots fired.\u201d\nAccording to Nguyen, Zuckerberg\u2019s battle with Apple is a good thing because it means increased competition, which should ultimately benefit consumers.\nIt\u2019s also important to keep in mind that Apple could address Zuckerberg\u2019s criticisms with the next version of the Vision Pro, explained IDC research director Ramon Llamas.\n\u201cLet's come back in a year, let's come back in two years, and let's see how that story changes,\u201d he said.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Zuckerberg and Apple have butted heads. Heck, it\u2019s not the first time the CEO has used his social platform to tangle with another Big Tech executive. You\u2019ll recall the billionaire was previously set to fight Tesla CEO Elon Musk after the X owner challenged Zuckerberg to an MMA match in 2023.\nBut his disdain for Apple runs deeper than playground antics.\nApple kneecapped Meta\u2019s ad business with the release of its App Tracking Transparency feature in 2021. The software update gave iPhone users the ability to keep apps from tracking their movement across the web and other apps, cutting into a key piece of Meta\u2019s data stream, which helps power its advertising sales.\nMeta has also criticized Apple for its so-called walled garden-style operating system that gives the iPhone maker ultimate control over what kind of apps and software users can install on their devices.\nHowever Zuckerberg feels about Apple\u2019s Vision Pro, though, the headset war will ultimately come down to device sales. And if the Vision Pro can beat the Quest 3 there, the CEO\u2019s opinions won\u2019t matter all that much.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Author": "  James Titcomb ",
        "Text": "Meta has warned investors that Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s martial arts hobby carries the risk of serious injury or death.\nThe social media giant said that its founder\u2019s fondness for competitive fighting, which saw him undergo surgery for a torn ligament last year, could affect the company if he was sidelined.\nIn an unusual disclosure to investors, Meta said: \u201cMr Zuckerberg and certain other members of management participate in various high-risk activities, such as combat sports, extreme sports, and recreational aviation, which carry the risk of serious injury and death.\n\u201cIf Mr Zuckerberg were to become unavailable for any reason, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations.\u201d\nThe Meta chief has become increasingly obsessed with mixed martial arts, building an \u201coctagon\u201d in his garden and training with former professionals.\nLast year, he discussed setting up a \u201ccage match\u201d with Elon Musk, although talks over the fight went nowhere.\nMr Zuckerberg said later that the Tesla tycoon was not serious about the offer.\nHe has also enthusiastically taken up hydrofoiling, a type of surfing, and reportedly obtained a pilot\u2019s licence last year.\nUS-listed companies are required to disclose various \u201crisk factors\u201d to investors to protect themselves from lawsuits.\nThe disclosure came as Mr Zuckerberg surpassed Bill Gates as the world\u2019s fourth-richest man.\nHis net worth swelled to more than $166bn (\u00a3132bn) on Friday as Meta shares jumped by 21pc following stellar financial results.\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said on Thursday that profits had trebled.\nThis led to the business unveiling plans to return $50bn to shareholders through share buybacks and pay its first dividend.\nIn the global rich list, Mr Zuckerberg now sits behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, French luxury magnate Bernard Arnault, and Elon Musk \u2013 the world\u2019s richest person with a $205bn net worth.\nMr Bezos regained his status as the world\u2019s second richest person on Friday, overtaking Mr Arnault, after a leap in Amazon shares.\nMeanwhile, Mr Musk is at risk of falling behind Mr Bezos after he lost a key legal battle over a $56bn Tesla pay package this week.\nMr Zuckerberg will be a direct beneficiary of Meta\u2019s plans for a quarterly 50 cents-a-share dividend, as he will receive $700m a year from the company.\nMeta\u2019s founder receives a $1 salary and no other compensation, with his net worth directly tied to Meta\u2019s share price.\nThe company does, however, pay for his personal security at a cost of $14m.\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

        "Author": "  Matthew Field ",
        "Text": "Sir Nick Clegg has admitted Facebook is struggling to combat the spread of fake videos, after Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak were targeted by AI impersonators.\nMeta\u2019s head of global affairs said the company would introduce new rules to try and halt the spread of synthetic videos that seek to manipulate users, but added it lacked the technology to stop them outright.\nSir Nick said while Meta had now developed new tools to automatically detect images altered with AI, it could not yet replicate this for video or sound recordings.\nThe former deputy prime minister said Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, would tag synthetic, photorealistic pictures with a label explaining the image was \u201cimagined with AI\u201d. He said other AI companies had started adding \u201cinvisible watermarks\u201d to their images, which Meta was able to detect.\nHowever, these identifying markers have yet to be added to video or audio, \u201cso we can\u2019t yet detect those signals and label this content from other companies\u201d, Sir Nick said.\nHe added the company\u2019s efforts were \u201cwhat\u2019s technically possible right now. But it\u2019s not yet possible to identify all AI-generated content\u201d.\nMeta said it was working with AI companies to better detect manipulated videos, but in the meantime it would require users to proactively label videos that have been altered with AI, making it clear they are synthetic. Those that fail to do so could be penalised.\nSir Nick said the company was being \u201copen about the limits of what\u2019s possible\u201d.\nThe admission comes as the tech giant faces growing pressure to tackle false videos and images ahead of multiple elections and faces accusations it is not doing enough to protect children online.\nOn Monday, the company\u2019s Oversight Board, which reviews its moderation decisions, criticised Meta\u2019s policy on \u201cmanipulated media\u201d, calling it \u201cincoherent and confusing\u201d.\nThe Board raised questions over why Meta\u2019s policy on digitally altered content only applies to videos, when fake audio clips have already been used to spread disinformation about elections.\nThere are fears AI-generated videos, which can look extremely realistic, could be used to spread misinformation during elections. The panel said Meta needed to \u201cmake revisions quickly, given the record number of elections in 2024\u201d.\nA digitally altered video of President Biden, falsely implying he had groped a young woman, spread widely on Facebook last year.\nMore recently, videos with doctored audio from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and London Mayor Sadiq Khan have been posted to social media. Last month, it was reported that hundreds of adverts featuring deepfake footage of Mr Sunak had also been posted to Facebook, promoting an investment scam.\nIn January, Michelle Donelan, the Technology Secretary, said the Government planned to introduce \u201crobust mechanisms\u201d to tackle election-related deepfakes, but added \u201cnobody has a silver bullet\u201d.\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

        "Text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed cooperation on extended reality devices with LG Electronics executives on Wednesday as part of his visit to South Korea that highlights Meta's ambitions in artificial intelligence.\nSouth Korea is the second leg of Zuckerberg\u2019s three-nation Asian tour that observers say is meant to discuss partnerships with tech powerhouses and forge good relations with business and government leaders in the region. He already visited Japan and will travel to India later this week.\nOn Wednesday, Zuckerberg met LG Electronics CEO William Cho for two hours to talk about business strategies for extended reality \u2014 known as XR \u2014 device development, LG said in a statement.\nWhile experiencing Meta\u2019s latest virtual-reality headset, the Quest 3, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, Cho \u201cexpressed a keen interest in Meta\u2019s advanced technology demonstrations, notably focusing on Meta\u2019s large language models and its potential for on-device AI integration,\u201d the LG statement said.\nLG is ramping up its strategic collaboration with Meta, aiming to expedite its XR ventures, it said. XR includes augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality and other related technologies.\nLater Wednesday, Zuckerberg met Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Jae-yong, according to local media. He is scheduled to meet South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday.\n\u201cMeta already collaborated with high-end sunglasses brand Ray-Ban to launch smart glasses last year. Just like this, Meta could possibly want to introduce their XR technology to a worldwide customer base of a global consumer electronics maker like LG,\u201d said Kim Yang Paeng, a technology analyst at the Korea Institute of Economics and Technology.\nKim said Zuckerberg will also likely talk with Samsung about producing Meta-exclusive chips to ease its reliance on the AI chip market-dominant NVIDIA.\nZuckerberg's visit to Asia comes as Meta ramps up its efforts in artificial intelligence amid a race involving technology firms OpenAI, Google and Microsoft. In a Instagram reel in January, Zuckerberg said that it was Meta's \u201clong term vision to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit.\"\nMeta is building massive compute infrastructure \u2014 equivalent to 600k NVIDIA H100 GPUs' worth \u2014 to support its artificial intelligence plans as it begins training its Llama 3 generative AI model, he said in the reel. Generative AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot and Meta's Llama 3 are artificial intelligence systems that can generate content based on user prompts.\nLee Tae-kyu, an expert at the Korea Economic Research Institute, said Meta would think cooperation with Samsung and LG is important as they are top-level tech companies outside the United States. Samsung and LG, on the other hand, would also highly value partnerships with Meta, whose products target customers around the world.\nDuring his visit to Tokyo, Zuckerberg met Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and later told reporters: \u201cWe had a good productive conversation about AI and the future of technology, and I am really excited for the work that is happening here in Japan.\u201d\nHe was in Japan with his family for a trip that mixed business with pleasure. He went skiing with his family, visited a McDonald\u2019s outlet and learned how swords are made at a swordsmiths near Tokyo.\nDuring his visit to India, he will attend a wedding ceremony for the son of billionaire Mukesh Ambani, head of the oil and technology conglomerate Reliance Industries.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n"

        "Author": "  JON GAMBRELL ",
        "Text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Meta has removed Instagram and Facebook accounts run on behalf of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei after criticism over his support for Hamas after its Oct. 7 attack on Israel that sparked the monthslong war still raging in the Gaza Strip, the company confirmed Friday.\nMeta, based in Menlo Park, California, offered no specifics about its reasoning. However, it said it removed the accounts \u201cfor repeatedly violating our Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not allow organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence to have a presence on our platforms,\u201d the policy states. That includes those designated as terrorists by the U.S. government.\nIran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nKhamenei and his vast patronage network inside Iran have long been targeted by American sanctions. Khamenei himself has been targeted by U.S. sanctions since 2019 by the administration of then-President Donald Trump as tensions began to spiral in the Middle East over Trump unilaterally withdrawing America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers.\nHowever, pressure has been growing on online platforms to remove Khamenei in recent years, particularly after the mass protests that followed the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini after her arrest allegedly over how she wore the mandated headscarf in Iran.\nKhamenei\u2019s use of Facebook has drawn criticism in the past. The social network has been banned in Iran since its 2009 disputed presidential election and the Green Movement protests that followed. Iran began blocking Instagram and Meta\u2019s WhatsApp messaging service after the protests over Amini's death.\nKhamenei still maintains an account on X, formerly Twitter.\nKhamenei and accounts associated with the supreme leader had been praising the Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw some 250 others taken hostage. Immediately after the attack, Khamenei backed Hamas in a speech, saying: \u201cWe kiss the hands of those who planned the attack on the Zionist regime.\"\nIran has provided arms and support to Hamas, though Tehran isn't believed to have directed the Oct. 7 attack. In the time since, Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip has killed over 27,000 Palestinians and sparked tensions across the wider Middle East. Iranian-backed militias like Lebanon's Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels, also armed by Iran, have launched attacks against Israel in the time since.\nJonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League praised Meta's decision.\n\u201cHe\u2019s used these platforms for years to incite violent antisemitism, to legitimize militant anti-zionism and to make genocidal threats,\u201d Greenblatt wrote online.\n"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc. META, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Micron Technology Inc. MU.\nThe Nasdaq Composite is back in action after an astonishing rally in 2023. The tech-heavy index soared 43.4% last year, recording its best year since 2020. The index\u2019s smooth rally suffered a small hurdle last month, although finally, it closed January on a positive note with a mere 1% gain.\nHowever, the tech-laden index has regained momentum in February. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite is up 8.3% compared with 6% gain of the S&P 500 and 2.5% of the Dow. Last week, the index advanced 2.4%, posting the fifth straight winning week and the 14th positive week in 15.\nThe tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. Some financial and technology experts believe that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe that the AI-space is yet to unfold in the U.S. and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies to produce high-end products.\nMoreover, the robust fundamentals of the U.S. economy reduce concerns of a near-term recession. Additionally, the blockbuster earnings in the last reported quarter of NVIDIA \u2014 the largest global manufacturer of generative AI chipsets \u2014 raised expectations of investors that the market for AI will show strong growth in the coming decade.\nTaiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. \u2014 the world's largest contract chipmaker \u2014 recently projected more than 20% revenue growth in 2024 on booming demand for high-end chips used in AI applications even as the broader industry faces weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\nThe World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (\u201cWSTS\u201d) projects robust growth in 2024, with an estimated surge of 13.1% annually. As estimated by WSTS, global semiconductor sales should reach $588.4 billion in 2024.\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\nGrand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\nOn Feb 9, the Biden administration announced an investment of $5 billion in a public-private consortium to support R&D activities in advanced computer chips. On Aug 9, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act. This legislation allots $50 billion to help computer chip manufacturers and ease the shortage of components vital for a range of industries.\nThe National Semiconductor Technology Center (\"NSTC\") was funded through this act with $39 billion allocated to chip manufacturers and $11 billion set aside for chip R&D purposes. The newly released $5 billion will also be given to NSTC as the government recognized NSTC as the centerpiece of the administration\u2019s R&D efforts.\nThe Biden administration has expressed concerns that the United States had a 39% share of global semiconductor and microelectronic production in 1990, which has drastically dropped to just 12% at present.\nWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite listed technology behemoths with solid exposure to AI. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nAmazon.com Inc. is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. The strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, a strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN\u2019s cloud dominance.\nAn expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN gain further momentum among customers. Robust Alexa skills and an expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. AMZN\u2019s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.4% and 39%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.\nMeta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\nMETA\u2019s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to drive growth. Reels continued to impress across both Instagram and Facebook backed by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\nMeta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.4% and 31.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.\nNVIDIA Corp. is gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. The datacenter end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\nA surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. The collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance NVDA\u2019s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVDA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 53.7% through fiscal 2024-2026.\nZacks Rank #2 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 54.7% and 64.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last seven days.\nMicrosoft Corp. has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues of MSFT rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues of MSFT were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.9% and 18.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.2% over the last 30 days.\nMicron Technology Inc. has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.\nThe expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU\u2019s chips used in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU\u2019s memory and storage.\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 42.8% and 90.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.3% over the last 30 days.\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\nIt\u2019s a little-known chemical company that\u2019s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.\nThis company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks\u2019 Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.\nFree: See Our Top Stock and 4 Runners Up >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

This week\u2019s list includes Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA.\nWe have seen some awe-inspiring results from Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon in recent days that reconfirm their leadership position in this market.\nThese companies, along with their peers in the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 group of stocks \u2013 Apple, Alphabet, Tesla and Nvidia \u2013 led the market higher last year, and that momentum has continued this year.\nOther than Tesla, whose results disappointed the market once again and reflected the fourth quarter in a row of disappointing results, all of the other Mag 7 members that have reported came out with impressive growth numbers. The market wasn\u2019t particularly impressed with the Alphabet and Apple reports, but they came out with Q4 earnings growth of +51.8% and +13.1%, respectively.\nTesla\u2019s earnings were down -45.8% in Q3 on +3.5% higher revenues, as the EV-maker continued to grapple with weakening margins in an increasingly competitive EV market.\nUsing estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its December-quarter results on February 21st, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +48.7% from the same period last year on +14.5% higher revenues.\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 28.6% of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 19.5% of the index\u2019s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 23.1% of all S&P 500 earnings.\nGiven their enormous earnings power and growth profiles, it is hard to argue with the group\u2019s market leadership. Importantly, analysts had been raising their estimates for the group even before the December-quarter results, with these numbers now adding to the positive revision momentum.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues.\nThis week\u2019s blockbuster Tech results has pushed the aggregate earnings growth picture for the S&P 500 index to +4.3% from last week\u2019s +1.1% growth pace. Excluding the contribution from the Mag 7 stocks, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -4.2%.\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, February 2nd, we now have Q4 results from 230 S&P 500 members, or 46% of the index\u2019s total membership.\nWe have more than 500 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members.

        "Text": "Meta Platforms' (META) stock rocketed higher on Friday, climbing more than 20% after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and guidance and announced new shareholder return initiatives.\nWith Friday's rally, the company added nearly $200 billion to its market cap, a stock market record according to Bloomberg data. Meta shares were trading around $475 on Friday; at its lows in 2022, the stock fell to as low as $90.\nMeta's market cap now stands north of $1.2 trillion.\nFor the fourth quarter, Meta reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.33 on revenue of $40.11 billion. Analysts were anticipating adjusted EPS of $4.94 on revenue of $39.01 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported revenue of $32.2 billion in the same quarter last year.\nThe company also boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion and initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. In the current quarter, Meta said it anticipates revenue of between $34.6 billion and $37 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations for revenues to tally $33.6 billion.\nMeta's advertising revenue came in at $38.7 billion in the fourth quarter, beating expectations for $37.8 billion. The company also reported 2.11 billion Facebook daily active users. Wall Street was anticipating 2.07 billion.\nThe company reported ad impressions rose 21% over last year during the period while the average price per ad fell 2%.\nMeta's Reality Labs, however, continues to be a burden on the company. The division, which is tasked with turning Zuckerberg\u2019s vision of the metaverse into a reality, lost another $4.65 billion, up from the $4.3 billion the company lost on the endeavor in the same period last year. Still, the division beat expectations on revenue, topping $1.07 billion versus an anticipated $812 million.\nThe launch of Apple\u2019s rival Vision Pro headset could create a jump in consumer interest in AR/VR headsets and generate a knock-on effect for Meta\u2019s Quest line of headsets.\nBut Meta's Reality Labs efforts have taken a backseat in the minds of investors amid increased investments in generative AI. In January, Zuckerberg announced in an Instagram Reels post that the company's long-term strategy was to develop general artificial intelligence and make it open source.\nThere's no single definition of generative AI, but broadly speaking, it\u2019s a kind of AI that can think and learn like a human. In other words, it's capable of understanding a multitude of concepts rather than specializing in a certain field.\nIn 2024, Meta expects its expenses to total $94 billion-$99 billion, with the company noting, among other things, that payroll costs will rise this year as it adds more staff in higher-cost, technical roles amid its push into AI features.\nMeta also disclosed that in 2023 restructuring charges, including severance and facilities consolidation, totaled $3.45 billion. The company's head count as of Dec. 31, 2023, stood at 67,317, down 22% over the prior year.\nMeta has been on a hot streak over the last 12 months, with shares rocketing 121% over that period and outperforming the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN).\nIn January, the company\u2019s market capitalization once again eclipsed the $1 trillion mark.\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "Text": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed cooperation on extended reality devices with LG Electronics executives on Wednesday as part of his visit to South Korea that highlights Meta's ambitions in artificial intelligence.\nSouth Korea is the second leg of Zuckerberg\u2019s three-nation Asian tour that observers say is meant to discuss partnerships with tech powerhouses and forge good relations with business and government leaders in the region. He already visited Japan and will travel to India later this week.\nOn Wednesday, Zuckerberg met LG Electronics CEO William Cho for two hours to talk about business strategies for extended reality \u2014 known as XR \u2014 device development, LG said in a statement.\nWhile experiencing Meta\u2019s latest virtual-reality headset, the Quest 3, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, Cho \u201cexpressed a keen interest in Meta\u2019s advanced technology demonstrations, notably focusing on Meta\u2019s large language models and its potential for on-device AI integration,\u201d the LG statement said.\nLG is ramping up its strategic collaboration with Meta, aiming to expedite its XR ventures, it said. XR includes augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality and other related technologies.\nLater Wednesday, Zuckerberg met Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Jae-yong, according to local media. He is scheduled to meet South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday.\n\u201cMeta already collaborated with high-end sunglasses brand Ray-Ban to launch smart glasses last year. Just like this, Meta could possibly want to introduce their XR technology to a worldwide customer base of a global consumer electronics maker like LG,\u201d said Kim Yang Paeng, a technology analyst at the Korea Institute of Economics and Technology.\nKim said Zuckerberg will also likely talk with Samsung about producing Meta-exclusive chips to ease its reliance on the AI chip market-dominant NVIDIA.\nZuckerberg's visit to Asia comes as Meta ramps up its efforts in artificial intelligence amid a race involving technology firms OpenAI, Google and Microsoft. In a Instagram reel in January, Zuckerberg said that it was Meta's \u201clong term vision to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit.\"\nMeta is building massive compute infrastructure \u2014 equivalent to 600k NVIDIA H100 GPUs' worth \u2014 to support its artificial intelligence plans as it begins training its Llama 3 generative AI model, he said in the reel. Generative AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot and Meta's Llama 3 are artificial intelligence systems that can generate content based on user prompts.\nLee Tae-kyu, an expert at the Korea Economic Research Institute, said Meta would think cooperation with Samsung and LG is important as they are top-level tech companies outside the United States. Samsung and LG, on the other hand, would also highly value partnerships with Meta, whose products target customers around the world.\nDuring his visit to Tokyo, Zuckerberg met Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and later told reporters: \u201cWe had a good productive conversation about AI and the future of technology, and I am really excited for the work that is happening here in Japan.\u201d\nHe was in Japan with his family for a trip that mixed business with pleasure. He went skiing with his family, visited a McDonald\u2019s outlet and learned how swords are made at a swordsmiths near Tokyo.\nDuring his visit to India, he will attend a wedding ceremony for the son of billionaire Mukesh Ambani, head of the oil and technology conglomerate Reliance Industries.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n"

        "Author": "  Jon Quast, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "On Feb. 1, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) reported its biggest and most profitable quarter in history. Its \"family of apps\" includes Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. And this trio absolutely delivered for shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nIn Q4, Meta's revenue grew 25% year over year. This was its best growth rate in over a year, boosting its full-year revenue to a whopping $135 billion.\nMeta Platforms' Facebook enjoyed user growth from around the world in Q4, finishing with 2.1 billion daily active users. Management was upbeat about the results for Instagram and WhatsApp as well. These apps primarily make money through advertising. And in Q4, ad impressions (the number of times an ad was displayed) were up a strong 21% year over year.\nMeta Platforms is clearly a business that revolves around advertising on its various social platforms. And this division of the business is extremely profitable, generating operating income of nearly $63 billion in 2023.\nHowever, Meta Platforms is betting the future of the company on something else entirely. And in 2023, this other division had an operating loss of more than $16 billion, worsening from its prior-year operating loss of almost $14 billion.\nWhen it comes to Meta's long-term vision, co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn't intend to sit back and just let the advertising profits pour in. In the Q4 earnings call, Zuckerberg addressed the long-term vision by saying, \"We have two major parts of our long-term vision, and in addition to AI the other part is the metaverse.\"\nThe metaverse is a fuzzy concept. But think of it as a digital world people experience through immersive hardware devices, such as virtual reality (VR) headsets. Inside the digital world, users can interact socially, have experiences, conduct commerce, and more.\nZuckerberg is all-in on the future of the metaverse, as evidenced by his decision to rebrand the entire company to Meta Platforms in 2021. It's also evidenced by how much money the company is investing in its Reality Labs business segment -- the part that involves its Metaverse vision.\nIn 2023, Meta's Reality Labs generated $1.9 billion in revenue (mostly hardware sales for its Quest headset device). But this segment racked up a $16.1 billion loss for the year.\nHere's another stat that may shock investors: From 2019 through 2023 (five full years of results), Meta Platforms generated just $8 billion in revenue from Reality Labs. However, its operating loss from Reality Labs over this period is over $51 billion.\nTo put that number into perspective, consider that the S&P 500 is an index comprised of the largest, most profitable U.S. companies. Occidental Petroleum is currently the 165th-largest company in the index.\u00a0Meta Platforms could have paid cash for this oil company with its metaverse losses alone.\nWith a market capitalization of nearly $1.2 trillion as of this writing, $51 billion over five years isn't that big of a number for Meta Platforms, as strange as that might sound. Granted, ongoing losses for that division and lackluster growth (it generated more metaverse revenue in 2021 than in 2023) aren't ideal. But relative to the size of the overall business, Meta can afford this gamble.\nThe problem with being a trillion-dollar company is that it will be hard for Meta Platforms to find market-beating growth. Simply put, it needs ginormous ideas, and the metaverse is a big enough possibility that it may be worth pursuing.\u00a0Many third-party research reports project that the metaverse will be worth hundreds of billions of dollars by 2030.\nMoreover, the technology for making the metaverse possible is improving all the time. Besides Meta's Quest headsets, Apple just launched its Vision Pro, which is being celebrated by the media -- award-winning filmmaker James Cameron praised the Vision Pro to the point of calling it a \"religious\" experience.\nEven Disney is getting in on the action by unveiling its HoloTile device -- a floor mat that allows VR users to walk around the digital space while staying in one place in the physical space.\nThe point is that metaverse technology is clearly improving. Meta Platforms' investments haven't paid off yet. But perhaps traction will come as the user experience improves.\nEven if it doesn't pay off, I'm not sure investors should be too hard on Meta Platforms here. Given the strength of its core business, it can afford to make a big long-term bet on the future. But one thing's for sure: If it's going to enjoy long-term market-beating growth from here, it needs a big bet to pay off.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Adam Spatacco, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "As earnings season kicks into gear, all eyes are on big tech. Why? Well, the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks all played an important role in the Nasdaq Composite's 43% surge last year, and momentum has gotten stronger in 2024, which has helped the S&P 500 soar to new highs.\nFollowing its fourth-quarter earnings report on Feb. 1, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) rocketed by more than 20% and re-entered the exclusive club of trillion-dollar companies.\nWhile progress in artificial intelligence (AI) applications is front and center for investors, Meta's management was sure to tame expectations amid the enthusiasm. Nevertheless, investors are cheering on the stock.\nLet's dig into two important developments outside of AI that may be influencing the recent price action.\nIn 2022, Meta had its eyes on a new growth driver called the metaverse. The company invested heavily in applications such as augmented and virtual reality, and bolstered its headcount significantly. Unfortunately, investors quickly soared on this strategy due to the toll these investments were taking on Meta's overall revenue and profits. The company's core advertising business stalled while expenses mounted, resulting in deteriorating cash flow. Unsurprisingly, Meta stock cratered by more than 60% in 2022.\nToward the end of 2022, a prominent venture capitalist (VC) named Brad Gerstner penned an open letter to Meta's executive leadership and board of directors. Gerstner urged the company \"get fit\" and return to its roots. Last year, Meta employed a series of layoffs to right-size its cost structure and turned its focus back to the advertising business.\nFor the full year 2023, Meta grew its revenue by 16% year over year and expanded its operating margins by 10 percentage points. The combination of accelerated revenue growth and margin expansion helped fuel growth in free cash flow by nearly 140% year over year.\nWith $65.4 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, Meta appears to be deploying this capital to reward shareholders in two ways.\nFirst, the company repurchased $20 billion of stock in 2023. Moreover, as of Dec. 31, Meta had roughly $31 billion available and authorized by the board for share repurchases. In addition, the company announced an increase of $50 billion to its share repurchase authorization during the earnings call.\nGiven where Meta stock began trading in 2023, coupled with the company's attractive valuation, it's not entirely surprising to see a buyback. However, the announcement of the $50 billion increase was encouraging to see as Meta appears to be well-positioned for the next phase of long-term growth fueled by artificial intelligence (AI).\nAlthough the share repurchase news was nice to see, it appears that Meta has found additional ways to deploy its excess profits. Perhaps more surprising was the announcement of the company's first dividend. Per the earnings release, Meta will pay a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share.\nThe company's CFO, Susan Li, commented on the development, saying that \"introducing a dividend really just serves as a nice complement to the existing share repurchase program.\"\nI see this as an important step for Meta as it matures. Generally speaking, growth companies typically do not pay dividends, as any excess cash that is generated tends to be reinvested in additional research and development (R&D) or marketing efforts. Meta is only the fourth Magnificent Seven\u00a0stock to pay a dividend -- joining Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia.\nWhen it comes to tech stocks, a lot of investors seem to be enamored of the prospects of artificial intelligence (AI), and rightfully so. The proliferation of generative AI can't be understated. However, prudent investors should realize that use cases for the technology are still very much in discovery territory, and the long-term gains for AI could be years away.\nIn the meantime, Meta has found other creative sources to rally investor enthusiasm. With accelerating revenue, margins, and cash flow, Meta is showing some true signs of a healthy, maturing business. Moreover, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of roughly 23 is nearly identical to that of the S&P 500. This could signal that investors do not think Meta's growth prospects are more attractive than the broader market's.\nI see Meta as an attractive opportunity at its current valuation, and think using dollar-cost averaging to scoop up some shares could be a wise decision in the long-run. The combination of share repurchases and a dividend certainly make the company stand out among its cohort, and the stock looks tempting for AI investors in particular.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Meta Platforms outlined a $50 billion stock-buyback plan Thursday.\nThat signals to investors that execs feel good about the social media giant's business prospects.\nDeutsche Bank expects listed companies to spend $1 trillion buying their own shares in 2024.\nMeta Platforms' stellar results Thursday added an exclamation point to Mark Zuckerberg's \"Year of Efficiency\" \u2013 and served up a reminder of one factor that could drive the market higher in 2024.\nAs well as issuing its first dividend, the Facebook parent outlined plans to increase its stock-buyback program by $50 billion.\nMeta isn't alone in flexing its muscles by signaling it'll spend money buying back its own shares this year.\nBuybacks tumbled 15% to about $800 billion last year, according to data from Goldman Sachs, with listed companies taking a cautious stance on the economy after the Federal Reserve jacked up interest rates in a bid to tame inflation.\nBut Deutsche Bank strategists expect that figure to rebound to $1 trillion in 2024, powered higher by stronger earnings and better market sentiment.\nHomebuilder Lennar, natural gas company ONEOK, defense firm Northrop Grumman, and Wall Street bank Wells Fargo have all announced billion-dollar stock buybacks this year.\nOn Thursday, Meta joined the party when it announced buybacks worth $50 billion, having already announced a $40 billion investment in its own shares last year.\nIts move sends a clear signal to investors that executives like Zuckerberg feel good about the company's business prospects \u2013\u00a0after all, a listed firm wouldn't want to buy its own shares if it thought their value was likely to fall.\nThe buybacks come off the back of a brilliant year for the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, which racked up triple-digit gains in 2023 thanks to its cost-cutting efforts, as well as general investor excitement about artificial intelligence.\nMeta climbed another 17% Friday, putting its market capitalization on course to surge another $170 billion at the opening bell.\n\"It's a double whammy of good news for investors \u2013 not only are Meta considered the future of the global economy, but they're also providing dividends and billion-dollar buybacks,\" Kathleen Brooks of XTB told Business Insider. \"The alchemy of it just makes for the perfect stock.\"\nThat positivity spreading across the S&P 500 could help the benchmark index, up 3% so far in 2024, to eke out further gains.\nRead the original article on Business Insider\n"

        "Title": "META, AMZN, MSFT: Which Stock Is Best after Their Magnificent Earnings?",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "The so-called Magnificent Seven have pulled the curtain on their earnings results. Though most Magnificent Seven members clocked in some magnificent quarters, there was one EV maker that delivered results that can only be described as less-than-magnificent. In any case, this piece will focus on a trio of Magnificent Seven members (META, AMZN, and MSFT) that stepped up to the plate and swung one out of the ballpark, sparking an impressive rally alongside a wave of analyst price target upgrades.\nTherefore, let\u2019s use TipRanks\u2019 Comparison Tool to check in with the three aforementioned stocks that delivered and could continue to do so in the year ahead, thanks in part to a bit of help from their growing stake in artificial intelligence (AI).\nMeta Platforms delivered the most impressive quarterly results this earnings season, sparking one of the biggest single-day rallies in the company\u2019s history. Undoubtedly, Meta stock\u2019s more than 20% surge represented the largest-ever single-day market cap gain of $204.5 billion. Put that one in the record books.\nWith a fresh dividend, AI tailwinds at its back, and the wildcard of its Reality Labs business, many analysts on Wall Street see the red-hot stock climbing even higher as it enters its dividend-paying era. All things considered, I find it hard to be any less bullish following the latest spike.\nIn fact, Morgan Stanley seems to think Meta is a stock to keep buying after its blowout earnings results. The company\u2019s new AI tools are just one of the drivers that has the bank staying bullish. In a prior piece, I highlighted the potential of ad automation tool Advantage+ and its ability to give the ad business a real shot in the arm.\nJust because Meta is maturing, with a dividend to pay (0.44% yield at writing), does not mean it\u2019s steering off the growth track. If anything, Meta may be the most exciting Magnificent Seven member, given how effectively Mark Zuckerberg and his team have turned a corner following its \u201cYear of Efficiency.\u201d\nAs the company moves into a year (or should I say decade) of AI, the stock certainly seems too cheap at 23.7 times forward price-to-earnings, far below most Magnificent Seven members. The lowest-hanging fruit may have been picked amid last year\u2019s efficiency push, but don\u2019t expect management to settle into cruise mode as it looks to pull ahead in the so-called AI race while keeping up with peers in the virtual- and augmented-reality scene.\nMeta stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 38 Buys, two Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average META stock price target\u00a0of $522.00 implies 11.2% upside potential.\nAmazon stock has also been riding higher following its own slate of quarterly earnings results. The numbers were exceptional, helping power shares more than 7% higher in a single trading session. With new all-time highs in sight (around 8% away), plenty of AI rally fuel, and a strong holiday season in the books, analysts seem right on the money to stay bullish on the stock post-earnings.\nLike Meta, Amazon wants to equip advertisers with the right tools. With the firm launching new privacy tools in the European market while starting ads (and a paid option to eliminate them) on its streaming service Prime Video, it seems positioned to make a growing dent in the ad market.\nIndeed, Amazon\u2019s many Prime users will not be happy to have to view ads as they enjoy their paid Prime content. And though some may question the value proposition of being a Prime member (have the perks added up, or only the price hikes?), the consumer will speak with their money. For now, Prime looks sticky enough to not shed too many users due to the inclusion of ads on Prime Video.\nCombine AI tools with ads, and it\u2019s no mystery as to why RBC Capital views Amazon as one of its top tech picks (one of the others is Meta) to play the digital ad market in the new year. I think they\u2019re right to praise the company as it looks to go above and beyond just being an e-commerce and cloud retailer.\nAmazon stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with unanimous 40 Buys assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average AMZN stock price target\u00a0of $207.72 implies 21.8% upside potential.\nMicrosoft also stood tall following its earnings report, with investors impressed by the company\u2019s AI muscles. In many ways, Microsoft is still the AI stock to own for those who prefer to bet on software over hardware. While Microsoft is poised to gain some skin in the AI chip game, the company still remains a software titan that\u2019s likely to continue having its way with rivals.\nWith a Super Bowl ad for its AI software CoPilot ready to go, it will be interesting to see where adoption of the Microsoft ecosystem goes from here as more are drawn in by its impressive AI capabilities. It\u2019s hard not to be bullish, even with shares at fresh highs and a trailing price-to-earnings multiple now well above 35 times.\nApart from AI, Microsoft seems to be opening up its Xbox gaming ecosystem by sharing plans to bring its Xbox-exclusive games over to its rival console, PlayStation. Indeed, such a move could curb demand for its console while also dealing a heavy blow to the so-called \u201cconsole wars.\u201d\nThat said, by expanding the total addressable market for its games, I view the move as a net positive, even if it rubs some Xbox gamers the wrong way. If the friendly gesture is reciprocated by Sony (the firm behind PlayStation), the move could be a net positive for both console combatants as more emphasis is placed on growth in software.\nMicrosoft stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 32 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average MSFT stock price target\u00a0of $469.45 implies 13.4% upside potential.\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks could continue higher if they continue smashing quarterly earnings this year. Undoubtedly, AI could be the magic that helps them keep pulling rabbits out of hats come future earnings seasons. Of the trio, analysts see the most upside (21.8%) in AMZN stock.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "Better Tech Stock: Meta Platforms vs. Alphabet",

        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) headed in opposite directions after their latest earnings reports. Meta's stock soared 20% to an all-time high on Feb. 2, after the social media giant followed up its big fourth-quarter earnings beat with rosy guidance for the first quarter, a $50 billion boost to its buyback plan, and the initiation of its first-ever dividend. Alphabet's stock sank 8% on Jan. 31, even though its fourth-quarter numbers easily cleared analysts' expectations with double-digit growth across its core businesses.\nAs of this writing, Meta's stock has rallied more than 150% over the past 12 months. Alphabet's stock has rallied just over 30%. Let's see why the bulls rushed to Meta instead of Alphabet -- and if that trend will continue throughout the rest of 2024.\nMeta and Alphabet both generate most of their revenue from digital ads, but their business models are different. Meta is the world's largest social media company, and 3.98 billion people use at least one of its core apps -- Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- every month. It sells its ads across all four platforms, as well as its Audience Network for third-party apps and websites. It's also producing augmented and virtual reality devices through its Reality Labs segment.\nAlphabet's Google owns the world's largest search engine, the top streaming video platform in YouTube, and the most popular mobile operating system in Android. It also owns the world's third largest cloud infrastructure platform, sells its own first-party hardware devices, and develops self-driving vehicles through its Waymo subsidiary.\nGoogle and Facebook controlled 39% and 18% of the global digital advertising market in terms of annual revenue, respectively, in 2023. But both companies face stiff competition from ByteDance's TikTok, which claimed 3% of the market and continues to lock in younger audiences with its short videos. To counter TikTok, Google has been beefing up YouTube Shorts, while Meta has been expanding its similar Reels across Facebook and Instagram.\nMeta and Alphabet generated 98% and 77% of their revenue, respectively, from digital ads in 2023. Both companies struggled with slower ad sales in 2022, as the macro headwinds drove more businesses to rein their ad spending.\nMeta also struggled with Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) privacy changes on iOS, which made it tougher to craft targeted ads from third-party data. Google wasn't as affected by the iOS update, because it mainly relied on first-party data and already paid Apple billions of dollars each year to remain the default search engine on iOS. But despite all of those challenges, Meta's ad revenue grew at a much faster rate than Google's over the past year.\nMetric\nQ4 2022\nQ1 2023\nQ2 2023\nQ3 2023\nQ4 2023\nMeta ad revenue growth (YOY)\n(4%)\n4%\n12%\n24%\n24%\nGoogle ad revenue growth (YOY)\n(4%)\n0%\n3%\n9%\n11%\nData source: Company earnings reports. YOY = Year over year.\nMeta outperformed Google for three reasons. First, Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies significantly ramped up their spending on Facebook and Instagram to reach more overseas users. Second, Meta countered Apple's changes by gathering more first-party data and upgrading its AI algorithms. Lastly, its higher ad impressions offset its lower ad prices.\nGoogle didn't seem to attract as much spending from those Chinese companies, and declining impressions across its sprawling ad network partly offset its rising impressions across its core search engine and YouTube. Google's growing dependence on ad-free subscriptions for YouTube and YouTube Music also suggested its advertising business was running out of steam. Meanwhile, Google's closely watched cloud business continued to grow at a slower rate than its larger rival, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure, which implied it was falling behind in the cutthroat cloud and AI race.\nMeta's rising ad revenue, layoffs, and other cost-cutting measures boosted its operating margin from 25% in 2022 to 35% in 2023, even as it ramped up its spending in its unprofitable Reality Labs business. Alphabet also executed several rounds of layoffs, but its operating margin rose from 26% in 2022 to just 27% in 2023.\nAnalysts expect Meta's revenue and earnings to grow 12% and 18%, respectively, in 2024. Based on those estimates, which might need to be raised after Meta's latest earnings beat, its stock doesn't look particularly expensive at 28 times forward earnings. Its forward yield of 0.4% won't attract any serious investors, but it's a clear sign that it can continue to generate a stable profit while expanding its metaverse ecosystem.\nAnalysts expect Alphabet's revenue and earnings to rise 11% and 17%, respectively, in 2024. It doesn't pay a dividend yet, but its stock looks a bit cheaper at 21 times forward earnings. However, concerns about its advertising business and its ability to keep pace with Microsoft in the AI race could continue to compress its near-term valuations.\nIt's a close call, but I believe Meta will continue to outperform Alphabet this year as its advertising growth accelerates and it expands its operating margin. Its simpler business model could also make it more appealing for growth-oriented investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.
