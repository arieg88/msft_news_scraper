        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "The earnings season for the June quarter has been quite volatile for large-cap tech firms. With challenging comparisons due to rapid growth driven by AI in recent years, investors have been focusing on how companies\u00a0manage to\u00a0expand margins while increasing capital expenditures. As a long-term Meta Platforms (META) bull, I remain optimistic, as the company\u2019s Q2 results not only exceeded expectations but also surpassed those of other AI tech giants, helping it be an outperformer this earnings season.\nMeta\u2019s Q3 guidance further boosts confidence, indicating that AI spending is positively impacting short-term results despite tough comparisons, which strengthens the long-term bull case. In this article, I\u2019ll review Meta\u2019s key Q2 highlights and explain why its approach to AI\u00a0appears to be\u00a0effective, addressing both short-term concerns and long-term expectations for shareholders.\nWhen I wrote about Meta\u2019s earnings expectations in a previous article, I took a cautious stance due to the typical volatility after earnings. As expected, volatility hit, but this time, it was positive for META\u2019s bulls.\nMeta\u2019s performance was less surprising, given its recent track record of beating estimates. Still, it\u2019s impressive, considering the tough comparisons. For Q2, analysts expected a 20% revenue increase, down from 27% in Q1. Meanwhile, Meta delivered $39.1 billion in revenue, a 22% annual increase, surpassing Wall Street\u2019s $38.3 billion forecast.\nThis growth indicates that Meta is capturing more market share in advertising as advertisers shift from traditional methods to digital platforms like Instagram and Facebook. The success of Meta\u2019s short-form video platform, Reels, in countering TikTok\u2019s popularity also plays a role.\nRevenue growth led to a 58% jump in operating income, which reached $14.8 billion from $9.4 billion last year. With an operating profit margin of 38%, Meta\u2019s model is impressive, especially considering that most of its services are free.\nDespite its massive market share, Meta increased its family daily active users by 7%, hitting 3.27 billion. This broad user base and increased engagement provide a strong competitive edge. Ad impressions across its apps grew by 10% year-over-year, reflecting higher user engagement and more ads being shown.\nNotably, Meta achieved these strong operational metrics with fewer employees. The company reduced its headcount by 7,800 in Q2, highlighting Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s effective cost management and contributing to the significant rise in operating income.\nA key concern for Q2 across Big Tech, especially amid the AI boom, were capital expenditures (CapEx) and guidance for both the top and bottom lines. For instance, major players like Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) disappointed investors with high spending on AI\u00a0that did\u00a0not lead to a corresponding increase in cloud segment margins.\nConsequently, the big question becomes, what return will Meta see from this spending, and when will those benefits materialize?\nTo answer that question, it\u2019s important to note that Meta\u2019s focus\u00a0on\u00a0AI is to improve its ad business and consumer behavior on its platforms. Then, secondarily, the company expects to drive revenue growth by scaling up new AI-based products like Meta AI and AI Studio.\nGiven this clear focus, Meta\u2019s Q3 outlook helped alleviate concerns about inconsistent returns. The company projected revenues between $38.5 billion and $41 billion for Q3, signaling a 20% increase despite tough comparisons. This has sent a message that the AI investments are already paying off, particularly in how Meta manages CapEx and operating expenses.\nAdditionally, Meta raised its annual CapEx forecast from $35\u2013$40 billion to $37\u2013$40 billion, but this didn\u2019t negatively impact the stock price. The stock performed well, jumping around 7% after the Q2 results, while other Big Tech peers, except for Apple (AAPL), saw share prices fall following earnings reports.\nMeta also warned that CapEx will increase even more by 2025. While this sounds significant, the current data doesn\u2019t indicate long-term concern. On the contrary, Meta is seeing revenue growth, more daily active users, and increased ad impressions, all pointing to higher user engagement and effective AI recommendations.\nThe bottom line is that, in my opinion, Meta is currently the top-performing Big Tech company when it comes to managing AI growth expectations. It has adeptly balanced shareholders\u2019 short-term expectations with its long-term growth ambitions.\nIn fact, Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia\u2014referred to as the \u201cGodfather of AI\u201d by tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush\u2014has credited Meta Platforms and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, with leading the field of AI. This recognition is due to Meta AI\u2019s integration across the company\u2019s social media platforms and the successful launch of Llama 3.1, an open-source AI project.\nAt the same time, investors in Meta should be prepared for price swings and an aggressive investment strategy. While Meta posted strong Q2 results despite tough comps, challenges are expected to grow each quarter. With CapEx rising until at least 2025, the future returns of this high spending remain uncertain.\nCurrently, META stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 24x, near its five-year average of 23x. I believe this valuation is reasonable for long-term investors, but short-term volatility may still occur.\nMeta Platforms stock is rated a Strong Buy by Wall Street analysts. Out of 28 analysts covering the stock, only two are bearish, two are neutral, and the remaining 24 are bullish. 12 analysts have raised their price targets for META, with the average META stock price target now at $549.35. This suggests upside potential of 6.7% based on the latest share price.\nSee more META analyst ratings\nMeta delivered a solid quarter recently, surpassing market estimates and offering promising Q3 guidance despite tough comparisons ahead. This performance indicates that its AI investments have already paid off and will likely continue to benefit the company in the latter half of the year. Currently, Meta stands out among Big Tech firms for its effective balance of short-term growth and long-term potential amid the AI boom.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 17 Latest AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks under hedge funds' radar.\nIt is no surprise that companies in the United States and China are leading the rest of the world when it comes to artificial intelligence. Conservative estimates about the impact of AI on the global economy, made by market experts at professional services firm PwC, reveal that AI-related gains, equal to close to $11 trillion, will account for nearly 70% of total global economic impact by 2030. In China, AI is expected to contribute to a nearly 26% boost to the GDP within the next six years, while this figure in the US will likely be 15%. AI no doubt represents the biggest commercial investment opportunity in this fast-paced world economy.\nSmart companies are seizing on this opportunity. According to market research firm IDC, investments in AI infrastructure will cross $30 billion this year and are projected to grow to $47 billion by 2028. This represents approximately 30% of the total global spending in AI. One of the most prominent AI use cases is in the customer service world. In this area, global businesses have spent more than $16 billion in 2024 so far. The impact of these investments in AI will be significant down the road. AI is likely to contribute to a $15 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030, up 14% from current levels.\nLike other sectors of the economy, Wall Street is no stranger to AI. The debut of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked the beginning of the AI revolution in the world of finance. Since then, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), sales of software, hardware, and services for AI systems have climbed rapidly and will top $400 billion in 2027. Financial sector spending is likely to double to nearly $100 billion in 2027, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 30% \u2014 the fastest of five major industries. Hedge funds, often the pioneers of cutting-edge technology, are embracing generative AI as well.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The firm recently beat market expectations on earnings for both the top and bottom lines, but left some investors concerned after it raised guidance for capital expenditures. The increased guidance for 2024, now up to $37 billion to $40 billion, reflected the rather large investments in the AI space. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said the firm was working hard to figure out the level of infrastructure needed to train advanced AI models as it looked at the compute clusters and data it needed to train future Meta AI products.\nThis level of commitment towards AI and the historical financial track record of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), which has over 3.2 billion daily active users across the platforms it owns and was able to grow twice as fast as rival Alphabet in the digital ad market space in the second quarter, has earned bullish calls from Wall Street. Investment bank UBS has a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $635.\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the best AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Technology Stocks to Buy for Long Term.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other technology stocks.\nThe technology industry is one of the key drivers of the global economy. According to MGI research, the global technology industry was valued at $8.51 trillion in 2022 and is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.75% to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. In the United States alone the information technology industry drives more than one-third of the national economy.\nOne of the latest trends in the tech industry has been the increasing investments in artificial intelligence by both tech giants and start-up companies. According to a July 3 report by Reuters, the US venture capital funding surged to $55.6 billion during the second quarter of 2024. The funding surged more than 47% on a quarterly basis and was mainly driven by significant investments in artificial intelligence companies including $6 billion raised by Elon Musk\u2019s xAI.\nHowever, over the past few months, the technology sector has seen a major sell-off due to what analysts call an \u201cAI bubble\u201d. The sell-off initiated with investors raising concerns over return on investment regarding the premium they have been paying as capital expenditure on artificial intelligence. On August 5, CNBC reported that the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d US tech companies lost a combined $1 trillion market value at the start of the trading day. As a result, NASDAQ was down 3%, marking the index\u2019s steepest three-week slide in two years.\nWe recently covered the AI tech bubble in detail in 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst. Here\u2019s a glimpse of the article:\n\u201cIn the past few weeks, a major selloff in the technology sector, mostly over concerns about return on investments amid ballooning capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), has hit the stock market, sending valuations crashing and igniting fears of an AI bubble at the marketplace that might be about to burst. However, Stacy Rasgon, who has covered semiconductor stocks, one of the most prominent sectors in the AI world, for over fifteen years, has advised investors to stay the course, terming fears of a bubble as overblown. Rasgon claims that even though chances of an air pocket, used to refer to stock plunges, are 100%, he is confident the time for them is not now. He pointed to the very real and massive AI data center build as an example, predicting it would go on for a few years, helping push AI stocks higher.\u201d\nMichael Landsberg, Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth CIO appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the AI bubble. He believes that the AI bubble hasn\u2019t popped yet and what we saw recently was a reset of the market, where the market resets out-of-sync factors, and does not mean that the analysts are not positive about AI. He further added that a lot of AI companies have had a great past six months and are growing their earnings. He believes that ultimately earnings drive any stock and as far as AI stocks are concerned their earnings are growing and will continue to grow, thereby increasing the price.\nMoreover, Steve Eisman, Neuberger Berman Senior Portfolio Manager appeared on another CNBC interview termed the recent events as a \u201cPsychological Rotation\u201d. He mentioned that this was not a fundamental rotation, which could have been troublesome, rather it is a psychological rotation that will not hold for long. He further mentioned that Artificial intelligence is here to stay for years and he still sees massive growth opportunities for companies investing in AI.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of 10 best technology stocks to buy for the long term we used the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners. We searched for technology stocks and sorted them based on their market capitalization. From these stocks, we selected technology stocks that have been in business for 20 years or more and are expected to stay in business for several decades. Once we had the consolidated list, we ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the owner of the world's most engaging social media apps namely Facebook and Instagram, and two of the most commonly used messaging apps, WhatsApp and Messenger. The company is now eyeing to become a leader in AI chatbots. The stock was held by 219 hedge funds during Q2 2024, with total stakes worth $42.54 billion. Citadel Investment Group is the top shareholder of the company, with a position worth $6.27 billion.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has proved to be a leading technology company through its decade-long history of generating record revenues. Over the past 10 years the company has grown its top line by 31%, its bottom line by 36% and its levered free cash flow by 26%.\nMuch like its historic growth, the company continued to deliver robust growth during the most recent quarter i.e. Q2 2024. Its revenue grew 22% year-over-year to reach $39.1 billion. Management believes that two main factors drive revenue for the company. Number one is its ability to deliver an engaging experience and the second is its effective monetization of the engagement. And the quarterly results show that the company performed well in both the indicators.\nThe advertisement revenue was also up 22% year-over-year to reach $38.3 billion. On the other hand, even after being in business for a long time, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) still witnessed an increase in daily active users which surpassed 3.2 billion, with WhatsApp alone reaching over 100 million monthly active users.\nThe company is now focusing on artificial intelligence to enhance user experience and challenge the Magnificent Seven to become the most used AI assistant. The competitive edge of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) lies in the fact that AI is not one of its core businesses.\nYes, you read it right. The fact that AI is its core business and instead it generates most of the revenues from core social media platforms gives the company leverage to work on its AI large language model without the threat of losing revenue. Management has leveraged this edge to gain another strategic advantage by making its Llama model code open-source, allowing outside developers to make optimizations and improvements. Management believes open-source has the potential to improve the company\u2019s language model much faster as compared to closed-sourced models.\nIn addition, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Ray-Ban Meta Glasses and Quest 3 have become a hit sooner than expected and are contributing revenue growth to its Reality Labs division. The Reality Labs division witnessed a 27.8% year-over-year increase in revenue, amounting to $353 million during the quarter.\nBased on the strong performance across the board, the net income also improved by an impressive 73% to reach more than 13 million. Moreover, the company also generated around $10.9 billion in free cash flow, giving it financial backing to invest in its AI ventures and return to its shareholders. Looking ahead, management believes next quarter revenue to be between $38.5 to $41 billion.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot,\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best technology stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META): The Best Magnificent Seven Stock?",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (META) is arguably the best Magnificent Seven stock\u00a0right now\u00a0and presents a buying opportunity, in my view.\u00a0The social media company\u2019s ad revenue and user base continue\u00a0to grow, and the valuation leaves\u00a0plenty of\u00a0room for error. The recent earnings report and long-term performance make me bullish on the stock.\nMeta Platforms\u2019 net income has been soaring in recent quarters, which has prompted the social media giant to offer its first quarterly dividend this year. Profits continued in that direction, with a 73% year-over-year increase in the\u00a0second quarter.\nEfficiency has been a\u00a0key\u00a0contributor to the company\u2019s rising profits.\u00a0That\u2019s code for firing more employees, but significant cuts weren\u2019t present\u00a0in\u00a0this quarter.\u00a0While\u00a0Q1 2024\u00a0featured a 10% year-over-year decline in headcount, the second quarter only saw a 1%\u00a0year-over-year\u00a0decline in this area.\nMeta Platforms\u2019 ability to retain workers while delivering robust net income growth can position it well in the future. A downside to firing many workers is the loss of talent and the difficulties of replacing people who left. Seeing\u00a0that downside less present in the second quarter while net income continued to soar is an encouraging development.\nFacebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are three\u00a0of the\u00a0top social media platforms \u2014 all owned by Meta. Even though these platforms are well-known, they continue to attract new users. Meta Platforms reported a 7% year-over-year increase in daily active users across its family of apps. As a result of high user growth, the company closed out the quarter with 3.27 billion daily active users.\nA rising user base allows Meta Platforms to provide more ad placements for corporations, small businesses, and influencers. Those extra ad spots can help Meta Platforms deliver elevated revenue growth for several years.\nA stock\u2019s valuation is a key component of the analysis after considering the fundamentals. Meta Platforms certainly delivers with a 27.5x P/E ratio.\u00a0There are\u00a0many companies with a similar valuation\u00a0that\u00a0aren\u2019t\u00a0delivering\u00a073% year-over-year net income growth for their investors.\nAlphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) is the only Magnificent Seven stock that trades at a lower valuation, and its year-over-year net income growth pales\u00a0in comparison\u00a0to Meta Platforms. Furthermore, Facebook\u2019s parent company should continue to benefit from rising revenue and profits, which should bring down the P/E ratio even more.\nIt\u2019s also good to note that Meta Platforms\u2019 net income growth has outpaced its year-to-date stock gains. Meta Platforms stock is up 49% year-to-date, which is supported by rising profits.\nMeta Platforms isn\u2019t only catering to growth investors. The company\u2019s recent dividend program\u00a0now\u00a0makes it an appealing pick for dividend growth investors. While Meta Platforms only has a 0.37% yield, it has the financial growth and cash position to support an annualized double-digit dividend growth rate for many years.\nFor instance, Meta Platforms closed out the quarter with $58.08 billion in cash. It has plenty of resources to support dividend hikes over time, but Meta Platforms doesn\u2019t even have to tap into those reserves for the dividend program.\nThe company distributed $1.27 billion to its investors as dividend payments\u00a0this quarter.\u00a0During the same quarter,\u00a0Meta Platforms allocated $6.32 billion toward its stock buyback.\u00a0Shifting some of the buyback funds to dividend distributions is sufficient to hike the dividend by at least 10% per year for several years, but it\u2019s\u00a0better for tax purposes that the capital goes toward stock buybacks.\nWhile we\u2019ve covered Meta Platforms\u2019 net income growth rate, the company\u2019s total GAAP profit\u00a0came in at\u00a0$13.5 billion this quarter. That\u2019s enough cash to support elevated dividends in the years ahead. Thus, Meta Platforms has the making of a dividend growth stock that outperforms the market while raising its dividend considerably over the years. That setup should attract many dividend investors as it becomes more apparent.\nMeta Platforms\u00a0is\u00a0currently\u00a0rated\u00a0as a Strong Buy on TipRanks based on 24 Buys, two Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The\u00a0average META stock price target\u00a0suggests 4.2% upside from current levels, but\u00a0that\u2019s a reflection of\u00a0Meta Platforms\u2019 recent stock gains. The highest price target of $645 per share, which was assigned today, suggests\u00a0that the\u00a0stock can gain an additional 22% from current levels.\nSee more META analyst ratings\nMeta Platforms has delivered incredible revenue and net income growth for its investors in recent quarters. Further, expanding profit margins have trimmed the stock\u2019s P/E ratio, even as it has continued to outperform the market. Additionally, Meta Platforms continues to grow its user base, which will support higher revenue in the future.\nIt was encouraging to see Meta Platforms grow its net income by 73% year-over-year while retaining most of its employees. It\u2019s a sign that the company doesn\u2019t have to rely on job cuts to generate more profits. Many analysts believe Meta Platforms can continue to deliver gains for long-term investors, and I am in agreement with them.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other important AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence has led to a much-needed market rally in the technology industry over the past year. The benchmark S&P 500, dominated by tech giants, is up nearly 20% in the past year. The tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite is up over 21%. In light of easing inflation numbers and rate cuts, market analysts had forecast a jump in interest around growth options for 2024. However, the AI buzz has served to snowball this ordinary interest into an extraordinary wave of optimism around the whole economy. Although tech stocks have been the biggest beneficiary, there is little doubt that AI will soon penetrate other sectors of the economy, from manufacturing and supply chain, to transportation, entertainment, and retail.\nThere are numbers that illustrate this argument in quantifiable terms. Across the economic spectrum, investments in AI are increasing at a rapid pace. For example, according to a recent report on the AI industry by renowned investment bank Goldman Sachs, established businesses around the world are expected to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years. Investments in AI startups are also booming. So far in 2024, venture capital firms have made around 200 deals with AI firms, investing nearly $22 billion. The average size of a round of funding for AI startups is more than $100 million with an average valuation of more than $1 billion. In contrast, these numbers for non-AI startups are $20 million and $200 million.\nKey players who were early to catch on to the AI trend have leapfrogged competitors. Stocks of companies that make graphics processing units (GPUs), specialized AI chips, and generative AI products have soared. In general, the median returns of AI-linked firms on the S&P 500 are 20% compared to 2% for non-AI stocks. On the NASDAQ Composite, AI firms are responsible for 90% of the overall returns on the border index. Analysts expect these gains to translate into earnings and GDP growth. Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, argues that in the next ten years, AI is likely to automate 25% of all work tasks and raise US productivity by 9% and GDP growth by more than 6%.\nResearch presented in the keynote address to the 2024 EMW Conference by Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management suggests that these gains may be the beginning of a new super cycle for the tech industry, following previous cycles such as PCs in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s that led to the popularity of the cloud. However, investors have more reason to be optimistic about this growth since it compares favorably to cycles of the past. Software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan contend that tech companies seem to be investing in AI products by tying the spending to the revenues, ensuring a safety net that had not existed in previous cycles.\nSince the beginning of the AI wave in early 2023 following the launch of ChatGPT by California-based Open AI, the focus of the industry has shifted from software towards AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure firms have added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since the first quarter of 2023. Before a killer AI application can emerge or large scale AI automation can begin - Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist at MIT, predicts this will take more than a decade - new areas of AI infrastructure are emerging. These include utilities, energy, internet, and industrials (see 20 Industrial Stocks That Are Already Riding the AI Wave). The gains of prominent utility, industrial, energy, and internet firms critical to AI development rival the returns of traditional AI stocks.\nInvestments in energy and utilities are important if this AI potential is to be realized. Goldman analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect the proliferation of AI technology and the accompanying need to maintain data centers to drive an increase in demand for utilities that has not been seen in a generation. It remains to be seen, however, if the pace at which AI is progressing will keep pace with investments in power. This is because the utilities sector is highly regulated and has supply chain constraints that will not be easily overcome. If investments are made at the levels needed, it might still be a few years before their full benefits make their way towards AI firms.\nAll this hullabaloo around AI has investors on edge, with ghosts of previous bubbles haunting their memories. Although comparisons to the past are the surest way of finding your footing in unfamiliar territory, data shows that this may not be the wisest strategy considering present market dynamics. For example, at the height of the dotcom bubble just before the turn of the millennium, some software firms were trading at 132x their earnings. The five-year average for this value in 1999 was only 37x. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks were trading at P/E multiples of around 39x. The five-year average for this last year was 40x, showcasing why AI valuations may not be overextended.\nIndeed, AI firms can target multi-trillion dollar valuations, in line with some of the biggest software and internet firms on the market presently. That is the revolutionary power of AI technology. Over the past decade, tech giants have achieved a scale that few other businesses have before them. By combining billions in users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income, these handful of firms have reached 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. They are category leaders in fields such as smartphones, ecommerce, cloud, and software as a service (SaaS) - all of which AI promises to disrupt - and ahead of competitors in research and development spending. This is why many of these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business models, in hopes of holding onto their thrones.\nSome investors remain concerned about AI firms bullying software companies on the market in the near and long term. A cursory glance at the Price-to-Sale (PS) ratios for software stocks in the past decade reveals that after topping out in 2021, the valuations for SaaS firms are near their all time lows. Some of this pessimism around software can also be attributed to slower earnings growth. Coatue research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS stocks expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% at the peak of the Saas craze. As the future of human-machine interaction moves towards communication in natural language, software firms who adapt to AI changes are more likely to survive than those that do not.\nAs the markets become decoupled from rate hikes, inflation figures go down, and the prospects of a soft landing become brighter, the macro outlook for AI looks favorable as well. The main driver for future S&P 500 growth in terms of earnings remains AI. According to Coatue research, in the next three years, AI-linked stocks will grow at a compound annual rate of almost 20%, beating their non-AI counterparts by nearly 14 percentage points. 40% of the earnings from tech will be accelerated by AI tailwinds in the period. All indicators point towards a brighter future for AI investors in the long term.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI infrastructure stocks with more than 25% gains in 2024 that are also popular among hedge funds.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of 16 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nIn recent months, the AI industry has been presenting explosive opportunities in the development and deployment of AI infrastructure. Companies that provide AI chips, cloud services, and data storage solutions are poised to benefit from the growing demand for AI capabilities. For example, NVIDIA, a leading provider of AI chips, has seen the shares rally by 160% in 2024, driven by the increasing need for powerful processing capabilities in AI applications. Similarly, cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are seeing a surge in demand for their AI and machine learning services, making them attractive options for investors.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nHowever, in this buzz around the new tech, investors should also stop and consider some of the risks and challenges associated with AI. Regulatory scrutiny on AI firms is intensifying, particularly around issues of data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the ethical use of AI. Governments worldwide are beginning to implement regulations that could impact how AI technologies are developed and deployed. For instance, the European Union has proposed an AI Act that seeks to create a regulatory framework that addresses the risks associated with AI while promoting innovation. This regulatory environment could lead to increased compliance costs and slower adoption rates in certain sectors, posing a potential risk for investors.\nAnother critical consideration for investors is the talent shortage in the AI industry. The demand for skilled AI professionals far outstrips supply, leading to fierce competition among companies for top talent. This talent gap could slow down the development and deployment of AI technologies, particularly in smaller companies that may not have the resources to compete with tech giants like Google and Microsoft for talent. Despite these challenges, the overall outlook for the AI industry remains highly positive. The continuous advancements in AI technologies, coupled with their increasing integration into various sectors, provide a strong foundation for future growth.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

This translates into earnings as well. The consensus EPS estimate for 2025 and 2026 forecasts EPS growth of close to 15% for Meta Platforms.\nThis AI monetization by Meta Platforms, Inc.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Financial Media.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other artificial intelligence stocks recommended by financial media.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has now become a technology that most people are increasingly familiar with. With AI seeping into almost every aspect of life, from the ads you see on social media apps to the autonomous driving cars many consumers are shifting to. It's not an overstatement to say that AI has become part and parcel of everyday life for every person using technology today. Considering the widespread use and application of AI technology, this area of the market has become an exciting area to invest in today.\nWith the recent big tech companies' earnings being released, many investors are wondering what role AI is playing in the tech markets today, and how it will develop. On August 2, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi joined CNBC's \"The Exchange\" to discuss this very development. Here are some of his comments:\n\"I think what's happening is two things. On the one hand, it's macroeconomy, which has been sort of turbulent for a long period of time, and it seems to be now coming to an end, where we see it on the job market and people are seeing it on inflation and the 10-year coming down and so on. On the other hand, we see AI. People are very excited, they know it's gonna absolutely change the whole world, and that huge investments have been done by the hyperscalers in AI. But for us as a company, we've been investing in data and AI for the 10 years, and you know we see a steady growth revenue and customers getting value out of it, but theres been a huge deployment of capital... I think AI is gonna be amazing, it's gonna keep providing value.\"\nGhodsi's comments clarify the market's current opinion on AI, namely that this is an area of tech that cannot be ignored and must be invested in to the maximum. However, in light of such a market opinion, many investors may be beginning to wonder whether the huge amounts of investments being made in AI are justified or whether we are merely in what some may call an \"AI bubble\" that is definitely going to burst. Considering the immense value to be found in AI, though, many investors believe that such huge deployments of capital are, in fact, justified.\nConsidering the above, it's unsurprising that several big tech companies are part of the rat race to invest in and develop AI technologies. However, one notable absence in most lists of the best AI stocks to buy that are being made by financial media reporters is that of Apple. Many investors are beginning to take note of the fact that it is lagging behind other big tech companies that are rapidly developing AI tech. On August 6, Lightshed Partners' Walter Piecyk's shared his view on the smartphone maker's AI moves on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\".\n\"I signed up as a developer for the latest development or the latest release of iOS 18. I've been using the intelligent series - not that much better... There's a lot of work that's obviously gonna be done between now and when this is formally released. I just don't see it, for this year and for next year having some a big impact.\"\nInvestors may be better served by shifting to purer AI plays. For this reason, we have compiled a list of the best AI stocks to buy according to financial media, to offer insights into what companies are actually doing well in the AI space today. Our list includes some of the\u00a0best AI stocks to buy, according to analysts,\u00a0and some of the\u00a0companies offering the top AI SEO tools in 2024 as well.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nWe selected AI stocks that made the top AI stocks lists of various financial news reporters, such as Forbes, Motley Fool, Nasdaq, US News, and NerdWallet.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nMeta Platforms (META) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this social media company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 18%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 42.8% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 27.3%.\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.67, which means that the company gets $0.67 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.59, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Meta Platforms looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 19.6% this year versus the industry average of 7.2%.\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5.4% over the past month.\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Meta Platforms a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination positions Meta Platforms well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (META) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this social media company have returned +11.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has gained 8.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.14 per share, indicating a change of +17.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.5% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $21.30 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +43.2%. This estimate has changed +5.3% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.07 indicates a change of +13% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.8%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $40.08 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +17.4%. The $161.62 billion and $184.01 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +19.8% and +13.9%, respectively.\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $39.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.91%. The EPS surprise was +9.79%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms.

(META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nGrowth investors have been piling into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past few months as a variety of factors, including rapid technological advancements, soaring investment, and widespread adoption across sectors drive interest towards the AI business. Some important metrics illustrate this phenomenon. The global AI market was valued at approximately $142.3 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over 36%, reaching nearly $2 trillion by 2030. In 2024 alone, the AI market is expected to expand by around 40%, a pace that far outstrips the broader technology sector and the overall global economy, which is predicted to grow at a more modest 2.7%.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThis explosive growth is driven by the increasing integration of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing. Investment in AI is surging, with companies recognizing its potential to revolutionize business operations and deliver significant returns. According to PwC, AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, with North America and China accounting for nearly 70% of this value. In 2024, corporate investment in AI is expected to surpass $500 billion, driven by companies seeking to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate their product offerings.\nIndustry experts are increasingly bullish on the long-term prospects for AI stocks. According to a survey by Gartner, 80% of executives believe that AI will be a critical business driver by 2025, with 75% already piloting or implementing AI solutions. McKinsey estimates that AI could deliver up to $6.1 trillion in annual value across industries, primarily through automation and optimization. This growing confidence in AI capabilities is reflected in the stock market, where AI-focused companies have consistently outperformed their peers. For instance, AI-driven companies have seen their stock prices surge by over 50% in 2023 alone, a trend expected to continue as demand for AI solutions grows.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nThese AI-focused firms are also investing in AI startups as they seek to diversify their businesses. NVIDIA, Apple, and Microsoft are all reportedly considering a huge investment in OpenAI, a California-based AI firms whose claim to fame is the launch of ChatGPT back in late 2022. If the rumors are true, the latest round of funding would take the valuation of the startup to $100 billion. For some additional context, this value is higher than the combined GDPs of 110 nations, the highest for any venture capital backed firm in the US since Facebook's IPO, and the most valuable private firm in the US after Musk-owned SpaceX.\nThis high valuation also follows an emerging trend in the startup universe. Research into the domain by Coatue Management reveals that up until June 2024 year-to-date, there were a total of 200 AI-related deals in the venture capital world, compared to just 7,000 for non-AI firms. The average valuation in these deals for AI startups was around $1 billion. On the non-AI side, this value was only $200 million. The average funding round for AI firms fetched over $120 million, while this figure for non-AI companies was around $20 million. The numbers highlight that AI firms, on average, are valued at five times more than their non-AI peers and raise six times more in funding.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

(NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The company has taken a somewhat different approach to AI than the other tech giants. While the large language models (LLMs) of other AI firms are closed, Meta has decided to open source Llama, the LLM it has developed over the past few years. Companies and businesses can develop their own AI supermodels, tailored to their specific needs, around Llama.\nThis Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) strategy is already starting to bear fruit. Major companies have already started making their own AI models with Llama as a base. For example, professional services firm Accenture utilized Llama 3.1 to build a custom large language model to produce an annual ESG report. Telecom firm AT&T is using Llama and generative AI for customer service.\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Hottest 10 Stock Picks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Jim Cramer's other stock picks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer talked about what he sees as Wall Street's biggest oversights this earnings season, especially on a day when the Dow dropped 141 points, and the NASDAQ advanced 0.2%. Cramer highlighted the misleading narratives surrounding the impact of GLP-1 drugs on food and beverage companies, the reluctance to lower prices post-pandemic, the skepticism around AI investments, and the persistent belief that\nIntel remains dominant in the tech sector.\nCramer argues that if companies were more honest about their changing situations, they would gain credibility and potentially boost their stock prices. Instead, by withholding important details, they leave investors confused and more likely to make poor decisions.\n\"If companies just own up to their own changing circumstances, things would be so much easier for everybody. But who wants to admit mistakes? They earn a lot of credibility for themselves leading the higher stock prices down the line, instead their stocks languish as investors try to assess what's really going on and they presume the worst not the best.\" said Cramer.\nIn a time filled with so much misinformation, Cramer emphasized how easy it is to be misled and underscored the need to recognize these gaps. According to Cramer, despite approximately 20 million Americans reportedly using GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs, food and beverage companies refuse to acknowledge any negative impact of these medications. They won\u2019t even suggest it. Cramer argues that their denial of the effects of GLP-1 drugs is simply untrue.\n\"We know that people eat much less when they take these GLP-1s and consume less snack food because it tamps down on cravings. ...These drugs are incredibly powerful. The idea they aren't doing damage to the snack food companies is insane.\"\nCramer commented on the rising prices, stating that most companies see no need to lower them, despite significant hikes during the pandemic. He pointed out that airlines, which have consistently underperformed, refuse to reduce fares, behaving as if the price hikes never happened.\n\"In the airlines, there are endless underperformers, they simply wouldn't roll back prices, they act as if they didn't even take them up in the first place.\"\nThe same goes for hotels and entertainment venues, which sharply increased prices during the pandemic and now resist lowering them, even as demand forecasts decline. Cramer also noted that many restaurants either claim their price hikes haven't hurt sales or refuse to acknowledge the need to roll back prices.\n\"They raised prices drastically during the pandemic. They won't cap the raising prices too much even as the forecast is coming down hard.\"\nDiscussing AI, Cramer strongly disagrees with Wall Street's claim that AI investments are a waste of money. He points out that many believe big companies spending heavily on AI-related video chips aren't seeing any significant returns, and are only investing to keep up with competitors (see 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\n\"We're constantly being told that none of the big companies spending a fortune in video chips for AI has seen any meaningful return on that investment. They're only doing it to prevent their competitors from getting an edge. That's what we keep on hearing. That's absurd!\"\nCramer also challenged the common belief that INTC remains a leader in its sector. He dismissed claims that the company is poised for a major comeback, particularly in data centers, and that it has a chip capable of rivaling its competitors' dominance. He pointed out that the company's financial health tells a different story, citing the company's decision to cut its dividend last year and suspend the remainder this year. According to Cramer, these actions don't signal dominance, and he warned that this is not the same semiconductor company it once was, despite what the company might claim.\n\"I keep hearing that Intel's gonna make a huge comeback that is catching up the others in the data center. That the data center has an Nvidia killer in GE-3. That it's using the chips to sack money from you and further it's dominance. Dream on! Have you seen Intel's balance sheet? Can you read one? Do you think a company that cut its dividend last year and then suspends what was left of it this year in order to assert its dominance?! Look, this is not the Intel of old even though we want it to be. Despite Intel's protestations, I wouldn't want to be Intel's partner.\"\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors:246\nJim Cramer points out that skeptics should take notice of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s recent achievements with their computing power. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has rapidly emerged as a leading generative AI platform with Meta AI, which Cramer himself has switched to because of its impressive performance.\n\"Memo to the clueless naysaying individuals: Have you seen what Meta Platforms has been doing with their computing power? They have, out of nowhere, become one of the most popular generative AI platforms with Meta AI. You have to try. I have switched to it. It is that good. Meta has been using their Nvidia purchases to make instagram reels much more relevant to you, much faster, cleaner. Meta has the best numbers of any of the tech titans. You think that's some sort of coincidence?\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is experiencing impressive financial growth, highlighted by a 22% year-over-year revenue increase and a 73% surge in net income for Q2 2024. This growth is driven by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s disciplined cost management and its substantial investments in AI infrastructure. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is planning capital expenditures between $37 billion and $40 billion this year, including the purchase of 350,000 Nvidia GPUs to strengthen its AI capabilities.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s open-source AI model, Llama 3.1, is particularly noteworthy for its cost efficiency and its ability to drive faster innovation through collaboration. As digital advertising spending continues to increase, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s platforms, such as Instagram and Facebook, are expected to retain their dominant positions, further boosting the company's growth outlook.\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nOne of the biggest breakthroughs of artificial intelligence in the past few years has been the advances in natural language processing. These AI models in language are now making their way into the business world and the society at large. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Expert economists Joseph Briggs and Devesh Kodnani recently wrote in a report that the ability of AI tools to generate content that is indistinguishable from human-created output and to break down communication barriers between humans and machines reflects a major advancement with potentially large macroeconomic effects.\nSome of these macro factors are more discernible in the form of numbers. A recent study on artificial intelligence by Stanford University in the United States reveals that businesses are already outpacing academics when it comes to training AI models. For example, in 2023, the AI industry was able to train nearly 51 notable machine learning models (read more about these firms by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To) compared to just 15 for academia. This happened despite the costs associated with training models rising. For instance, ChatGPT 4, the latest iteration of the popular ChatGPT that launched the AI wave back in late 2022, cost nearly $80 million to train. Similarly, Gemini Ultra, an AI tool developed by Google, cost $191 million to compute. The number of AI patents is also increasing, evidenced by the fact that since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.\nThis exciting phase in the world of technology has ushered in a new boom for the world economy, previously plagued by inflation concerns, geopolitical conflicts, and stagnating demand figures. The bullish sentiment on AI needs to be balanced with caution. In the long run, investors should prepare themselves for significant changes to how the world works as AI could automate nearly 300 million jobs. In previous cycles of automation, new jobs and opportunities have risen to replace this. Recognizing these opportunities (read more about them by accessing 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave) ahead of the time could go a long way towards balancing the risk profiles of growth-heavy portfolios. Recent research suggests that 60% of the workforce presently was occupied in positions that did not exist just half a century ago, lending credence to claims that over 80% of employment growth since the time can be explained by tech-driven innovation.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

The firm projects 2024 capital expenditures coming in at $37 billion to $40 billion, up from previous estimates of $35 billion to $40 billion. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors recently that Meta AI was on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.\nAnalysts at investment advisory Barclays believe that investors are mis-modeling the hidden costs of AI spend to around 5% of the EPS. However, the advisory maintained an Overweight rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock with a price target of $520, underlining that even though the present outlook on AI was bullish, the risks associated with higher capex on AI would not be fully realized before the latter part of 2025 and early 2026.\nOverall META ranks 4th on our of the trending AI stocks according to latest news and analyst ratings.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AdTech stocks.\nIt goes without saying that the advertisement technology industry happens to be an exciting and ever-evolving sector, as digital advertising continues to dominate the market trends and remains at the forefront when it comes to strategic marketing. According to industry data by Allied Market Research, the global AdTech market was pegged at $748.2 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach $2.9 trillion by 2031. This demonstrates a CAGR of ~14.7% from 2022 to 2031.\nThis growth comes off the back of growing digital and internet penetration, increased usage of advanced technology like AI and machine learning, improved prospects for the gaming industry, and growth in social media apps including Facebook, WhatsApp, and others. Some of the top trends dominating the AdTech industry include higher usage of connected TV (CTV) advertising, in-app advertising, and interactive ads.\nThe AdTech market has been bifurcated into solution, advertising type, size of an enterprise, platform, etc. The AdTech industry includes a wide range of companies and products, such as demand-side platforms (DSPs), supply-side platforms (SSPs), ad exchanges, data management platforms (DMPs), and more. Experts are of the view that the global supply-side platform (SSP) market size should touch ~$117.32 billion by 2033. This means that the industry should compound at ~13.3% from 2023 to 2033. This growth is expected to stem from technological advancements, higher consumer demand, and supportive government policies.\nIn the same vein, the demand side platform software market size should touch US$120.1 billion by 2033 on the heels of an improved trend of programmatic advertising and, the need for better targeting along with measurement capabilities for online ads. While the AdTech industry seems promising, inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI) makes it even more appealing.\nGlobal AdTech industry continues to prepare for the complete deprecation of third-party cookies by Google, which makes up ~65% of the web browser market share. This transition seems to be a critical step for enabling user privacy and data security. Artificial Intelligence, because of its capability to process vast amounts of data, should play a crucial role.\nResearch suggests that ~54% of businesses believe that AI offers advertising cost savings and efficiencies and ~30% of marketing professionals decided to earmark more than 40% of their marketing budget to campaigns that are AI-executed. The advent of smart speakers, voice search, and podcasting can help advertisers in creating fresh avenues to connect with target audiences with the help of audio and voice technology.\nWhile advertisers can exploit the opportunities available in the AdTech industry, they need to be wary about challenges such as Ad fraud. These frauds are caused mainly because of bot traffic, domain spoofing, or ad stacking. Some other challenges include inventory quality, ad creativity, and brand safety.\nAI and ML are revolutionizing digital advertising by enabling advertisers to assess vast amounts of data in real time. As a result, the advertisers can make data-driven decisions for optimizing ad campaigns. Advertisers now use algorithmic advertising, personalization, and performance metrics to maximize ROI.\nAI algorithms help in automating media buying, making sure that ads reach the target audience. Personalized ads can be delivered using AI-powered recommendation engines and these engines enable real-time tracking, which can help make quick adjustments to fuel success.\nThe global AdTech industry is expected to compound in the mid-teens range over the next decade. Given that it's still early in its growth story, now is the time to look at some of the best AdTech stocks.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the holdings of SmartETFs Advertising & Marketing Technology ETF and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them.

Ads revenue saw a jump of ~22% YoY, and the management of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is quite optimistic about ads revenue for 3Q 2024.\nIn May, the company unveiled a slate\u00a0of new Gen-AI-powered tools and services. These services focus on helping businesses\u00a0improve their ad performance and visibility on the company\u2019s popular social platforms\u00a0such as Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0Instagram.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s management highlighted that spending is expected to significantly increase in 2025 because of its infrastructure costs. Well, this increase is understandable as this is related to the development of a leading large language model. This powers GenAI technologies.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Among The Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors",
        "Author": "  Fatima Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other American stocks.\nHistorically, September is considered to be the worst month for stocks. The S&P 500 index has generally averaged a decline in the month of September for decades, which has resulted in many financial news reporters, such as the Wall Street Journal, dubbing September as a weak month for US stocks. So with August coming to an end, many investors in the US and abroad may be wondering whether now is a good time to pick up US stocks for their portfolios.\nWhile history can often be an accurate indicator of stock performance, this is not always the case. This year may very well be an outlier in the historical trend outlined above, seeing as many financial analysts are expecting the US Federal Reserve to move ahead with a rate cut this September. CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on August 21 highlighted that according to the Fed's recent meeting minutes, it is quite probable that we will be seeing a rate cut this September, which will probably result in stock prices rising and the markets performing better. This is because when a rate cut is announced, consumers and businesses tend to increase their spending and investment, which has a direct and positive impact on stock prices, causing them to rise. As such, if we do see a rate cut next month, investors may actually benefit from investing in American stocks.\nOn August 22, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss the status of the US markets at present. Here's what he had to say:\n\"The FMOC minutes that came out yesterday showed the Fed staff saying this is a strong labor market, while that jobs report that came out Friday and the revisions that just came out show a lot of jobs disappearing. It's not a stronger market, and I think it gives more ammunition for the Fed to start a cutting cycle, and that's gonna give a lot of life to the economy and to the markets. Especially cyclical stocks and small-cap stocks.\"\nAccording to Lee, investors looking to buy into US equities right now would benefit greatly from a rate cut if it does come about in September. A major beneficiary of such a cut would actually be the tech sector. In this regard, Lee said the following:\n\"I think tech is still in a good place because of AI, and NVIDIA should reinforce that. It's not a demanding multiple, maybe 28x forward earnings, which is, for the best, one of the most important companies in the world, not a high multiple. So, if tech is in a good place, and then we get fed cuts, I think it allows the whole overall market to expand.\"\nConsidering the above, US markets may actually be a good place to invest for foreign investors at present, and within these markets, tech may be a good place to start. This is why we've compiled a list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors, comprising most tech companies. Our list includes some of the best American tech stocks to buy, alongside some of the top US stocks for foreigners.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nWe selected the most popular American stocks among major hedge funds to compile our list, by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter of 2024. These companies are considered to be the best US stocks to invest in today according to major institutional investors, and should thus be considered by foreign investors looking to buy into American equities.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a major company in the communications sector since it operates the world's largest social network. The main revenue growth driver for the company is online advertising, which Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does exceptionally well through its numerous social media platforms.\nWith the rise of AI and advertisement demand, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has only made its business model and growth more robust. The company's revenue grew by 22% year-over-year in the second quarter, because of these factors. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also gaining a lot of popularity because of its immense contributions to generative AI development, with the company calculated to have ramped up spending on this development to over $20 billion annually.\nThere were 219 hedge funds long Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $42.5 billion.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Let's talk about the popular Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let\u2019s examine Meta Platforms\u2019s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there\u2019s still a bargain opportunity.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nAccording to our valuation model, Meta Platforms seems to be fairly priced at around 18% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Meta Platforms today, you\u2019d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company\u2019s true value is $641.78, then there\u2019s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Meta Platforms\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Meta Platforms' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 44%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? META\u2019s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on META, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nIf you'd like to know more about Meta Platforms as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms you should know about.\nIf you are no longer interested in Meta Platforms, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Wall Street Analysts Think Meta Platforms (META) Is a Good Investment: Is It?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Meta Platforms (META).\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.33, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.33 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 39 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 86.7% and 2.2% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>While the ABR calls for buying Meta Platforms, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 5.4% over the past month to $21.23.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Meta Platforms may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Advertising Stocks to Buy According to Short Sellers.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other advertising stocks.\nWhen compared to the copy driven model of the late 1900s as popularized by shows such as Mad Men, the advertising era of 2024 is completely different. Today, advertisers have at their disposal the data of billions of people which they can characterize according to preference and target their ads to. This growth in digital advertising has been driven by the rise of video streaming platforms and digital publications, which continue to gain market share over paper newspapers.\nNowhere else is the impact of digital advertising in today's era clear as through the value of the world's largest search engine company. A mega cap stock, this firm has a market value of a whopping $2 trillion, making it one of the largest companies in the world in terms of market value. Yet, in another case of 2024 being a historic year of shifts for the technology industry as evidenced by technologies such as artificial intelligence, this firm is also facing the heat from the US government which might end up changing the very fabric of the industry.\nThe search engine giant, which earned $187 billion in trailing twelve month revenue from search and advertising, traces its roots back to the late 1990s when its founders created an algorithm called PageRank. This software determined which webpages were authoritative based on the amount and quality of backlinks they got, and as the engine grew, so did the firm's dominance in the global advertising industry as it processes more than 22 billion searches per day. However, this gravy train might be ending as a Washington judge ruled in August that its $26 billion in payments to other firms to make the platform the default option on their devices was an anti competitive behavior that locked others out in the industry.\nFollowing the ruling, there are rumors that the Justice Department might be considering breaking the company up by making it divest its mobile software and web browsing business divisions. However, any such decision will require court approval which will force the firm to comply. And while a court victory is great for news headlines, the US government has rarely broken up large companies in the modern era. The last such case was in 1982 through the breakup of the Bell System, and even if the browser and OS were made separate businesses, they are unlikely to survive on their own since both are provided to users for free.\nNot to mention, the long drawn nature of anti-trust action could take years, and end up being enforced when the industry is vastly different from what it is now. This is because artificial intelligence is gnawing at the heels of the industry, with products such as OpenAI's SearchGPT already in early stage releases. Speaking of AI, it's also making its mark on the advertising industry. Just as advertisers are able to rely on millions of users' data through search and social media platforms, AI helps them navigate through this data in novel and new ways.\nAs per McKinsey, marketing and sales could see a $931 billion productivity boost from AI through new features such as personalized campaigns and improved data use. These use cases have already become apparent, with the largest social media company in the world regularly sharing updates about how it is using AI to make advertisers' jobs easier on its platform. Two tools that it offers are the Advantage+ and Advantage+ Shopping platform which enables advertisers and sellers to automate their campaign operations and determine the best advertisements to run. The platforms also appear to be driving results, with the firm quoting a study that is \"demonstrating 22% higher return on ad spend for US advertisers after they adopted Advantage+ Shopping campaigns\" with revenue for the firm through the two AI platforms doubling annually during Q1 2024.\nSpeaking of revenue, the advertising industry's spending, which determines the fate of publishers is also determined by the state of the economy, consumer confidence, and advertisers' outlook. One such firm with brands in more than 100 companies shared during its Q2 2024 earnings call that while the advertising market is not at its best right now, it does appear to be recovering. This recovery is taking place in areas such as food and technology which joins strong performance in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and beauty care. Another publisher, which is one of the most well known digital media and lifestyle platforms in the world that relies on programmatic advertising (data driven user targeting through ads), saw its programmatic revenue grow by 3% annually during Q2 even as broader advertising revenue dropped by 19% annually.\nWith these details in mind let's take a look at which advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers. For stocks that are driving advertising technology, you should check out 8 Best AdTech Stocks to Buy Now.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the best advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers, we listed the NASDAQ and NYSE listings of an advertising ETF by the percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short and selected the stocks with the lowest percentage. An added 23 stocks after an internet search were also analyzed, but all these had market caps below $300 million so they were excluded.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nShort Interest as % of\u00a0 Shares Outstanding: 1.1%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. It is also the social media firm mentioned in our introduction, and its user base of roughly 3.79 billion people means that without Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the advertising industry significantly shrinks. The firm offers a variety of products to two kinds of advertisers on its platform. These cater to advertising firms that are running campaigns for big businesses and small and medium businesses that rely on platforms such as the Facebook Marketplace. In the fiercely competitive AI race among big tech, a large chunk of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s hypothesis depends on its ability to monetize AI and use the technologies to improve user experience and create new products for advertisers. This is in addition to the firm's ability to retain social media users amidst trend shifts among Gen Z.\nPolen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\"Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company's \"year of efficiency,\" where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\"\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the best advertising stocks to buy according to short sellers. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe AI industry continues to be highly dynamic, with significant growth anticipated across various sectors in 2024. The expansion of generative AI, which saw exponential growth in 2023, is expected to continue this year, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value as businesses move from pilot projects to broader implementation. This shift suggests that 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI as companies aim to leverage capabilities more fully to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate across different industries. The market for generative AI is forecasted to grow rapidly, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 60%, reaching a valuation of around $37 billion by 2028. This growth is fueled by the widespread adoption of AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and Billionaire Druckenmiller is Betting on AI\nThe AI revolution is already transforming operations across the world by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and enhancing predictive capabilities. The healthcare sector, for example, is poised for substantial advancements due to AI, with the market expected to grow to around $188 billion by 2030, driven by innovations in genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. Edge computing is another area likely to see significant development in 2024, as it becomes increasingly critical for enabling AI applications that require real-time data processing. The move towards edge computing, where data is processed closer to the source, is expected to reduce latency and improve the performance of AI systems, particularly in sectors like autonomous vehicles, IoT, and industrial automation.\nThis trend underscores the growing importance of a robust semiconductor supply chain, especially as global trade tensions and geopolitical events continue to impact the availability of critical components like chips. Experts also emphasize the growing importance of ethical considerations and responsible AI. As AI technologies become more deeply embedded in various aspects of society, concerns around privacy, bias, and security are likely to intensify, prompting calls for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. The rapid growth will also bring challenges related to talent acquisition, supply chain management, and the need for responsible AI practices.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "With its stock down 12% over the past month, it is easy to disregard Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Meta Platforms'  ROE.\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nThe formula for return on equity is:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Meta Platforms is:\n33% = US$51b \u00f7 US$157b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.33 in profit.\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\nTo begin with, Meta Platforms has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 7.4% the company's ROE is quite impressive. This likely paved the way for the modest 13% net income growth seen by Meta Platforms over the past five years.\nWe then compared Meta Platforms' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 4.7% in the same 5-year period.\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is META fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\nIn Meta Platforms' case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 3.9% (or a retention ratio of 96%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.\nWhile Meta Platforms has seen growth in its earnings, it only recently started to pay a dividend. It is most likely that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 9.2% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 22%) over the same period.\nIn total, we are pretty happy with Meta Platforms' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

Munster, however, thinks AI spending is necessary for these companies to reap rewards in the future. Munster referred to a latest interview of Mark Zuckerberg in which he said if his company does not keep spending on AI it may miss the biggest opportunity in the next 10-15 years. Munster said Zuckerberg believes this AI spending \u201ccannot slow down.\u201d\n\u201cI am most optimistic because that CapEX number, if you\u2019re gonna boil it down to one point, it\u2019s gonna be higher for longer and it\u2019s good for AI.\u201d\nAsked whether investors should stick with mega-cap AI stocks or move on to smaller companies that could benefit from this AI spending, Munster said that depends on to what degree you believe in the transformative power of AI.\n\u201cIf you are in my camp.. which I think it (AI) will be more transformative than the internet, then small companies and the big companies are going to participate.\u201d\nMunster thinks the AI-led bull market could last for 3-5 years before ending in what he called a \u201cspectacular bubble burst.\u201d\nFor this article, we picked the AI stocks Gene Munster and his firm Deepwater Asset Management hold, according to the disclosures on CNBC.

        "Text": "In November 2022, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) stock bottomed at around $90 following a 76% plunge from its all-time high. Investors felt the company was neglecting its core social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram, in favor of spending billions of dollars on projects like the metaverse, which generated minimal revenue. That strategy placed significant pressure on Meta's profitability.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg decided to make some drastic changes. By mid 2023, he had cut over 21,000 jobs, committed to spending more cautiously on the metaverse, and invested heavily in artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance Facebook and Instagram, which is already paying off with increased engagement (which leads to more advertising revenue).\nMeta's reduced workforce and streamlined cost structure drove a surge in its profitability. In the recent second quarter of 2024 (ended June 30), Meta's net income grew by 73% from the year-ago period, and that followed a more than doubling in net income during each of the previous three quarters:\nMeta's improved profitability sent its stock tearing higher by 464% from its November 2022 low point, to trade at over $508 as of this writing. But it's probably not done.\nThe company's net income over the last four quarters translated into $19.59 in earnings per share, placing its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.9. That's a 16% discount to the 30.9 P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100 index, implying Meta stock is still undervalued relative to its big-tech peers.\nWhile Meta is developing AI like most tech giants, this is a good reminder that stock price performance is often driven by a company's earnings power, rather than the latest hot trend.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

Profits were up 73% from a year ago.\nIts app family (Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp) also walloped expectations with revenues of $38.72 billion. Sales for the app family rose about $7 billion year over year.\nMeta stock has rallied 7.5% since the company's Aug. 1 earnings report, according to Yahoo Finance data. Shares are still off by 4% in the past month as sentiment has soured on the Magnificent Seven name.\nThe Magnificent Seven includes Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Meta.\nUnlike Meta, the other six names have dealt with various negative news in recent weeks that have pressured their shares.\nNvidia is reportedly delaying the shipment of its new Blackwell AI chips by a quarter. Tesla had a terrible second quarter. Alphabet preached of needing more time for AI adoption, while market leader Microsoft's AI results didn't live up to expectations. Amazon warned of a slowing consumer in its second quarter.\nAll of the non-Meta Magnificent Seven stocks are down since Meta's earnings report, led by a 13% drop in Tesla stock.\nThen there is Apple.\nBlain, who had been bullish on Apple, has recently shifted perspective.\n\u201cWhen Warren Buffett turned around and dumped the stock, I thought, he must know something I don\u2019t,\u201d said Blain.\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) reportedly slashed its stake in the tech giant by as much as 50%.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms' estimated fair value is US$642 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nMeta Platforms' US$529 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate\nOur fair value estimate is 13% higher than Meta Platforms' analyst price target of US$567\nHow far off is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$53.0b\nUS$58.2b\nUS$62.0b\nUS$70.5b\nUS$75.6b\nUS$80.0b\nUS$83.8b\nUS$87.3b\nUS$90.5b\nUS$93.4b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x15\nAnalyst x8\nAnalyst x2\nAnalyst x2\nEst @ 7.23%\nEst @ 5.81%\nEst @ 4.82%\nEst @ 4.12%\nEst @ 3.63%\nEst @ 3.29%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% \nUS$49.5k\nUS$50.9k\nUS$50.7k\nUS$53.9k\nUS$54.1k\nUS$53.5k\nUS$52.5k\nUS$51.1k\nUS$49.5k\nUS$47.9k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$514b\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.5%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$93b\u00d7 (1 + 2.5%) \u00f7 (6.9%\u2013 2.5%) = US$2.2t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$2.2t\u00f7 ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$1.1t\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$1.6t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$529, the company appears about fair value at a 18% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Meta Platforms as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.073. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Meta Platforms, we've compiled three essential items you should explore:\nRisks: Be aware that  Meta Platforms is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...\nManagement:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for META's future outlook?

While talking to CNBC in a latest program, Michael Landsberg of Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth said that the latest decline is a \u201clittle bit of a reset, obviously.\u201d The analyst said that AI stocks had a \u201cgreat run\u201d and the latest pullback is a \u201ctypical process\u201d of market rotation.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we are not positive longer term on AI but when you have big runs like that that\u2019s why you rebalance portfolios to keep the risk in check,\u201d Landsberg said.\nAsked if the AI bubble has popped and this is the end of the AI hype, the analyst said \u201cabsolutely not\u201d and called the recent pullback \u201cdeceleration\u201d from growth and \u201cnormalization.\u201d\nLandsberg said that the earnings season will \u201cseparate the wheat from the chaff\u201d and believes major tech companies will still drive earnings in the future.\nFor this article, we scanned the latest AI news, earnings, and analyst ratings and picked the 10 biggest stocks moving on these developments. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it\u2019s doing would bear more results in the future. After the results, Citi said it remains \u201cincrementally positive\u201d on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares due to engagement and monetization gains, along with expanding margins. The firm raised its price target for META to $580 from $550.\nJPMorgan said it sees AI benefiting Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) at three levels: core Family of Apps (FoA) improvements, new opportunities and experiences, and scaling the Metaverse. It also upped META price target to $610 from $480.\nMorgan Stanley also liked how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is improving its recommendation systems and quality with AI.\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company\u2019s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it\u2019s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year\u2019s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year\u2019s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot,\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Top 10 Latest AI News, Earnings and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.

        "Title": "Decoding Meta Platforms Inc (META): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Robust revenue growth and operational efficiency underscore Meta's market leadership.\nInvestments in R&D and strategic positioning for future growth opportunities.\nChallenges in maintaining user engagement and navigating regulatory landscapes.\nCompetitive threats and market dynamics present ongoing risks.\nOn August 1, 2024, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) filed its 10-Q report, revealing a company at the forefront of social networking with a vast user base and a dominant position in digital advertising. This SWOT analysis delves into the intricacies of Meta's financials and strategic positioning, providing investors with a comprehensive view of the company's potential. The latest filing shows a significant increase in revenue, from $31,999 million in the first half of 2023 to $39,071 million in the same period in 2024, marking a robust growth trajectory. Net income also saw a substantial rise, from $7,788 million to $13,465 million year-over-year for the quarter ended June 30. These figures reflect Meta's strong market presence and operational efficiency.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with META.\nFinancial Performance and Market Position: Meta Platforms Inc's financial health is a testament to its strengths. The company's revenue surged to $39,071 million in the three months ended June 30, 2024, up from $31,999 million in the prior year. This impressive growth is supported by a net income increase to $13,465 million, nearly doubling from the previous year's $7,788 million. Such financial prowess is indicative of Meta's solid market position and its ability to monetize its extensive user base effectively.\nResearch and Development Prowess: Meta's commitment to innovation is evident in its R&D investments, which stood at $10,537 million for the quarter, reflecting the company's focus on sustaining long-term growth through technological advancements. This investment fuels the development of new products and features, ensuring Meta remains at the cutting edge of the social media and digital advertising industries.\nDependence on Advertising Revenue: Despite its financial strength, Meta's heavy reliance on advertising revenue, which constitutes over 90% of its total revenue, poses a risk. This dependence makes Meta vulnerable to fluctuations in advertising demand and changes in the digital advertising landscape, such as privacy regulations and ad-blocking technologies.\nOperational Costs: The company's operational costs, including a significant outlay for R&D, marketing, sales, and general administrative expenses, have risen to $24,224 million. These costs reflect the investments needed to maintain its competitive edge but also pressure profit margins and could impact long-term profitability if not managed effectively.\nExpansion into Emerging Markets: With over 45% of revenue coming from the US and Canada, Meta has significant opportunities to expand its global footprint, particularly in emerging markets. These regions offer a growing user base and increasing digital ad spend, which Meta can capitalize on to diversify its revenue streams and reduce geographic concentration risk.\nAdvancements in Technology: Meta's ongoing investments in R&D position the company to leverage emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality. These advancements present opportunities to enhance user experience, create new revenue models, and maintain a technological lead over competitors.\nRegulatory Challenges: Meta faces potential threats from increasing regulatory scrutiny, particularly concerning data privacy and content moderation. Compliance with diverse and evolving regulations can lead to increased operational costs and constraints on business practices, impacting Meta's agility and growth prospects.\nIntense Competition: The social media and digital advertising spaces are highly competitive, with players like Google and Apple integrating competing products into their ecosystems. Such competition could erode Meta's user base and ad revenue, necessitating continuous innovation and strategic initiatives to stay ahead.\nIn conclusion, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) exhibits a strong financial foundation and a commitment to innovation that positions it well for future growth. However, its reliance on advertising revenue and the high operational costs associated with maintaining its market position are areas that require careful management. Opportunities for expansion and technological advancements present pathways for Meta to diversify and strengthen its business model. Nevertheless, the company must navigate regulatory challenges and fierce competition to maintain its status as a leader in the digital landscape. The strategic initiatives Meta undertakes in response to these SWOT elements will be critical in shaping its trajectory in the dynamic tech industry.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Except for NVIDIA, it has outperformed the rest of Magnificent 7 over the same time frame.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta Platforms has been leveraging AI and machine learning to boost the potency of its social-media offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Threads. It has been improving the quality of recommendations to drive engagement.\u00a0Meta Platforms is leveraging AI to boost Facebook\u2019s appeal among young adults (18\u201329-year-olds), a demography that used to prefer Alphabet\u2019s YouTube and Snapchat.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Meta (META) shares soared more than 9% in early trading Thursday after the company reported better-than-expected second quarter earnings results Wednesday, and despite warning it expects to see \"significant\" capital expenditures growth in 2025.\n\"While we do not intend to provide any quantitative guidance for 2025 until the fourth quarter call, we expect infrastructure costs will be a significant driver of expense growth next year as we recognize depreciation and operating costs associated with our expanded infrastructure footprint,\" CFO Susan Li said in a statement.\nAI spending is a key measure for Wall Street as investors anxiously await a return on Big Tech\u2019s investments in the technology. During its prior quarter, Li raised the company\u2019s full-year total expense estimate from between $94 billion and $99 billion to between $96 billion and $99 billion.\nFor the second quarter, Meta saw earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 on revenue of $39.07 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $4.74 on revenue of $38.3 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Meta recorded EPS of $2.98 on revenue of $31.9 billion during the same period last year.\nThe company\u2019s Family of Apps revenue, which includes revenue from Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, clocked in at $38.72 billion, higher than estimates of $37.7 billion. Meta saw revenue of $31.7 billion in the segment in Q2 last year.\nBeyond its advertising revenue, Wall Street is still trying to determine how much longer Meta will need to plow money into AI before it sees some kind of revenue payoff.\nLast week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta\u2019s latest open-source large language model (LLM) called Llama 3.1. What\u2019s more, the Facebook founder said the industry should focus on open-source AI rather than closed-source models like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\"Meta is well positioned to drive value with [generative AI] for advertisers, but let\u2019s be clear that it\u2019s a ways off, if ever, before CMOs will simply hand over the keys to an AI agent that will autonomously generate ad creative on their behalf,\" Forrester research director Mike Proulx said in a note following Meta's earnings.\n\"While [generative AI's] technical capabilities meaningfully mature at an accelerated pace, Meta cannot lose sight of the responsibility and importance of the human touch in the advertising process.\u201d\nMeta\u2019s Reality Labs segment, which includes its mixed reality hardware and software, saw revenue of $353 million in the quarter versus expectations of $376 million. That's better than the company reported in the same quarter last year, but the segment continues to hemorrhage cash.\nIn Q2, Meta reported that the segment lost some $4.49 billion, slightly below expectations of $4.53 billion. It lost $3.8 billion in Q1. The division has also been plagued by turnover and a lack of clear vision, adding to Reality Labs\u2019 troubles, Yahoo Finance\u2019s Yasmin Khorram reported.\nMeta\u2019s announcement also comes after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced on Tuesday that he secured a $1.4 billion settlement between the state and Meta over the company\u2019s alleged use of Texans\u2019 biometric data without their permission for its Tag Suggestions feature.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Among Goldman Sachs\u2019 Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs' Best Hedge Fund Stock Picks: Top 20 Stocks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Goldman Sachs' other hedge fund stock picks.\nThe close of August has marked a highly awaited paradigm shift on Wall Street that investors have been wishing for months. This shift comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally admitted that the time for interest rate cuts had come. Investors rejoiced and the flagship S&P index gained 1.15% while the Dow's blue chip stock index added 1.14% to its value.\nBefore the Fed chair's remarks, investment bank Goldman Sachs had already taken a detailed look at the implications of interest rate cuts on the stock market. In a podcast, the bank's trading strategy head Josh Schiffrin started by explaining that the prospect of the Fed reducing rates was linked \"very closely to the performance of short-term bonds.\" He however added that it's \"really been bonds that have been responsive, where the story has been quite clear,\" pointing out that \"the stock market has been range bound and choppy with a fair amount of rotation between different sectors\" which leads to index level moves being \"muted.\" This makes sense when we consider the Dow and S&P's movements following Powell's latest comments, as the one percentage point gain for each indicated that investors were well prepared for rate cuts even before the Fed Chair took the stand.\nSpeaking of the flagship S&P index, GS' head of American Equity Sales Trading John Flood shared some insights at the June close. Starting off by highlighting the drives of the index's performance during the first half of the year, Flood outlined that when it came to hedge funds, artificial intelligence and GLP-1 were the two key trends that had driven index returns. He described it as \"a long momentum trade\" with \"both cohorts\" of the hedge fund side, namely the \"systemic and fundamental long-short\" fully involved in trading.\nThe Goldman equity head also added that retail investors were finally back as well, and they were focused on \"focused on the ten biggest stocks in the world.\" You can see which companies these might be by reading 20 Largest Companies in the World by Market Cap in 2024. One key concern among investors and analysts alike this year has been a bifurcation in market returns that has seen only the best performers yield most of the rewards. This was also on the mind of analysts from another well known Wall Street bank, who added that it created an opportunity for further profits. Flood shared that while five stocks accounted for \"60% of S&P 500's return year to date,\" this sharp divide did not make him uncomfortable.\nSEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley\nThe investor flood of optimism surrounding AI, which has pushed the shares of the top AI GPU designer in the world to post an unbelievable 321,150% in all time returns, has also led to worries that the market might be witnessing another period akin to the ill fated dotcom era of the 1990s. When asked whether this period reminded him of that time, Flood replied that his firm felt \"a little bit more like 1995 than 1999. And 1995 clearly was a very positive year for the stock market and a positive run,\" particularly since \"valuations and earnings from market leaders are way friendlier today than they were in 1999.\" Concluding by sharing that he felt \"very bullish\" the analyst also forecast his estimate for the flagship S&P. His estimate? Well, Flood believes that \"you could see S&P 500 trade well north of 6,000 this year as the biggest get bigger and we continue to just see a little bit of a news vacuum into the elections right now.\"\nThe bit about market bifurcation between big and small companies was also on the mind of GS' senior US portfolio strategist Ben Snider. He commented on the jump in small cap stocks in July when they gained as much as 2% while other indexes lost up to 1.98% due to investors positioning themselves for potential interest rate cuts. Snider explained that small cap stocks tend to take on more debt, and lower rates coupled with their lower market values lead to big gains. According to him \"if just 1% of assets comes out of the S&P 500 and flows into, for example, the Russell 2000 Small Cap Index, that 1% of S&P 500 market cap would represent more than 15% of Russell 2000 market cap.\" Coming back to AI, the Goldman strategist has a tip for those who might be worried that the hype surrounding AI might be more than the technology's ability to generate money for the firms that plan to plow a trillion dollars into it. He shared that as opposed to the market cap weighted benchmark S&P, it might be prudent to invest in the equal weight variant \"if you are concerned about the degree of concentration or AI investment.\"\nSpeaking of AI, GS was also out with a detailed report in July which analyzed the year to date returns of different AI sectors. The AI stack, broadly speaking, is made up of four categories of firms. Starting from the bottom of the pyramid and moving upwards, these are chip manufacturers and designers, those that provide AI capacity like server farms, firms that sell AI products, and finally, companies that will see the largest gains from the ubiquitous or near ubiquitous adaptation of AI. As per GS, the year to date returns of these four sectors as of late July were 139% (represented only by the top AI GPU stock), 22%, -2%, and 2% respectively. One of the strongest performers within the AI infrastructure segment is utilities, and there's further room ahead as analyst Ryan Hammond believes that \"after adjusting valuations for the improvement in long- term EPS growth expectations that the sector has experienced, Utilities\u2019 PEG (P/E to long term growth (LTG)) ratio is 2x, well below the historical average of 3x.\"\nSo, with GS taking a broad view of the market, we decided to see which hedge fund stocks the bank is a fan of.\nTo make our list of Goldman Sachs' top hedge fund stocks, we ranked the bank's list of stocks with the number of hedge funds that, according to its data, had the stock as a top ten holding.\nWe also mentioned the total number of hedge funds that had bought these stocks as per Insider Monkey's data. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, it enjoys a sizeable user base of more than 3.2 billion people as of March. This provides Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) a wide moat in the social media sector, as it only has to improve its services to ensure user retention instead of having to focus on growth like other companies. Additionally, the keys to its hypothesis are its ability to ensure that users spend more time on its platform and the ability to monetize this time spent. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) focuses on two broad based monetization strategies. The first is based on targeting its products like WhatsApp to business users and the second is using new technologies such as artificial intelligence to improve ad placement and drive up ad sales to advertisers. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also a key player in the AI race and has announced new features that it can monetize such as AI Studio which lets anyone on its platform create AI.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s management shared details for Meta Studio during the Q2 2024 earnings call:\n\"And this week we launched AI Studio, which lets anyone create AIs to interact with across our apps.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of Goldman Sachs' hedge fund stock picks.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\nShares of this social media company have returned +12.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has gained 1.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5.6%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $21.27 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +43%. This estimate has changed +5.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.03 indicates a change of +13% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Meta Platforms.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $40.08 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +17.4%. The $161.35 billion and $183.86 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +19.6% and +14%, respectively.\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $39.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.91%. The EPS surprise was +9.79%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. sold $10.5 billion of investment-grade bonds, its largest-ever debt sale, which will boost its cash pile as the company spends heavily on artificial intelligence.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nBiden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction\nHow Chicago\u2019s Gigantic Merchandise Mart Is Still Thriving as Office Space\nGottheimer Calls for Rail Riders to Be Reimbursed for Delays\nLos Angeles Sees Remote Work Helping \u2018No Car\u2019 2028 Olympic Games\nJohannesburg Mayor Quits Amid Infighting, Financial Woes\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent company on Wednesday offered notes in five parts for general corporate purposes, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The longest portion of the deal, a 40-year security, yields 1.3 percentage points above Treasuries after initial discussions of around 1.55 percentage points, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private.\n\u201cMeta\u2019s sale is a sign that their investment in AI is not slowing down and is likely to increase over the next couple of years,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Schiffman said in a phone interview. \u201cMeta has an ample amount of cash, but it\u2019s a more efficient use of capital to borrow money in the bond market.\u201d\nA representative for Meta didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nThe deal is its biggest high-grade bond sale ever, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The social-media behemoth made its debut in the high-grade bond market in 2022, selling $10 billion. It returned to the market last year with an $8.5 billion deal.\nSome high-flying tech firms that saw their stocks soar this year amid hopes surrounding AI were pressured ahead of the global market selloff, with investors seeking more progress on the technology.

        "Title": "Meta has abandoned efforts to make custom chips for its upcoming AR glasses",
        "Author": "  Kali Hays ",
        "Text": "An ambitious move within Meta to build its own custom chips for use in an expanding line of wearable consumer devices fell victim to ongoing efforts to rein in company costs.\nBack in 2023, while Meta was still deep into cofounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d years of work on the in-house development of computer chips crucial to a planned line of wearable glasses effectively came to an end. Amid mass layoffs and cost-cutting efforts throughout the company, work on custom chips was deemed too expensive, and the need for the chips too far removed from current business priorities, two people familiar with the company and the changes told Fortune.\nInstead of designing its own chips for smart glasses, Meta has shifted gears and opted to rely on third-party chipmakers like Qualcomm for its upcoming prototypes and potential future versions of the augmented reality (AR) glasses, one of the sources said.\nWhile Meta continues to design other types of chips, such as specialized processors to run AI workloads in its data centers, the company\u2019s pullback from custom chips for wearables marks the end of an ambitious project that began in 2019. The chips were set to be the backbone of the wearable gadgets they were being developed for, mainly a line of AR glasses code-named Orion. An \u201cexperimental\u201d prototype of the Orion AR glasses is still set to be revealed by Meta sometime this year, likely in the coming weeks and possibly in September at Meta\u2019s Connect event for developers, one of the people said.\nMeta declined to comment.\nSmart glasses and virtual reality headsets are at the center of Zuckerberg\u2019s vision for the future of computing. The CEO recently predicted that AR and AI-enabled glasses will be used by hundreds of millions of people in the near future.\nWhile Meta generates the overwhelming majority of its revenue from advertising on its various social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, the company has spent tens of billions of dollars building a consumer hardware business. The group, known as Reality Labs, generated a relatively scant $353 million in revenue and an operating loss of $4.5 billion in the most recently ended quarter.\nMeta currently sells a line of Ray-Ban smart glasses through a partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica. The current version incorporates a camera and a chip that connects to a person\u2019s phone, but does not include AR capabilities, which would overlay digital information directly on the lens.\nWhen the Orion project was in its early stages, custom chips were thought necessary to get the kind of performance Zuckerberg ultimately sought. The custom chips were intended as well for a next-gen version of the AR glasses being developed under the project name Apollo, the source familiar with the plan noted. Meta at one point also considered using a custom chip for its popular Quest virtual reality headset, but that idea was killed early on, as was a custom chip for a planned smartwatch that was nixed in its entirety.\nThe design work on the chips for wearables was done by the silicon team within Meta\u2019s hardware division. The team was actually developing three separate chips for AR glasses: one for the \u201cpuck,\u201d a non-wearable processor portion of the glasses; one within the glasses, mainly needed for image recognition; and another processor within the glasses, the sources told Fortune. The individual project names for the chips were Armstrong, Avogadro, and Acropolis, respectively, one of the people familiar with the plan said. There were plans to develop a line of smaller chips, like power management integrated circuits, or PMICs, that have also been abandoned, the person added.\nWhile it\u2019s possible that some of the custom work done over the previous years will be useful for future wearables projects, or lead to Meta using semi-custom chips, the company for now has switched to relying on \u201coff the shelf\u201d XR chips from Qualcomm, one of the sources said. Qualcomm also provides the VR chips used in Meta\u2019s Quest headsets.\nAs for the minds behind this work, scores of Meta employees from the silicon team have been laid off since October. Cuts to the team were first reported by Reuters. One of the sources noted that, once layoffs are completed this year, the silicon team is likely to be whittled down to only a \u201cfew key people\u201d needed to communicate with vendors. Work on a custom chip for Meta\u2019s growing generative-AI needs has also been troubled, according to reporting by Reuters.\nAre you a Meta employee or someone with insight or a tip to share?

        "Text": "There could be signs of trouble looming ahead for the markets. While the economy is still doing relatively well and tech companies are reporting strong numbers, the danger is that in the not-too-distant future, there could be some weakness. And I'm not referring to just the possibility of a recession.\nSpending on artificial intelligence (AI) has helped many tech companies achieve considerable growth in recent quarters, and it has given their valuations a boost. But a slowdown in AI spending could also be what causes them to decline in the near future.\nAI presents a hot new growth opportunity for many tech companies, and some are spending feverishly for the sake of not being caught behind the latest trend. Some big tech CEOs have recently hinted that may indeed be the case.\nIn a recent interview with Bloomberg, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted that, \"there's a meaningful chance that a lot of the companies are overbuilding now and that you look back and you're like, oh, we maybe all spent some number of billions of dollars more than we had to.\" Meta is definitely benefiting from the excitement, integrating its own AI into its social media apps and Ray-Ban smart glasses. And through the first six months of the year, the company's revenue has grown by 25% to $75.5 billion.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai also said, during the company's July 23 conference call with analysts, that \"when we go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here.\" Alphabet has been investing heavily into AI all across its businesses, including into its Gemini chatbot as it looks to rival the success of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Alphabet, like Meta, has also been seeing an uptick in demand this year due to a stronger ad market and resilient economic conditions, Its revenue through the first six months of 2024 has totaled $165.3 billion -- a 14% increase from the same period last year.\nBut the good top-line results shouldn't make investors overlook these leaders' warnings with respect to AI spending, as they corroborate data from research company Gartner, which estimates that at least 30% of generative AI projects may end up being abandoned by the end of next year, suggesting that companies are indeed spending far too heavily on AI.\nIt has been off to the races for companies to develop AI models and their own chatbots for their websites. But as the time comes to quantify and justify whether those projects were truly worthwhile, it may result in a reduction in spending, which would be bad news for the markets.\nAnd if companies scramble to reduce their AI expenses, that could trickle over into less spending on other areas, including advertising and any tech-related expenditures. For Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and other growth stocks, that could mean a slowdown in their growth rates, even if they aren't making next-gen AI chips.\nMany investors justify paying significant multiples for AI stocks these days because of their promising growth prospects. But the risk is that those expectations may not match up to reality, at least, not in the near term, anyway. AI can disrupt some jobs and take over others, but that doesn't mean that every investment into AI will be a worthwhile one.\nInvestors shouldn't ignore these recent warnings from Zuckerberg and Pichai, as there may be a reduction in AI and tech-related spending in the months ahead, which could result in more bearish conditions for highly priced AI stocks. While that doesn't necessarily make all AI stocks bad buys today, investors should be wary of those trading at egregious earnings multiples. And with a recession possibly coming soon as well, there may be more of a reason than ever for investors to temper their expectations for tech stocks as a whole, as their returns could be limited in the near term.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "Text": "Shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) moved higher on Tuesday as the social media giant benefited from the broader recovery in the market following a brutal three-day decline, received a bullish analyst note, and seemed to benefit from a ruling that rival found Alphabet had violated antitrust laws.\nAs a result, Meta stock finished the session up 3.9%.\nA number of new items were pushing Meta stock higher today. First, the company benefited from a broad recovery in the market as fears of a recession seemed to subside and U.S. stocks followed the Japanese Nikkei, which surged after plunging on Monday as the carry trade unwound.\nLoop Capital also raised its price target on Meta from $550 a share to $575 and maintained a buy rating on the stock in response to last week's beat-and-raise report, and noted that Meta's ad business growth outpaced both Amazon and Alphabet in the recent quarter.\nFinally, the stock also seemed to benefit from an antitrust ruling that found Alphabet's payments to companies like Apple to be the default search engine on its devices to be illegal. That decision could have positive repercussions for Meta as it could hurt both Google's reach and Apple's bottom line. Meta considers both companies to be close competitors.\nInvestors should expect Meta to be subject to the broader swings in the market as the macro economy remains volatile, but the stock seems to be well-positioned for further gains given its strong Q2 numbers, reasonable valuation, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's own prediction that Meta AI would be the leading AI chatbot by the end of the year.\nThe stock continues to look like a solid buy.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a0 Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.\u00a0Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nInvestors are on tenterhooks as Jensen Huang\u2019s AI giant is about to release earnings. Gene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner, said in an interview with CNBC that the broader market can see a pullback if Blackwell-related delays show a wider impact on the AI chips market. The analyst predicted that it\u2019s going to be a \u201cdifficult week\u201d for major tech companies.\nHowever, Munster is highly bullish on the broader AI space for the long term.\n\u201cI still think that we are in an early innings of a 3 to 5 year tech bull market that is powered by AI, and I think all these big tech companies are going to do well over the next couple of years,\u201d Munster said.\nThe analyst said that Jensen Huang has indicated in the previous quarters that the demand for AI chips is more than what his company could manage in the short term, and if he reiterates this in the upcoming results, it would give a strong signal to investors about the AI potential.\n\u201cThere is a lot of awareness about AI but I think the significance of what it\u2019s gonna do is still underappreciated by the market.\u201d\nIn this article, we compiled the most important latest AI news and analyst ratings around major AI tech stocks. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\nMark Mahaney, Evercore ISI head of internet research, recently talked about how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) was able to spur revenue growth because of AI during a program on CNBC.\n\u201cIf you look at what happened with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). they went to almost 30% revenue growth, they are growing dollar-wise faster than anybody else that\u2019s because they used AI to rebuild their ad-tech stack because they used AI to rebuild their user interface and get us more engaged, so it actually worked for them.\u201d\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it\u2019s doing would bear more results in the future. After the results, Citi said it remains \u201cincrementally positive\u201d on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares due to engagement and monetization gains, along with expanding margins. The firm raised its price target for META to $580 from $550.\nJPMorgan said it sees AI benefiting Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) at three levels: core Family of Apps (FoA) improvements, new opportunities and experiences, and scaling the Metaverse. It also upped META price target to $610 from $480.\nMorgan Stanley also liked how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is improving its recommendation systems and quality with AI.\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company\u2019s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it\u2019s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year\u2019s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year\u2019s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot,\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Top 10 AI News and Analyst Ratings You Should Not Miss.

        "Text": "Shares of social network operator Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) jumped 9.9% in the morning session after the company reported second quarter earnings results. Meta slightly beat analysts' revenue guidance expectations for the next quarter. In addition, this quarter's revenue and EPS narrowly outperformed Wall Street's estimates.\nLooking ahead, the company expects to continue investing in Reality Labs as its Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses are seeing strong traction. Overall, this quarter seemed fairly positive, and shareholders should feel optimistic. After the initial pop the shares cooled down to $496.63, up 4.7% from previous close.\nIs now the time to buy Meta? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nMeta's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 5 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 6 months ago, when the stock gained 21.9% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, operating income, and EPS, all exceeding analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024, partly explaining why Meta had a strong quarter.\nLooking ahead, Meta's Q1 2024 revenue guidance topped Wall Street's forecast, while its anticipated full-year 2024 capital expenditures came in slightly higher. The company expects this capex growth to come from investments in servers, including AI and non-AI hardware (you're welcome, Nvidia), and data centers as it ramps up construction for its new data center architecture. These investments will be key for its open-source large language model, Llama, to successfully compete against OpenAI's closed-source ChatGPT. Perhaps the most interesting part of the quarter was the announcement of a quarterly dividend - the first in the company's history. Overall, this was a really good quarter that should please shareholders.\nMeta is up 43.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $496.63 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $539.91 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Meta's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,575.\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n"

The company's share price was up 6.1% as of 12:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nMeta Platforms published its second-quarter results after the market closed on Wednesday and reported sales, earnings, and engagement figures that beat Wall Street's targets. The social media company formerly known as Facebook also issued some very encouraging guidance, and its stock has received a wave of price-target increases from analysts.\nMeta posted revenue of $39.07 billion and earnings per share of $5.16 in the second quarter. The company's results came in $760 million higher than the average analyst estimate and beat Wall Street's profit target by $0.40 per share.\nSales were up roughly 22% year over year in the quarter, and per-share profits were up 73%. Even better, the quarter's beats were powered by strengthening engagement and monetization trends that paint a very bullish picture for its ecosystem of services.\nMeta reported 3.27 billion average daily active users in the quarter across its platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The performance represented a roughly 7% year-over-year increase. Total ad impressions and average price per ad each increased 10% compared to the prior-year period.\nFor the third quarter, Meta is guiding for sales between $38.5 billion and $41 billion. Before the update, the average Wall Street target had called for the business to record sales of $39.1 billion in the period. The company's guidance also assumes a 2% currency headwind due to unfavorable exchange rates.\nIt also announced that it now expects its capital expenditures (capex) for the year to be between $37 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous target for capex between $35 billion and $40 billion. Along with comments made during Meta's conference call, the upward narrowing of the guidance range makes it clear that the company isn't taking its foot of the gas when it comes to investing in artificial intelligence.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": " Yasmin Khorram    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Meta (META)\u2019s Reality Labs is still bleeding cash.\nThe division, which focuses on the company\u2019s AR, VR, and metaverse initiatives, reported a loss of $4.48B in its Q2 earnings on Wednesday. Reality Labs revenue accounted for less than 1% of Meta\u2019s total revenue.\nOn Thursday, Meta stock shot up roughly 9% when market opened.\nThe numbers come after Yahoo Finance reported last week that the multibillion-dollar losses at Reality Labs are the result of a lack of a clear vision, frequent restructuring, and leaders who don\u2019t have AR and VR expertise.\nWe interviewed more than a dozen former Reality Labs employees who have been granted anonymity due to non-disclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. Since that report, more insiders have reached out to Yahoo Finance, confirming the details in the story and offering additional insight.\n\u201cA few years ago I would have predicted that holographic AR would be possible before smart AI but now it looks like those technologies will actually be ready in the opposite order,\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. \u201cWe\u2019re well positioned for that because of the Reality Labs investments we\u2019ve already made.\u201d\nLosses in the metaverse division have exploded in the last four years, even as Zuckerberg shifts his focus to AI. In 2020 Reality Labs lost over $6 billion. The unit sunk $10 billion in 2021, $13 billion in 2022 and $16 billion in 2023.\nIn June, Reality Labs laid off roughly 100 employees, according to two people familiar with the matter. The cuts included several vice presidents, managers, as well as dozens of employees in the research division and technology engineering teams. Insiders tell Yahoo Finance that several \u201cbig bets projects\u201d were also canceled.\n\u201cA software company is trying to get into hardware and doesn't know how to manage it,\u201d said a former manager in engineering. \u201cThey\u2019re getting ahead of themselves with product launches and work teams when they don't even know what the technology is yet.\u201d\nMeta\u2019s current hardware products on the market include its Quest 3 and Quest Pro headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses. In April it announced it would offer its operating system, Horizon, to external hardware companies.\nThe company has recently been teasing that its prototype augmented reality glasses is nearly ready to unveil. Referred to internally as \"Orion,\" Meta has thrown tens of billions of dollars at the nine-year-old project.\nHowever, some former employees who worked on the glasses question whether the company will ever release it to the public.\n\u201cI would expect pretty substantial losses per device on the glasses,\u201d a former engineer said. \u201cProbably closer to the $1,000 per unit range, but it depends on what they end up trying selling them for and what features they end up including. They don\u2019t even know if they\u2019ll ever make them to sell.\u201d\nIn 2021, the metaverse became a buzzword following Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement that his social media company, Facebook, would be renamed to Meta. Zuckerberg enthusiastically claimed that humanity would one day in the near future socialize, work, and play in a shared virtual world.\nHowever, recent data suggests the metaverse revolution may be dwindling. Research from consumer analytics firm, CivicScience, found that adoption and intent to purchase AR and VR headsets has plateaued this year.\nAccording to market intelligence firm, IDC Global, shipments of AR and VR headsets dropped some 67% year-over-year in Q1 2024. Meta\u2019s market share has plummeted as others like Apple (AAPL) entered the scene, falling from 62% in Q4 2023 to 37% in Q1 2024.\n\u201cWith AR and VR, Meta came up with a solution when there never really was a problem,\u201d said a former Reality Labs employee. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth the amount of investment they\u2019re putting into it. If they\u2019re smart they\u2019ll scale back to 10% the size of the operation they are now. Someone else can come up with the hardware and use Meta\u2019s Horizon OS. That will make Zuck happier - being part of the Metaverse.\u201d\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

During Wednesday\u2019s extended trading, Meta shares made a 7% jump.\nFor the quarter ended on June 30th, revenue grew 22% YoY to\u00a0$39.07 billion, exceeding LSEG\u2019s estimate of $38.31 billion.\u00a0This is the fourth consecutive quarter that Meta reported revenue growth that exceeds 20%.\nWith higher average prices per ad and more ad impressions across its apps, advertising revenue grew 22% to $38.33 billion,\u00a0showing Meta is continues to dominate the digital ad market, its core business.\u00a0This growth rate is double compared to its biggest rival, Alphabet\u00a0(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), who last week reported Google ad revenue growth of 11% while its YouTube sales fell short of expectations.\nExpenses amounted to $24.2 billion, including charge from its recent $1.4 billion\u00a0agreement to settle a facial recognition data lawsuit by the state of Texas. Capital expenditures of $8.47 billion were below LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of $9.51 billion.\nOperating income climbed 58%\u00a0to\u00a0$14.9 billion as operating margin expanded from last year\u2019s comparable quarter when it amounted to 29% to 38%.\nNet income jumped 73% to $13.47 billion\u00a0with earnings of $5.16 a share surpassing LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of $4.73 per share.\nMeta expects current quarter revenue in the range between\u00a0$38.5 billion and $41 billion.\nAI-related developments\nMeta AI, which rivals offerings from Microsoft-backed (NASDAQ: MSFT)\u00a0OpenAI and Alphabet-owned Google is stated to be on track to become the most used AI assistant by the end of the year.\u00a0But, monetizing this tool will take time.\nWith its AI offerings, Meta also aims to make its core business, advertising, more effective, using these tools to improve ad performance and the overall user experience.\nAfter recently unveiling its most capable open-source AI model yet,\u00a0Llama 3.1\u00a0\u00a0as part of its AI push, Zuckerberg revealed Meta is already working on Llama 4, which it ambitiously aims to become \"the most advanced in the industry next year.\" This speed of development emphasizes\u00a0\u00a0Meta\u2019s determination to ensure that its technology is on par with\u00a0\u00a0that of rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google.\nHeavy AI infrastructure spending to avoid being late.\nLike Google, Microsoft and other tech peers, Meta boosted spending to invest in AI infrastructure, raising concerns about whether these massive costs will pay off.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0Meta CFO Susan Li revealed Meta expects significant CapEx growth in 2025.\u00a0But Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shares the reasoning with Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, prefering to risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than risk being too late.\nMeta\u2019s financials continue to benefit from cost-cutting efforts that Meta kicked off in late 2022. But the highlight of the report was undoubtedly the AI spending spree.\u00a0Although Meta also needs to prove its ambitious AI visions are worth the investment, like Google, Meta is delivering when it comes revenue growth and earnings beats, which is undoutebtedly easing investor concerns.\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Despite this, CEO Mark Zuckerberg remains optimistic about the future prospects of augmented and virtual reality technologies.\nUnlike Quest headsets, the new Puffin device will not include handheld controllers as users will be able to operate it with hand gestures and eye movements, according to the report.\nThe virtual and mixed reality headset market gained renewed attention following Apple's entry last year, although its Vision Pro has faced challenges in sales due to a pricy tag of nearly $3,500.\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Mohammed Safi Shamsi)\n"

        "Author": "  Geoffrey Seiler, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Share prices of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) bolted higher after the owner of Facebook and Instagram reported strong second-quarter results and issued upbeat guidance. The stock has been a great performer this year, up about 40%.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) continues to be a major focus for the social media company, with Meta ready to invest significant money into its newest large language model (LLM) Llama 4.\nLet's dive into Meta's Q2 earnings report and guidance as well as its AI ambitions and whether the stock remains a buy after the run-up in the stock this year.\nMeta grew its Q2 revenue by 22% year over year to $39.1 billion. Ad revenue climbed 22% to $38.3 billion, while Reality Labs, which is developing Meta's metaverse and the Quest Headsets used to access it, grew revenue by 28% year over year to $353 million. Operating income from Apps came in at $19.3 billion, while Reality Labs produced a loss of $4.5 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) soared from $2.98 a year ago to $5.16.\nFamily daily active people (DAP), which measures registered users that log into one of its apps on a daily basis, rose nearly 7% year over year to 3.27 billion in June. Family average revenue per person (ARPP), meanwhile, climbed 14% to $11.89.\nThreads, its newest app, which is akin to X (formerly Twitter), was a standout, reaching 200 million monthly users. WhatsApp, a messaging app that has long been popular overseas, has reached over 100 million active users in the U.S. The company also said it was seeing good traction in adding young adult users to Facebook.\nAd impressions jumped 10% year over year, while the average price per ad also increased 10%. Growth in average price per ad was particularly strong in Europe where it grew 18%.\nLooking ahead, the company expects third-quarter revenue to be between $38.5 billion and $41 billion. The midpoint of $39.75 billion was well ahead of analyst expectations for Q3 revenue at $39.1 billion.\nIt also increased the low end of its full-year capital expenditure (capex) forecast to a range of $37 billion to $40 billion, up from a prior range of $35 billion to $40 billion. Next year, it is looking to significantly increase that number as it invests in AI research and product development.\nIt said the computing power needed to train its next-generation LLM Llama 4 will likely be 10 times more than was needed to train Llama 3, while future models will continue to need more and more computing power. Meta said at this point it would rather build more capacity than it needs than be too late doing so.\nMeta's core social media advertising business is performing well, with users, ad impressions, and ad rates all up nicely. Video and in-feed recommendations are leading to more engagement and helping drive revenue. The company's sites are still among the top places for advertisers to spend their ad dollars.\nMeanwhile, Meta is investing heavily in AI and will look to profit from it in the future. The company has a history of building out products and gaining large user bases before monetizing them, and this appears to be the strategy here. However, with losses piling up with Reality Labs and now the expected big spending on AI, this could become a point of contention with investors down the line.\nHowever, Meta has a pile of cash on its balance sheet and generates robust cash flow, so it certainly has the resources to make these investments. At this point, the investment in AI looks like a good bet to make, while the metaverse is still a bit more questionable.\nFrom a valuation standpoint, the company is now trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 21 based on 2025 analyst estimates.\nThat is certainly a reasonable valuation for a company that owns some of the most attractive sites for advertisers around the globe. Meanwhile, it could prove to be downright cheap if its bets on AI and the metaverse eventually pay off.\nTaking that all together, I think investors with a long-term outlook can still buy the stock at current levels.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

While it\u2019s not entirely clear how Meta will be using the voices, it has discussed a chatbot that could serve as a digital assistant, \u00e0 la Apple\u2019s Siri, or a friend, the people said. Users could speak with a chatbot that has the voice of Awkwafina, for example.\nNegotiations between Meta and some talent representatives have stopped and started many times because the parties can\u2019t agree on terms for use of the actors\u2019 voices. Meta would like to secure rights to voices for many uses over a fixed term on a single project. Representatives for the actors are seeking stricter limits.\nThe use of artificial intelligence has spooked many in the Hollywood creative community who fear losing work as a result of the technology. Screenwriters and actors fought for protections against the use of AI during labor stoppages last year. Yet SAG-AFTRA, the primary unions for actors, has reached an agreement with Meta on terms, according to the people.\nMeta has experimented with creating text-based chatbots inspired by celebrities like Dwyane Wade and Paris Hilton.

        "Title": "Mark Zuckerberg Just Made a Stunning Prediction. Is Meta Platforms Now a Must-Own AI Stock?",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Despite its focus on its LLaMa large language model and new devices like Ray-Ban smart glasses, discussions revolving around investments in top artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have mostly excluded Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META).\nInstead, Nvidia is considered the clear leader in AI hardware, while the financial media has portrayed Microsoft and Alphabet as battling for supremacy in user-facing AI, including chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini, cloud infrastructure, and productivity software.\nBut Meta is proving that potential investors can't continue ignoring its advances in the AI space. The stock has soared since the generative AI race began with the launch of ChatGPT, and it has outpaced its peers in the \"Magnificent Seven\", like Microsoft and Alphabet, in revenue growth over the last four quarters.\nMeta just reported 22% revenue growth to $39.1 billion in the second quarter, and operating income surged 58% to $14.8 billion as the company benefits from earlier layoffs and other cost controls.\nHowever, while investors were impressed by the company's results, sending the stock up 7% after hours, there was one statement in particular from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that could be a game changer for Meta Platforms.\nZuckerberg began the earnings release by telling investors, \"Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.\" That's a statement that few analysts would have expected to be true a year ago\nWhile ChatGPT has gotten much of the attention in the generative AI race, Meta AI is emerging as a dark horse, ready to displace the chatbot that kicked off the generative AI era. If Zuckerberg is correct, Meta's AI chatbot will be ahead of ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, and Alphabet's Gemini, making his company the leader in generative AI, at least according to one key metric, usage.\nMuch like Apple has with its iPhone, Meta's properties, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, have allowed it to establish close relationships with customers. That's something that Microsoft and Alphabet's Google don't have, because their AI properties are mostly used for work or research.\nBeyond Meta's surprising forecast for its chatbot, Zuckerberg also painted a compelling vision for the company's future in AI.\nFor example, he envisions his company using AI to generate creative content for advertisers and personalize it for its intended audience. Eventually, Zuckerberg sees the technology being able to handle the entire marketing campaign with just a business objective and a budget. That would be a huge win for the advertisers that make up the company's customer base.\nHe also said Meta wants to provide every business on his platform with an AI agent, and he believes this will be a staple of commerce in the future.\nThe success of Meta AI is also reflected in the company's broad and growing reach. It finished the quarter with 3.27 billion daily active users, up 7% from the year before -- or more than 40% of the world's population. The average American adult spends 34 minutes a day on Meta properties, showing why the company is poised to take the lead in AI assistants.\nBefore ChatGPT was launched, Zuckerberg said it was incumbent that Meta control the next computing platform. At the time, he envisioned that as the metaverse, but it now seems clear that it will be generative AI, and Meta looks to be just as ready for that transition.\nThe company doesn't have a direct way to monetize Meta AI, but it doesn't need one. As it grows and engages its audiences, businesses will spend more money on advertising to reach them and sell more products and services through its sites, growing Meta's revenue and strengthening its platforms in turn.\nThe company continues to burn billions of dollars each quarter on Reality Labs, and it's unclear if that experiment will ever pay off. However, the core business is profitable enough to support that adventure, and Meta still trades at a modest valuation. Based on its after-hours price Wednesday, the stock is valued at a price-to-earnings ratio of 26.5, essentially in line with the S&P 500.\nBut Meta Platforms is still seeing explosive growth, and it now looks to be a surprising winner in the AI chatbot race. The stock belongs in any AI portfolio and should continue climbing given its momentum, its extensive reach through its apps, and its prowess in artificial intelligence.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "On Wednesday, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) shut down CrowdTangle, a social media analysis tool used for monitoring trending posts on Facebook and Instagram.\nCrowdTangle helped journalists and researchers analyze user engagement, identify key drivers of content spread, and track the virality of political and medical misinformation on social media platforms, as reported by Bloomberg.\nAccording to the report, in July, a bipartisan group of lawmakers requested that CEO Mark Zuckerberg delay CrowdTangle\u2019s shutdown by six months, emphasizing the need for continued access to study the impact of platforms and their algorithms.\nThis week, Meta responded that it would proceed with the shutdown due to maintenance difficulties and concerns that the tool no longer provides a representative view of platform activity.\nIn separate statements, Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, termed Meta\u2019s response as \u201cdisappointing,\u201d and\u00a0Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana added that it \u201conly highlights the need for more oversight and scrutiny of Big Tech.\u201d\nNotably, in March, the social media giant disclosed its intention to replace CrowdTangle with the Meta Content Library, limiting access exclusively to academic and nonprofit researchers and excluding most news outlets.\nMeta stated that CrowdTangle\u2019s decommissioning followed years of its use in studying the spread of misinformation and causing frustration among its leaders due to reporting that often highlighted problematic content spread.\nMeta promised that the Meta Content Library would be an improvement over CrowdTangle with new capabilities, such as measuring content\u2019s reach and accessing public comments data.\nRelated: Meta\u2019s Policy Shift Takes A Toll On Instagram Engagement: Report\nInvestors can gain exposure to the stock via Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF (NYSE:FCOM) and Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC).\nPrice Action: META shares are up 2.06% at $537.59 at the last check on Thursday.\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article Meta Shuts Down Tracking Tool CrowdTangle, Faces Bipartisan Criticism originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned -9.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has lost 7.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +5%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.06 points to a change of +41.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +4.5%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.84 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $40.08 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +17.4%. The $161.35 billion and $183.86 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +19.6% and +14%, respectively.\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $39.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.91%. The EPS surprise was +9.79%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In all, Facebook took down more than 20 million pieces of content in just over a year. Zuckerberg joins other social media executives, including Jack Dorsey, former CEO of blogging platform Twitter, in lamenting past instances of content moderation that, in their view, went too far.\nThere\u2019s a growing global debate over how far social media companies should go in policing the comments, images and other content posted by their users. Some platforms believe they should be hands off when it comes to telling users what they can and can\u2019t say online, while some governments say that an overly laissez-faire stance can beget criminal behavior. French officials arrested Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov during the weekend, alleging that the company failed to adequately combat crime on the messaging app, including the spread of child sexual abuse material.\nOn the eve of the US presidential election, pitting Vice President Kamala Harris against former president Donald Trump, Zuckerberg is also taking pains to appear non-partisan. \u201cMy goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another \u2014 or to even appear to be playing a role,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in the letter, the contents of which were posted to the Facebook page of the House Judiciary Committee and confirmed by Meta.

The Big Tech trio spent a combined $40.5 billion on the infrastructure, land, and chips that power their AI services during the second quarter. And each company indicated that those numbers will only get bigger next year.\nThe rest of the AI info that was served up\u2014particularly anything related to the revenue side of the ledger\u2014amounted to mostly empty rhetoric.\nLet\u2019s start with Meta.

Google said in May that \u201cover 1 million people have signed up to try Gemini Advanced in just three months,\u201d and on its earnings call last week CEO Sundar Pichai said that Gemini is now used in \u201call six of our products with more than 2 billion monthly users\u201d\u2014nice large numbers that don\u2019t really tell us anything. For its part, OpenAI said in May that \u201cevery week, more than a hundred million people use ChatGPT.\u201d\nAll of this suggests that Meta, which now has 3.3 billion daily users across its family of apps, could theoretically declare victory if at year\u2019s end there are 101 million people per week using the AI assistant that it has very conspicuously bolted on to Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. The bar doesn\u2019t appear to be very high.\nAs for when these Meta AI users will lift the company\u2019s top line, Zuckerberg takes a long-term view: Generative AI will not be a meaningful driver of the business for \u201cyears.\u201d Don\u2019t expect generative AI to move the needle next year, or even in 2026, Zuckerberg said\u2014AI revenue in 2025 and 2026 will come from the traditional, behind-the-scenes AI tools that the company uses to improve feed recommendations and advertising, but not from Meta AI.\nSatya Nadella had lots of impressive sounding but similarly hazy data points to share on the Microsoft earnings call, and he unleashed them in a rapid-fire barrage. Azure AI customers increased by more than 60% year over year, with roughly 60,000 customers in total. Microsoft 365 customers increased 60% from the previous quarter, with the majority of enterprise customers \u201ccoming back to purchase more seats.\u201d And the number of customers with more than 10,000 Microsoft seats more than doubled quarter over quarter, we learned, but it was left unspecified if those are all paid seats. (Microsoft confirmed after publication that they were paid seats).\nThe closest Nadella came to dropping a hard number involved GitHub, and the AI \u201ccopilot\u201d that helps computer programmers write code.\nGitHub\u2019s annual revenue \u201crun rate\u201d is now $2 billion, Nadella said. Run rates are a slippery thing, of course\u2014what is the $2 billion run rate extrapolated from: revenue rung up in the most recent quarter? Month? Day? Hour? Nadella didn\u2019t say. But he noted that copilot accounted for over 40% of GitHub\u2019s revenue growth this year (note that this revenue growth is not the same thing as the just-mentioned revenue run rate, so that $2 billion number is not relevant). He then said that GitHub copilot is already a larger business than the entirety of GitHub when Microsoft acquired the company back in 2018.\nThere\u2019s no public number for GitHub\u2019s revenue at the time of its acquisition, since it was a private company. But a New York Times article at the time cites analyst estimates that GitHub\u2019s revenue was \u201crunning at $200 million a year.\u201d\nSo there you have it, one somewhat solid data point about AI from the Big Tech earnings reports: GitHub copilot\u2019s revenue is somewhere just north of $200 million a year, and very likely below $400 million (since Nadella would presumably have described the business as \u201cmore than twice the size\u201d if that were the case, right?).\nWall Street analyst notes recapping the earnings are full of commentary about \u201cstrong demand signals\u201d and promising AI uptake. And Meta\u2019s stock is riding high today, following Wednesday\u2019s earnings report, thanks to the enduring strength of its advertising business. But when you look closely at what we actually learned about generative AI, there\u2019s not much there there.\nCorrection: The number of Microsoft 365 copilot customers increased 60% in Q2, rather than doubled. And the number of customers with at least 10,000 enterprise seats more than doubled, as opposed to the total number of enterprise seats being 10,000.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "Investing.com ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) exceeded market expectations for its second-quarter revenue on Wednesday and provided an optimistic sales forecast for the third quarter, signaling that strong digital ad spending on its social media platforms can offset the costs of its AI investments.\nFor the quarter ending June 30, Meta reported earnings of $5.16 per share on revenue of $39.07 billion, surpassing estimates of $4.70 per share and $38.26 billion.\nDaily active people (DAP) reached 3.27 billion, a 7% increase from the same period last year.\nShares in the Facebook parent popped 7% in premarket trading Thursday.\nCapital expenditures (capex) were $8.47 billion in Q2, up from $6.72 billion in Q1. Despite a 7% rise in costs during the second quarter, the substantial revenue increase led to a 9-point rise in operating margin, climbing to 38% from 29%.\nLooking ahead to Q3, Meta projected total revenue to range between $38.5 billion and $41 billion, with a midpoint of $39.75 billion, surpassing Wall Street's estimate of $39.09 billion.\nThe company also indicated it would continue significant spending on AI infrastructure, forecasting 2024 capital expenditures between $37 billion and $40 billion, up from the previous forecast of $35 billion to $40 billion.\nMeta maintained its total expense forecast for the year at $96 billion to $99 billion but warned that infrastructure costs would remain a \"significant driver\" of expense growth in 2025.\nFollowing the report\u2019s release, numerous Wall Street analysts shared predominantly bullish comments on Meta stock, raising their estimates and price targets.\n\u201cWe emerge from 2Q24 earnings incrementally positive on shares of Meta given engagement&monetization gains and expanding margins,\u201d said Citi analysts, who raised their META target price from $550 to $580.\n\u201cOn engagement, we note newer AI content recommendation models continue to drive usage across Meta\u2019s Family-of- Apps as newer AI-based use cases emerge, like search with Meta AI and Agents with AI Studio. And, while Meta is clearly ramping its investment across its Foundation Models, we believe these investments can deliver tangible short&long-term benefits.\u201d\nMeanwhile, JPMorgan analysts said Meta \u201ccontinues to earn the right to spend big on GenAI\u201d given the company\u2019s strong revenue outlook and greater clarity on the AI product roadmap.\nThe Wall Street firm set its December 2025 price target for Meta stock as high as $610, up from the $480 for December 2024.\n\u201cGenAI will require significant infrastructure investments to train the next generation of large foundational models&Meta is getting ahead of a multi-year capacity ramp, although core products will remain the primary driver of monetization through 2026,\u201d JPMorgan analysts wrote.\nOther investment firms also voiced largely bullish remarks.\nEvercore ISI: \u201cThe stock rightfully traded up 7% in the aftermarket, with META demonstrating very strong Ad revenue growth -- especially with its Q3 outlook -- ongoing product improvements, and significant margin expansion.\u201d\n\u201cLooking for returns on aggressive industry AI spend? Look no further. META has already effectively deployed AI to materially boost its consumer offerings and its advertiser offerings. And there is much more to come. And valuation is still highly reasonable at 21X P/E.\u201d\nCitizens JMP: \u201cWhile Meta\u2019s AI investment cycle is nowhere near done, the company is well positioned to continue to realize AI gains given its distribution with 3.3B people using its apps daily, while simplifying the advertising process for businesses helps to unlock latent demand from both consumers and advertisers.\u201d\n\u201cAs we look over the next few years, growth looks increasingly sustainable, while we can see the company laddering products to sustain growth and we continue to view Meta as a core holding for technology investors as we think estimates can continue to surprise to the upside.\u201d\nMorgan Stanley: \u201cMETA remains the best case study of how GPU-enabled analyses of leading first party data sets can drive material improvements. In this case it comes thru as better engagement and revenue growth (even off of large bases) and a growing list of next gen call options.\u201d\nRelated Articles\nMeta Q2 earnings: Here's what analysts have to say\nModerna reins in 2024 sales forecast, expects very low EU vaccine revenue\nDataDog upgraded at BTIG on strong checks, Splunk displacement opportunity\n"

        "Author": "  BARBARA ORTUTAY ",
        "Text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms has shut down CrowdTangle, a tool widely used by researchers, watchdog organizations and journalists to monitor social media posts, notably to track how misinformation spreads on the company's platforms.\nWednesday's shutdown, which Meta announced earlier this year, has been protested by researchers and nonprofits. In May, dozens of groups, including the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, Human Rights Watch and NYU\u2019s Center for Social Media & Politics, sent a letter to the company asking that it keep the tool running through at least January so it would be available through the U.S. presidential elections.\n\u201cThis decision jeopardizes essential pre- and post-election oversight mechanisms and undermines Meta\u2019s transparency efforts during this critical period, and at a time when social trust and digital democracy are alarmingly fragile,\u201d the letter said.\nCrowdTangle, \u201chas been an essential tool in helping researchers parse through the vast amount of information on the platform and identify harmful content and threats,\u201d it added.\nIn March, the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation sent Meta a similar letter asking it to keep the tool, which was available for free, functioning until January. That letter was also signed by several dozen groups and individual academic researchers.\n\u201cFor years, CrowdTangle has represented an industry best practice for real-time platform transparency. It has become a lifeline for understanding how disinformation, hate speech, and voter suppression spread on Facebook, undermining civic discourse and democracy,\" the Mozilla letter said.\nMeta has released an alternative to CrowdTangle, called the Meta Content Library. But access to it is limited to academic researchers and nonprofits, which excludes most news organizations. Critics have also complained that it's not as useful as CrowdTangle \u2014 at least not yet.\nNick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, said in a blog post last week that the company has been gathering feedback about Meta Content Library from \u201chundreds of researchers in order to make it more user-friendly and help them find the data they need for their work.\u201d\nMeta said Wednesday that CrowdTangle doesn\u2019t provide a complete picture of what is happening on its platforms and said its new tools are more comprehensive.\nMeta acquired CrowdTangle in 2016.\n"

        "Author": "  Davey Alba ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. on Wednesday shuttered CrowdTangle, a popular social media analysis tool that journalists, civic groups and researchers used to monitor trending posts on platforms like Facebook and Instagram in real time.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA Floating Island in Baltimore Raises Hope for a Waterfront Revival\n\u2018Train Lovers\u2019 Organize to Support Harris and Walz in Presidential Bid\nPart of Downtown Montreal Is Flooded After Water Pipe Breaks\nClimate Disasters Are an Affordable Housing Problem\nThe timing of the tool\u2019s shutdown, months ahead of a major US presidential election, has drawn concern from groups that relied on CrowdTangle to track the flow of information on social media, including viral falsehoods that have led to real-world harm. Using CrowdTangle, journalists and researchers could show how many users engaged with a piece of content, which groups supercharged the spread of a post and just how often political and medical misinformation went viral on Facebook and Instagram.\nIn July, a bipartisan group of lawmakers sent Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg a letter asking to delay the discontinuation of CrowdTangle for six months, stating that the company \u201chas a responsibility to ensure that the public, independent researchers, journalists, and policymakers can study and address the impact that platforms and their algorithms are having.\u201d In a response to that letter earlier this week, Meta said it was continuing with CrowdTangle\u2019s shutdown because the tool has been \u201chard to maintain\u201d and \u201cdoes not provide a representative picture of what is happening on our platforms.\u201d\nThe company said it still plans to replace CrowdTangle with the Meta Content Library, a new tool that Meta has argued would include more expansive data, like the ability to analyze comments. Researchers associated with nonprofit institutions must apply to through a third party and Meta partner, the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of Michigan, for access to the library. But news publishers and other groups with commercial interests won\u2019t be eligible to use the tool, which has been criticized for being an inadequate replacement for CrowdTangle. An analysis from Proof News cited 11 features, including the ability to see social media metrics over time and dashboard sharing, that Meta Content Library lacked compared to CrowdTangle when used for research.\nAsked for comment on CrowdTangle\u2019s shutdown, a Meta spokesperson pointed to a November blog post the company wrote to announce the new Meta Content Library tool.\nIn separate statements, Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, called Meta\u2019s response \u201cdisappointing,\u201d and Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said it \u201conly highlights the need for more oversight and scrutiny of Big Tech.\u201d\nCrowdTangle was founded in 2011 and quickly gained popularity among media clients like BuzzFeed, CNN, Vox and NBC for its ability to track trending posts on social media platforms. Five years later, Meta acquired the tool, making it free and expanding its access for others across media. Soon, reporters and researchers were using the tool to investigate topics as diverse as Russian influence operations, misinformation about the Covid-19 pandemic and the QAnon conspiracy movement.\nJournalists\u2019 use of the tool also shed light on Facebook and Instagram users\u2019 high engagement levels with inflammatory conspiracies. In 2021, Meta executives clashed over the issue of data transparency and how much the social network should reveal about popular content on its platform. That July, the New York Times reported that the CrowdTangle team within Meta was being broken up. Meta also rescinded other initiatives, including a $40,000 grant that aimed to help research partners use CrowdTangle data to understand public discussion around the Covid-19 pandemic.\nUntil CrowdTangle\u2019s closure, Meta maintained a list of dozens of case studies showing how researchers used the tool to, for instance, identify Russia-linked influence operations in Africa or track Covid-19 vaccine misinformation.\nIn 2022, Bloomberg reported that Meta had started an official internal process to shutter CrowdTangle. Though the company\u2019s executives have recently framed the shutdown of the tool as necessary because it is \u201cdegrading,\u201d the company had already been devoting dwindling resources to the product, Bloomberg reported. In mid-2022, fewer than five engineers on Facebook\u2019s London integrity team were tasked with keeping CrowdTangle afloat.\nIn their letter to Meta, lawmakers noted that the Meta Content Library provides a view of the platform only at the time a search is conducted, which would make it difficult for researchers to reproduce a search or a study conducted by another. The lawmakers also noted that the constraint \u201climits and complicates the ability of researchers to study what occurred on the platform.\u201d That could make it harder for researchers to investigate, for instance, the origin and spread of election-related misinformation on Facebook and Instagram over time.\nFabio Giglietto, an associate professor of Internet Studies at University of Urbino Carlo Bo in Italy said that he anticipated many researchers would voice their disappointment over the end of CrowdTangle. \u201cThe alternative is not yet fully ready,\u201d Giglietto said, citing difficulties with running queries on the tool using the virtual environment it requires. \u201cThis is particularly frustrating for those who successfully navigated the overly complex application process and cumbersome setup,\u201d he said.\nMeta\u2019s move to sunset CrowdTangle also comes amid relaxed content moderation policies and information integrity efforts across social media platforms.\nThe Global Alliance for Responsible Media \u2014 a nonprofit coalition of major advertisers formed in 2019 to pressure tech platforms to adopt stricter content moderation policies \u2014 last week ceased operations after Elon Musk accused the group of orchestrating a boycott against the platform. The Stanford Internet Observatory, which has focused on election integrity, also was dismantled after a sustained campaign from Republicans to discredit research institutions and their investigations of political influence campaigns on social media platforms.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\u2018I\u2019m So Scared\u2019: NFL Players on How Betting Changes the Sport\nWhere All the Sports Betting Money Actually Goes\nInside Worldcoin\u2019s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity\nSingapore's Wooden Building of the Future Has a Mold Problem\nSports Betting Is Legal, and Sportswriting Might Never Recover\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "WARSAW (Reuters) -Polish billionaire Rafal Brzoska and his wife plan to sue Meta over fake advertisements on Facebook and Instagram that feature his face and false information regarding her circulating on the social media platforms.\nBrzoska said they have not yet decided on a jurisdiction to file the planned lawsuit, which would be another in a series of attempts globally to hold the internet giant accountable for ads that keep appearing even after users inform the company about problems.\nA Meta spokesperson said the company removes false ads from its platforms when it learns about them, and works with local authorities to battle scammers.\nBrzoska, creator of Polish parcel locker company InPost, said he notified Meta of the problem beginning of July, but it failed to find a solution.\n\"We plan to file a private lawsuit against Meta... We have not yet determined in which jurisdictions we will sue Meta. We will decide in the next few weeks,\" Brzoska told Reuters.\n\"...we are considering absolutely all scenarios, including a lawsuit in the United States if there is inaction in Europe,\" he added.\nBrzoska said he and his wife would demand that Meta stop benefiting from the promotion of content that violates their rights and a large compensation donated to a charity, adequate to the level of advertising revenues from spreading this type of disinformation.\nLast week the President of the Personal Data Protection Office obliged Meta Platforms Ireland Limited to stop the display of false advertisements using real data and the images of Brzoska and his wife on Facebook and Instagram in Poland for three months.\n\u201cScammers use every platform available to them to defraud people and constantly adapt to evade getting caught.

        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "Partnership between Sage and Meta Boosts Momentum for Geothermal as First Deal East of the Rocky Mountains, Showcases how Sustainable Energy Sources Can Meet Growing Electricity Demand\nWASHINGTON, August 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, at the U.S. Department Energy\u2019s (DOE) Catalyzing Next Generation Geothermal Development Workshop, Sage Geosystems (Sage) and Meta Platforms, Inc (Meta) announced a new agreement that would significantly expand the use of geothermal power in the U.S. and would be the first use of next generation geothermal power east of the Rocky Mountains. This announcement demonstrates the critical role clean, firm, and resilient power plays in meeting the electricity demand spurred by the growth and innovation led by the technology sector.\nExecutives from Sage and Meta joined U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy David Turk and additional Biden-Harris Administration officials along with, investors, utilities, and other energy stakeholders to discuss the opportunity and growth of geothermal as a growing carbon-free energy source in the U.S. This partnership will deliver up to 150 MW of new geothermal baseload power to support Meta\u2019s data center growth.\nThe Sage and Meta partnership builds on the momentum that geothermal energy is a viable renewable energy source across the U.S and Sage will utilize its proprietary Geopressured Geothermal System (GGS) to provide carbon-free power to Meta\u2019s data centers. This technology, validated in the field in early 2022, marks a significant advancement for the clean energy sector, showcasing the ability to harness geothermal energy virtually anywhere and promising a new era of reliable, sustainable baseload power and enhanced grid stability. Hot dry rock is a vastly abundant resource compared to traditional hydrothermal formations, making Sage\u2019s GGS technology a highly scalable approach with the potential for rapid expansion across the U.S. and globally.\nUrvi Parekh, Head of Renewable Energy at Meta, said, \"Meta thanks the Department of Energy\u2019s leadership on promoting and supporting the exploration of new energy sources like geothermal. That leadership supports Meta\u2019s goal to enable the addition of reliable, affordable, and carbon-free power to the grid with this geothermal energy deal. We are excited to partner with such an innovative company like Sage Geosystems that is a proven leader in geothermal development on this project and beyond.\"\n\"This announcement is the perfect example of how the public and private sector can work together to make the clean energy transition a reality,\" said Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems. \"We are thrilled to be at the forefront of the next generation of geothermal technology and applaud the DOE for supporting the commercialization of innovation solutions. As energy demand continues to grow, the need for reliable, resilient and sustainable power is paramount and our partnership with Meta underscores the critical need for innovative and sustainable energy solutions like ours.\"\n\"The U.S. has seen unprecedented growth in demand for energy as our economy grows, the manufacturing sector booms thanks to the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s Investing in America agenda, and new industries like AI expand,\" said U.S. Energy Deputy Secretary David Turk. \"The Administration views this increased demand as a huge opportunity to add more clean, firm power to the grid and geothermal energy is a game-changer as we work to grow our clean power supply.\"\nThe partnership between Sage and Meta signifies a major step forward in the quest for sustainable energy solutions, reinforcing Sage\u2019s position as a leader in the geothermal revolution and Meta\u2019s dedication to pioneering clean energy initiatives. In addition to this first of a kind geothermal project, Meta continues to invest in carbon-free energy to support its data centers and support the transition to a cleaner and more reliable grid. The first phase of this innovative project will aim to be online and operating in 2027.\nAbout Meta Platforms, Inc.

        "Title": "Alphabet and Meta Platforms Just Sent a Major Warning to Nvidia Shareholders",
        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the booming spending on artificial intelligence (AI) development. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) are a key piece of infrastructure for training and running large language models, the backbone of generative AI. Big tech companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on as many Nvidia GPUs as possible right now.\nThat's been great for Nvidia and its shareholders. Sales more than tripled in its fiscal first quarter, reaching a record $26 billion in total revenue. But that kind of growth can't last forever.\nAnalysts expect more modest sales growth of \"just\" 38.4% next year. But some comments from Nvidia's biggest customers suggest that number might be too high.\nWhile Nvidia has seen its profits soar as a result of all the AI spending, the same isn't necessarily true of a lot of its biggest customers. A step up in capital expenditures like those required to build AI data centers can be a crunch on cash flow. That's especially true if those investments don't produce an immediate impact on revenue.\nThat's the challenge for cloud providers that rent computing infrastructure to developers. The three largest cloud providers are Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. If a developer comes to one of them and needs access to compute power they don't have, it will go to one of its competitors. As a result, they need to build data centers fast enough amid the current AI boom to ensure when a new customer comes to them, or an existing customer asks for more capacity, they can serve them.\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai made this clear when asked about spending on AI during the company's second-quarter earnings call. \"I think the one way I think about it is when we go through a curve like this, the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here,\" he told analysts. In other words, he's intentionally overspending right now to ensure he gets as many customers as possible. Microsoft and Amazon are likely taking a similar approach.\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms is building its own data center capacity to support its AI development. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has ambitions of turning Meta into the leading AI company in the world. And that requires having the infrastructure in place before the company's software is ready for training and deployment.\n\"It's hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future, but at this point I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new infra projects,\" he said during Meta's second-quarter earnings call.\nHis comments echo Pichai's. Meta is spending now with the expectation that it will grow into its capacity. At some point, however, it will rightsize its data centers. At that point, it will significantly slow down its spending on servers and chips like Nvidia's.\nThe reason Nvidia shareholders should pay attention to everything Pichai, Zuckerberg, and a few other big-tech executives say about their AI spending is that the business has become heavily concentrated on those customers.\nTwenty-four percent of Nvidia's total sales in the first quarter came from just two customers. Between 60% and 70% of its revenue comes from just 10 customers, according to Seligman Investments analyst Paul Wick.\nWith all that revenue highly concentrated among just a handful of customers, a single change in the capital expenditure policy at one of them could drastically impact Nvidia's results. If Alphabet or Meta decide to cut back on spending in a couple of years after aggressively building capacity, Nvidia will see its growth slow considerably.\nThe stock is in a precarious position, with Nvidia shares trading at valuation multiples, with around 50x forward earnings and 40x enterprise value to revenue. If it continues to outperform management's guidance and analysts' expectations, the stock will continue zooming higher. But one quarter of poor results could send shares reeling. The comments from Alphabet and Meta suggest it may be only a matter of time before there's a stark pullback in AI spending.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "A new web crawler launched by Meta last month is quietly scraping the internet for AI training data",
        "Author": "  Kali Hays ",
        "Text": "Meta has quietly unleashed a new web crawler to scour the internet and collect data en masse to feed its AI model.\nThe crawler, named the Meta External Agent, was launched last month according to three firms that track web scrapers and bots across the web. The automated bot essentially copies, or \"scrapes,\" all the data that is publicly displayed on websites, for example the text in news articles or the conversations in online discussion groups.\nA representative of Dark Visitors, which offers a tool for website owners to automatically block all known scraper bots, said Meta External Agent is analogous to OpenAI\u2019s GPTBot, which scrapes the web for AI training data. Two other entities involved in tracking web scrapers confirmed the bot\u2019s existence and its use for gathering AI training data.\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp, updated a corporate website for developers with a tab disclosing the existence of the new scraper in late July, according to a version history found using the Internet Archive. Besides updating the page, Meta has not publicly announced the new crawler.\nA Meta spokesman said the company has had a crawler under a different name \u201cfor years,\u201d although this crawler\u2014dubbed Facebook External Hit\u2014 \"has been used for different purposes over time, like sharing link previews.\u201d\n\u201cLike other companies, we train our generative AI models on content that is publicly available online,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWe recently updated our guidance regarding the best way for publishers to exclude their domains from being crawled by Meta\u2019s AI-related crawlers.\u201d\nScraping web data to train AI models is a controversial practice that has led to numerous lawsuits by artists, writers, and others, who say AI companies used their content and intellectual property without their consent. Some AI companies like OpenAI and Perplexity have struck deals in recent months that pay content providers for access to their data (Fortune was among several news providers that announced a revenue-sharing deal with Perplexity in July).\nWhile close to 25% of the world\u2019s most popular websites now block GPTBot, only 2% are blocking Meta\u2019s new bot, data from Dark Visitors shows.\nIn order for a website to attempt to block a web scraper, it must deploy robots.txt, a line of code added to a codebase, in order to signal to a scraper bot that it should ignore that site\u2019s information. However, typically the specific name of a scraper bot needs to be added as well in order for robots.txt to be respected. That\u2019s difficult to accomplish if the name has not been openly disclosed. An operator of a scraper bot can also simply choose to ignore robots.txt \u2013 it is not enforceable or legally binding in any way.\nSuch scrapers are used to pull mass amounts of data and written text from the web, to be used as training data for generative AI models, also referred to as large language models or LLMs, and related tools. Meta\u2019s Llama is one of the largest LLMs available, and it powers things like Meta AI, an AI chat bot that now appears on various Meta platforms. While the company did not disclose the training data used for the latest version of the model, Llama 3, its initial version of the model used large data sets put together by other sources, like Common Crawl.\nEarlier this year, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s co-founder and longtime CEO, boasted on an earnings call that his company's social platforms had amassed a data set for AI training that was even \u201cgreater than the Common Crawl,\u201d an entity that has scraped roughly 3 billion web pages each month since 2011.\nThe existence of the new crawler suggests Meta's vast trove of data may no longer be enough however, as the company continues to work on updating Llama and expanding Meta AI. LLMs typically need new and quality training data to keep improving in functionality. Meta is on track to spend up to $40 billion this year, mostly on AI infrastructure and related costs.\nAre you a Meta employee or someone with insight or a tip to share?

The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com.And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Zuckerberg\nAll right. Thanks, Ken, and hey, everyone. Thanks for joining today. This was a strong quarter for our community and business. We estimate that there are now more than 3.2 billion people using at least one of our apps each day. The growth we're seeing here in the US has especially been a bright spot. WhatsApp now serves more than 100 million monthly actives in the US, and we're seeing good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads as well, both in the US and globally.I'm particularly pleased with the progress that we're making with young adults on Facebook. The numbers we're seeing, especially in the US, really go against the public narrative around who's using the app. A couple of years ago, we started focusing our apps more on 18 to 29 year olds, and it's good to see that those efforts are driving good results. Another bright spot is Threads, which is about to hit 200 million monthly actives. We're making steady progress towards building what looks like it's going to be another major social app. And we're seeing deeper engagement and I'm quite pleased with the trajectory here.The big theme right now is, of course, AI, and I'll focus my comments today on three areas: what AI means for our family of apps and core business, what new AI experiences and opportunities we see, and how AI is shaping our metaverse work. So let's start. Across Facebook and Instagram, advances in AI continue to improve the quality of recommendations and drive engagement. And we keep finding that as we develop more general recommendation models, content recommendations get better.In this quarter, we rolled out our fullscreen video player and unified video recommendation service across Facebook, bringing real longer videos and live into a single experience. And this has allowed us to extend our unified AI systems, which had already increased engagement on Facebook Reels more than our initial move from CPUs to GPUs did.Over time, I'd like to see us move towards a single unified recommendation system that powers all of the content, including things like people you may know across all of our services. We're not there yet. There's still upside and we're making good progress here.AI is also going to significantly evolve our services for advertisers in some exciting ways. It used to be that advertisers came to us with a specific audience they wanted to reach, like a certain age group, geography or interest. Eventually, we got to the point where our ad systems could better predict who would be interested than the advertisers could themselves. But today, advertisers still need to develop creative themselves. And in the coming years, AI will be able to generate creative for advertisers as well, and will also be able to personalize it as people see it.Over the long term, advertisers will basically just be able to tell us a business objective and a budget, and we're going to go do the rest for them. We're going to get there incrementally over time, but I think this is going to be a very big deal.Moving on to some of the brand-new experiences that AI enables, last quarter, we started broadly rolling out our assistant, Meta AI, and it is on track to achieve our goal of becoming the most used AI assistant by the end of the year. We have an exciting road map ahead of things that we want to add. But the bottom line here is that Meta AI feels like it is on track to be an important service, and it's improving quickly both in intelligence and features. Some of the use cases are utilitarian, like searching for information or role-playing difficult conversations before you have them with another person. And other uses are more creative like the new Imagine Yourself feature that lets you create images of yourself doing whatever you want in whatever style you want.And part of the beauty of AI is that it's general. So we're still uncovering the wide range of use cases that it's valuable for. An important part of our vision is that we're not just creating a single AI but enabling lots of people to create their own AIs. And this week, we launched AI Studio, which lets anyone create AIs to interact with across our apps. I think the creators are especially going to find this quite valuable.There are millions of creators across our apps, and these are people who want to engage more with their communities, and their communities want to engage more with them. But there are only so many hours in the day. So now they're going to be able to use AI Studio to create AI agents that can channel them to chat with their community, answer people's questions, create content and more. So I'm quite excited about this. But this goes beyond creators, too. Anyone is going to be able to build their own AIs based on their interests or different topics that they are going to be able to engage with or share with their friends.Business AIs are the other big piece here. We're still in alpha testing with more and more businesses. The feedback we're getting is positive so far. Over time, I think that just like every business has a website, a social media presence, and an e-mail address, in the future, I think that every business is also going to have an AI agent that their customers can interact with. And our goal is to make it easy for every small business, eventually every business, to pull all of their content and catalog into an AI agent that drives sales and saves them money. When this is working at scale, I think that this is going to dramatically accelerate our business messaging revenue. There are a lot of other new opportunities here that I'm excited about too, but I'll save those for another day when we're ready to roll them out.The engine that powers all these new experiences is the Llama family of foundation models. In this quarter, we released Llama 3.1, which includes the first frontier-level open source model as well as new and industry-leading small- and medium-sized models. The 405 billion model has better cost performance relative to the leading closed models. And because it's open, it is immediately the best choice for fine-tuning and distilling your own custom models of whatever size you need. I think we're going to look back at Llama 3.1 as an inflection point in the industry where open-source AI started to become the industry standard just like Linux is.I often get asked why I'm so bullish on open source. I wrote a letter, along with the Llama 3.1 release, explaining why I believe that open source is better for developers, for Meta, and for the world more broadly. My view is that open source will be safer, will enable innovation that improves all of our lives faster and will also create more shared prosperity.For Meta's own interests, we're in the business of building the best consumer and advertiser experiences. And to do that, we need to have access to the leading technology infrastructure and not get constrained by what competitors will let us do. But these models are ecosystems. They're not just kind of isolated pieces of software that we can develop by ourselves.So if we want the most robust ecosystem of tools, efficiency improvements, silicon optimizations, and other integrations to develop around our models, then we need them to be widely used by developers across the industry. And once we know that we're going to have access to the leading models, then I'm confident that we're going to be able to build the best social and advertising experiences.Part of why I'm so optimistic about this is that we have a long track record of success with open source. We've saved billions of dollars with Open Compute Project by having supply chain standardized on our infra designs. Open sourcing tools like PyTorch and React has led to real benefits for us from all of the industry's contributions. This approach has consistently worked for us and I expect it will work here, too.Another major area of focus is figuring out the right level of infra capacity to support training more and more advanced models. Llama 3 is already competitive with the most advanced models, and we're already starting to work on Llama 4, which we're aiming to be the most advanced in the industry next year. We are planning for the compute clusters and data we'll need for the next several years. The amount of compute needed to train Llama 4 will likely be almost 10x more than what we used to train Llama 3.And future models will continue to grow beyond that. It's hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future. But at this point, I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new infra projects. And as we scale these investments, we're of course going to remain committed to operational efficiency across the company.The last area that I want to discuss is how AI is shaping our metaverse work, which continues to be our other long-term focus. Last quarter, I discussed how advances in AI have pulled in the timelines for some of our products. A few years ago, I would have predicted that holographic AR would be possible before smart AI, but now it looks like those technologies will actually be ready in the opposite order.We're well positioned for that because of the Reality Labs investments that we've already made. Ray-Ban Meta glasses continue to be a bigger hit sooner than we expected, thanks in part to AI. Demand is still outpacing our ability to build them, but I'm hopeful that we'll be able to meet that demand soon. EssilorLuxottica has been a great partner to work with on this, and we are excited to team up with them to build future generations of AI glasses as we continue to build our long-term partnership. Quest 3 sales are also outpacing our expectations. And I think that's because it is not just the best MR headset for the price but it's the best headset on the market, period.In addition to gaming, people are increasingly taking advantage of Quest's capabilities as a general computing platform, spending time watching videos, browsing websites, extending their PC via virtual desktop and more. Horizon also continues to grow across the VR, mobile, and desktop, and I expect that it will become an increasingly important part of that ecosystem as well. We're hosting our annual Connect Conference on September 25, and we will have lots of exciting updates around all of our AI and metaverse work, so I encourage you to tune into that.At the end of the day, we are in the fortunate position where the strong results that we're seeing in our core products and business give us the opportunity to make deep investments for the future. And I plan to fully seize that opportunity to build some amazing things that will pay off for our community and our investors for decades to come. The progress we're making on both the foundational technology and product experiences suggests that we're on the right track. I'm proud of what our team has accomplished so far, and I'm optimistic about our ability to execute on the opportunities ahead. As always, thank you to our teams who are pushing all this important work forward, and thanks to all of you for being on this journey with us.And now here's Susan.\nSusan Li\nThanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q2 total revenue was $39.1 billion, up 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis. Q2 total expenses were $24.2 billion, up 7% compared to last year.In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 23%, driven primarily by higher infrastructure and Reality Labs inventory costs. R&D increased 13%, primarily driven by higher headcount-related expenses and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Marketing and sales decreased 14% due mainly to lower restructuring and headcount-related costs. G&A decreased 12% mostly due to lower legal-related expenses.We ended the first quarter with almost 70,800 employees, up 2% from Q1. Second-quarter operating income was $14.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 11%. Net income was $13.5 billion or $5.16 per share.Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $8.5 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $10.9 billion. We repurchased $6.3 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders, ending the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt.Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our family of apps segment. Our community across the family of apps continues to grow, with approximately 3.27 billion people using at least one of our family of apps on a daily basis in June. Q2 total family of apps revenue was $38.7 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Q2 family of apps ads revenue was $38.3 billion, up 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis.Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by gaming and entertainment and media. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in rest of world and Europe at 33% and 26%, respectively. Asia Pacific grew 20% and North America grew 17%. On an advertiser geography basis, total revenue growth continued to be strongest in Asia Pacific at 28%, though growth was below the first quarter rate of 41% as we lapped a period of stronger demand from China-based advertisers.In Q2, the total number of ad impressions served across our services and the average price per ad both increased 10%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia Pacific and rest of world. Pricing growth was driven by increased advertiser demand, in part due to improved ad performance. This was partially offset by impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing regions and services. Family of apps other revenue was $389 million, up 73%, driven primarily by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp business platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our family of apps.In Q2, family of apps expenses were $19.4 billion, representing approximately 80% of our overall expenses. Family of apps expenses were up 4%, mostly due to higher infrastructure and headcount-related expenses, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Family of apps operating income was $19.3 billion, representing a 50% operating margin.Within our Reality Labs segment, Q2 was $353 million, up 28%, driven primarily by Quest headset sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.8 billion, up 21% year over year, driven mainly by higher headcount-related expenses and Reality Labs inventory costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $4.5 billion.Turning now to the business outlook, there are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community, and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. To deliver engaging experiences, we remain focused on executing our priorities, including video and in-feed recommendations. On Instagram, Reels engagement continues to grow as we make ongoing enhancements to our recommendation systems. Part of this work has been focused on increasing the share of original posts within recommendations so people can discover the best of Instagram, including content from emerging creators. Now, more than half of recommendations in the US come from original posts.On Facebook, we're seeing encouraging early results from the global rollout of our unified video player and ranking systems in June. This initiative allows us to bring all video types on Facebook into one viewing experience, which we expect will unlock additional growth opportunities for short-form video as we increasingly mix shorter videos into the overall base of Facebook video engagement.We expect the relevance of video recommendations will continue to increase as we benefit from unifying video ranking across Facebook and integrating our next-generation recommendation systems. These have already shown promising gains since we began using the new systems to support Facebook Reels recommendations last year. We expect to expand these new systems to support more surfaces beyond Facebook video over the course of this year and next year.We're also seeing good momentum with our longer-term engagement priorities, including generative AI and Threads. People have used Meta AI for billions of queries since we first introduced it. We're seeing particularly promising signs on WhatsApp in terms of retention and engagement, which has coincided with India becoming our largest market for Meta AI usage. You can now use Meta AI in over 20 countries and 8 languages. And in the US, we're rolling out new features like Imagine Edit, which allows people to edit images they generate with Meta AI.Beyond generative AI, the Threads community also continues to grow and deepen their engagement as we ship new features and enhance our content recommendation systems.Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. There are two parts to this work. The first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. We continue to see opportunities to grow ad supply on lower monetizing surfaces like video, including within Facebook as the mix of overall video engagement shifts more to shorter videos over time, which creates more ad insertion opportunity.More broadly, we are continuing to get better at determining the best ads to show and when to show them during a person session across both Facebook and Instagram. This is enabling us to drive revenue growth and conversions without increasing the number of ads or, in some cases, even reducing ad load.The second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance. We continue to be pleased with our progress here, with AI playing an increasingly central role. We're improving ad delivery by adopting more sophisticated modeling techniques made possible by AI advancements, including our Meta Lattice ad ranking architecture, which continued to provide ad performance and efficiency gains in the second quarter.We're also making it easier for advertisers to maximize ad performance and automate more of their campaign setup with our Advantage+ suite of solutions. We're seeing these tools continue to unlock performance gains, with a study conducted this year demonstrating 22% higher return on ad spend for US advertisers after they adopted Advantage+ shopping campaigns.Advertiser adoption of these tools continues to expand, and we're adding new capabilities to make them even more useful. For example, this quarter, we introduced flexible format to Advantage+ shopping, which allows advertisers to upload multiple images and videos in a single ad that we can select from and automatically determine which format to serve in order to yield the best performance. We have also now expanded the list of conversions that businesses can optimize for using Advantage+ shopping to include an additional 10 conversion types, including objectives like add to cart.Looking forward, we believe generative AI will play a growing role in how businesses market and engage with customers at scale. We expect this technology will continue to make it easier for businesses to develop customized and diverse ad creatives. We've seen promising early results since introducing our first generative AI ad features, image expansion, background generation, and text generation, with more than 1 million advertisers using at least one of these solutions in the past month. In May, we began rolling out full image generation capabilities into Advantage+ creative, and we're already seeing improved performance from advertisers using the tool.Finally, we expect AI will help businesses communicate with customers more efficiently through messaging. We're starting by testing the ability for businesses to use AI in their chats with customers to help sell their goods and services and to generate leads. While we are in the early stages, we continue to expand the number of advertisers we're testing with and have seen good advances in the quality of responses since we began using Llama 3.Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation, which remains unchanged. We continue to invest both in enhancing our core experiences in the near term and developing technologies that we believe will transform how people engage with our services in the years ahead. We expect that having sufficient compute capacity will be central to many of these opportunities. So we are investing meaningfully in infrastructure to support our core AI work in content ranking and ads as well as our generative AI and advanced research efforts.Our ongoing investment in core AI capacity is informed by the strong returns we've seen and expect to deliver in the future as we advance the relevance of recommended content and ads on our platform. While we expect the returns from generative AI to come in over a longer period of time, we are mapping these investments against the significant monetization opportunities that we expect to be unlocked across customized ad creative, business messaging, a leading AI assistant, and organic content generation.As we scale generative AI training capacity to advance our foundation models, we will continue to build our infrastructure in a way that provides us with flexibility in how we use it over time. This will allow us to direct training capacity to gen AI inference or to our core ranking and recommendation work when we expect that doing so would be more valuable. We will also continue our focus on improving the cost efficiency of our workloads over time.Reality Labs remains our other long-term initiative that we continue to invest meaningfully in. Quest 3 is selling well and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are showing very promising traction with the early signals that we are seeing across demand, usage, and retention increasing our confidence in the long-run potential of AR glasses. Finally, as we pursue these investments across near and long-term priorities, we will remain focused on operating the business efficiently.Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect third-quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $38.5 billion to $41 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 2% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates.Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96 (technical difficulty) with our expanded infrastructure footprint. Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion, updated from our prior range of $35 billion to $40 billion. While we continue to refine our plans for next year, we currently expect significant CapEx growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.In closing, Q2 was another good quarter. We continue to execute well across our business priorities and have exciting opportunities in front of us to deliver more value to the people and businesses using our products around the world.With that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) Brian Nowak, Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak\nI have two: one for Mark, one for Susan. Mark, I wanted to sort of go back to some of the new generative AI-enabled use cases for users and advertisers. You talked about Meta AI, Studio, chatbots, [foundation] models. If you could just sort of hone in on one or two of those that you're most excited about, where you're seeing good signal that could be a real driver for the business in '25, '26, just so we sort of know where are you most focused on all those opportunities, it'd be helpful.And the second one, Susan, you have a lot of CapEx priorities from building new infrastructure for next-generation models, compute capacity. Just walk us through again on the CapEx philosophy and any guardrails you have around ensuring you generate a healthy return on invested capital for investors from all the CapEx.\nMark Zuckerberg\nI can take the first one. So I think the things that will drive the most results in '25 and '26 are actually the first category of things that I talked about in my comments, which are the ways that AI is shaping the existing products. So the ways that it's improving recommendations and helping people find better content as well as making the advertising experiences more effective. I think there's a lot of upside there. Those are already products that are at scale. The AI work that we're doing is going to improve that. It will improve the experience and the business results.The other areas that we're working on, I mean, I think you all know this from following our business for a while, but we have a relatively long business cycle of starting a new product, scaling it to something that reaches 1 billion people or more, and only then really focusing on monetizing at scale. So realistically, for things like Meta AI or AI Studio, these are things that I think will increase engagement in our products and have other benefits that will improve the business and engagement in the near term. But before we're really talking about monetization of any of those things by themselves, I mean, I don't think that anyone should be surprised that I would expect that that will be years, right? I think that that's like what we've seen with Reels. It's what we sell with all these things.But I think for those who have followed our business for a long time, you can also get a pretty good sense of when things are going to work years in advance. And I think that the people who bet on those early indicators tend to do pretty well, which is why I wanted to share in my comments the early indicator that we had on Meta AI, which is, I mean, look, it's early. Last quarter, we -- I think it just started rolling it out a week or two before our earnings call. This time, we're a few months later. And what we can say is I think we are on track to achieve our goal of being the most used AI assistant by the end of this year. And I think that's a pretty big deal.Is that the only thing we want to do? No. I mean, we obviously want to grow that and grow the engagement on that to be a lot deeper, and then we'll focus on monetizing it over time. But the early signals on this are good, and I think that that's kind of all that we could reasonably have insight into at this point. But I do think that part of what's so fundamental about AI is it's going to end up affecting almost every product that we have in some way. It will improve the existing ones and will make a whole lot of new ones possible. So it's why there are all the jokes about how all the tech CEOs get on these earnings calls and just talk about AI the whole time. It's because it's actually super exciting, and it's going to change all these different things over multiple time horizons.\nSusan Li\nAnd Brian, I can take the second question. On the ROI part of your question, I would broadly characterize our AI investments into two buckets: core AI and gen AI. And the two are really at different stages as it relates to driving revenue for our businesses and our ability to measure returns.On our core AI work, we continue to take a very ROI-based approach to our investment here. We're still seeing strong returns as improvements to both engagement and ad performance have translated into revenue gains, and it makes sense for us to continue investing here. Gen AI is where we're much earlier, as Mark just mentioned in his comments. We don't expect our gen AI products to be a meaningful driver of revenue in '24. But we do expect that they're going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment while we're also open sourcing subsequent generations of Llama.And we've talked about the four primary areas that we're focused here on the gen AI opportunities to enhance the core ads business, to help us grow in business messaging, the opportunities around Meta AI, and the opportunities to grow core engagement over time.The other thing I would say is we're continuing to build our AI infrastructure with fungibility in mind so that we can flex capacity where we think it will be put to best use. The infrastructure that we build for gen AI training can also be used for gen AI inference. We can also use it for ranking and recommendations by making certain modifications like adding general compute and storage. And we're also employing a strategy of staging our data center sites at various phases of development, which allows us to flex up to meet more demand and less lead time if needed while limiting how much spend we're committing to in the outer years. So while we do expect that we are going to grow CapEx significantly in 2025, we feel like we have a good framework in place in terms of thinking about where the opportunities are and making sure that we have the flexibility to deploy it as makes the most sense.\nOperator\nMark Shmulik, Bernstein.\nMark Shmulik\nJust as we look at the revenue guidance and the outlook, Susan, any color you can share on just kind of the state of the overall digital ad market? And you've highlighted some areas where you're seeing strength versus kind of some of the idiosyncratic efforts you've made to kind of improve the efficacy of the ad product.\nSusan Li\nWe're continuing to see healthy global advertising demand, and we're also delivering ongoing ad performance improvements just related to all of the investments that we've continued to make over time in improving the sort of ads, targeting ranking, delivery, all of the fundamental infrastructure there. And we expect that all of that will continue to benefit ad spend in Q3. We do expect year-over-year growth to slow in Q3 as we are lapping strong growth from China-based advertisers as well as strong Reels impression growth from a year ago. And we also expect modestly larger FX headwinds in Q3 based on current rates.\nOperator\nEric Sheridan, Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan\nI'll just ask one. You called out building community size and what's happened in the United States as well as Threads. How are you thinking about those newer faster-growing elements of either Messaging or Threads as a platform and the mix between the potential for engagement growth and overall monetization longer term of either the messaging layer or Threads and what you're most excited about there to build to sort of capitalize on scale but bring it back towards monetization?\nMark Zuckerberg\nI can start, and Susan can jump in if she has anything else that she wants to add. So the WhatsApp stat, I think, is really important as a business trend just because the United States punches above its weight in terms of, it's such a large percent of our revenue.So before, WhatsApp was sort of the leading messaging app in many countries around the world but not in the US And I think now that we're starting to make inroads into leading in the US as more and more people use the product and realize that, hey, it was a really good experience, the best experience for cross-platform communication and groups and on all these different things, I think that, that's going to just mean that all of the work that we're doing to grow the business opportunity there over time is just going to have a big tailwind if the US ends up being a big market.So that's one reason why it's really relevant. It's obviously also personally somewhat gratifying to see all the people around us starting to use WhatsApp, so I think that's pretty fun but maybe somewhat less relevant from a business perspective. Threads, I think it's another example of something that it got off to about as good of a start of any app that I can think of. I think it was the fastest-growing app to 100 million people. And it's a good reminder that even when you have that start, the path from there to 1 billion people using an app is still multiple years. And that's our product cycle.And I think that that's something that is a little bit different about Meta in the way we build consumer products and the business around them than a lot of other companies that ship something and start selling it and making revenue from it immediately. So I think that's something that our investors and folks thinking about analyzing the business, if needed, to always grapple with is all these new products, we ship them and then there's a multiyear time horizon between scaling them and then scaling them into not just consumer experiences but very large businesses.But the thing that I think is just super exciting about Threads is that we've been building this company for 20 years, and there are just not that many opportunities that come around to grow 1 billion-person app. I mean, there are, I don't know, maybe a dozen of them in the world or something, right? I mean, there are certainly more of them outside the company than inside the company, but we do pretty well and being able to add another one to the portfolio if we execute really well on this is just really exciting to have that potential.Now obviously, there's a ton of work between now and there. I mean, we're almost at 200 million. So it's a really good milestone, I'm excited about that. A lot of work between this and it being a large part of the business. But I do think that these kind of opportunities are pretty rare and that's something that we're just really excited about. I think the team is doing great work on it.\nSusan Li\nEric, I would just add to that in terms of nearer-term sources of impression growth, we really expect that video is going to remain a source of impression growth for us in the second half. On Instagram, we expect Reels to continue to drive growth, while on Facebook, we expect to grow overall video time while increasing the mix of short-form video, which creates more impression growth opportunities. And generally, we expect continued community growth across our apps.\nOperator\nDoug Anmuth, JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth\nOne for Mark, one for Susan. Mark, just in terms of infrastructure and CapEx, you've talked about currently building out not just for Llama 3 and 4 but really out to 7 perhaps and then Llama 4, 10x the compute required versus Llama 3. Just given how much you're building ahead, how does that influence the shape of the CapEx curve over a multiyear period?And then Susan, if you could talk a little bit more about the 3Q outlook. I know you're talking about tougher comps, but at the same time, it really suggests only one point of FX neutral decel at the high end. So just curious if there's anything else you can point to more specifically that's driving the expected strength here.\nSusan Li\nThanks, Doug. I can go ahead and talk about both of those. So your first question was sort of about the longer-term CapEx outlook. We haven't really shared an outlook sort of on the longer-term CapEx trajectory. In part, infrastructure is an extraordinarily dynamic planning area for us right now. We're continuing to work through what the scope of the gen AI road maps will look like over that time.Our expectation, obviously again, is that we are going to significantly increase our investments in AI infrastructure next year, and we'll give further guidance as appropriate. But we are building all of that CapEx, again with the factors in mind that I talked about previously, thinking about both how to build it flexibly so we can deploy to core AI and gen AI use cases as needed and making sure that we both feel good about the returns that we're seeing on the core AI investments, which we're able to measure more immediately. And then we feel good about the opportunities in the gen AI efforts.Your second question was about the Q3 revenue outlook. Again, I mentioned this earlier, we have seen healthy global advertising demand on our platform. We're delivering ongoing ad performance improvements, which, again, we feel like is a result of many, many quarters of effort that have accrued and will continue to accrue value to our platform. And we saw basically in Q2 where revenue grew 22%, that there was broad-based strength across regions and verticals, including particular strength among smaller advertisers, and we expect that generally to continue into Q3.\nOperator\nJustin Post, Bank of America.\nJustin Post\nI just want to get back to the comment on US young adult user growth, especially maybe on Facebook and Instagram. I know you made a big change with Reels a couple of years ago. But what are those users doing on Facebook and Instagram? And can you give us any quantification of the usage growth?\nSusan Li\nThanks, Justin. So building products with young adults in mind has been a core priority area for the Facebook team in recent years, and we've been very encouraged to see these efforts translate into engagement growth with this cohort. We've seen healthy growth in young adult app usage in the US and Canada for the past several quarters.And we've seen that products like Groups and Marketplace have seen particular traction with young adults. Posting to groups in the US and Canada has been growing. That's been boosted mainly by young adults. And we also see that they are active users of Marketplace, which has benefited from product improvements and strong demand for secondhand products in the US.\nOperator\nMark Mahaney, Evercore ISI.\nMark Stephen Mahaney\nI was going to ask about Marketplace so that's a nice segue. It's a great, somewhat under-monetized or arguably very under-monetized asset. I know you indirectly monetize it and it's a very large marketplace. It may even be bigger than eBay. Your thoughts on what you may want to do in the future in terms of monetizing it, in part, maybe even improve the quality of the Marketplace.And then secondly, I just want to ask you about headcount. It's down about 1% year over year. You're pretty much back at par with where the employee headcount was prior to significant reduction. How should we think about headcount growth going forward? Did you talk about a significant growth in CapEx? Should we expect a moderate growth in headcount significant? Any thoughts on that would be helpful.\nSusan Li\nThanks, Mark. On your first question about Marketplace, again, we're obviously excited that it's been one of the drivers of strength in young adults. I would probably just say that more generally, Marketplace is one prong in a broader commerce strategy that we have, which continues to be focused on basically creating the best shopping experience on our platform.Marketplace is obviously consumer-oriented. The broader part of the commerce strategy is about making it easier for businesses to advertise their products, for buyers to find and purchase relevant items on our platform. And to that end, I would say that we feel quite happy with also the investments we've been making in Shops ads. Shops ads revenue is growing at a strong year-over-year pace. We're seeing Shops ads drive incremental performance for advertisers, and it's also working well in combination with some of our other products like Advantage+ shopping.Your second question was about headcount. We continue to be disciplined about where we're allocating new headcount to ensure that it's really focused on our core company priorities, but we're also working down a prior hiring underrun.And as we further close that hiring underrun over the course of this year, I do expect that we will end 2024 with in-seat reported headcount that is meaningfully higher than where we ended 2023. We aren't providing sort of 2025 headcount growth expectations yet as we haven't started our budgeting process yet. But again, I expect that we will primarily target our hiring to focus on priority areas, and we will be running a very disciplined headcount process.\nOperator\nYoussef Squali, Truist Securities.\nYoussef Squali\nSo the AI system using Llama 3.1 has been incorporated in different variations and looks really impressive and seems to be getting closer to becoming a full search engine for virtually everything except for commercial queries so far. So are there any plans to open it up to the broader web? Kind of like what may be OpenAI is off to testing, maybe link it to third-party marketplaces for commercial search, et cetera.And then on Ray-Ban, can you maybe talk a little bit more about the opportunity to deepen your relationship with EssilorLuxottica? What would that look like? What kind of areas are the most exciting to you, Mark, in that relationship?\nMark Zuckerberg\nYes. I'm very excited with how Llama 3.1 landed. I think the team there is doing really great work going from the first version of Llama, the Llama 2 last year that was a generation behind the frontier and now Llama 3.1, which is basically competitive and, in some ways, leading the other top closed models. Meta AI uses a version of Llama 3.1 as well as a bunch of other services that we've built to kind of build a cohesive product.And when I was talking before about we have the initial usage trends around Meta AI but there's a lot more that we want to add, things like commerce and you can just go vertical by vertical and build out specific functionality to make it useful in all these different areas are eventually, I think, what we're going to need to do to fulfill the potential around just being the ideal AI assistant for people.So it's a long road map. I don't think that this stuff is going to get finished in the next couple of quarters or anything like that. But this is part of what's going to happen over the next few years as we build something that will, I think, just be a very widely used service. So I'm quite excited about that. And we're going to continue working on Llama, too. So I mean, you mentioned Llama, and I think the question was a little more about Meta AI but they're both -- I mean, they're related. Llama is sort of like the engine that powers the product and it's open source, and I'm just excited about the progress that we're making on both of those.On the smart glasses, EssilorLuxottica is a great partner. We are now in the second generation of the Ray-Ban Meta glasses. They're doing well, better than I think we had expected, and we expected them to grow meaningfully from the first generation so that's been a very positive surprise. And I think part of that is that it's just well positioned to dovetail well with the AI revolution that we're seeing and offering all kinds of new functionality there. So that was great.But EssilorLuxottica is a great company that has a lot of different products that we hope to be able to partner with to just continue building new generations of the glasses and deepen the AI product and make it better and better. I think there's a lot more to go from here. And compared to what we thought at this point, it's doing quite well compared to, I think, what it needs to be, to be like a really leading piece of consumer electronics, I think we're still early but all the signs are good.\nOperator\nRon Josey, Citi.\nRonald Josey\nI want to get back, Mark, to the commentary on open source and Llama 3. Totally understand that Meta is not offering a public cloud, and so what I wanted to hear from you is maybe a little bit more on the product vision of products that come out of Llama 3. And meaning potentially offering some of these products to other companies, call it, for customer service or call center offerings or other verticals. And so any insights on just how you envision maybe the open source and Llama 3.1 can sort of offer greater enterprise services for others to benefit from?\nMark Zuckerberg\nSo Llama is the foundation model that people can shape into all kind of different products. So whether it's Meta AI for ourselves or the AI Studio or the business agents or like the assistant that's in the Ray-Ban glasses, like all these different things are basically products that have been built with Llama.And similarly, any developer out there is going to be able to take it and build a whole greater diversity of different things as well. Like I talked about, I think the reason why open sourcing -- this is so valuable for us is that we want to make sure that we have the leading infrastructure to power the consumer and business experiences that we're building.But the infrastructure, it's not just a piece of software that we can build in isolation. It really is an ecosystem with a lot of different capabilities that other developers and people are adding to the mix, whether that's new tools to distill the models into the size that you want for a custom model, or ways to fine-tune things better or make inference more efficient or all different other kinds of methods that we haven't even thought of yet, the silicon optimizations that the silicon companies are doing, all the stuff. It's an ecosystem. So we can't do all that ourselves.And if we built Llama and just kind of kept it within our walls, then it wouldn't actually be as valuable for us to build all the products that we're building as it's going to end up being. So that's the business strategy around that. And that's why we don't feel like we need to necessarily build a cloud and sell it directly in order for it to be a really positive business strategy for us.And part of what we're doing is working closely with AWS, I think, especially did great work for this release. Other companies like Databricks, NVIDIA, of course, other big players like Microsoft with Azure, and Google Cloud, they're all supporting this. And we want developers to be able to get it anywhere. I think that's one of the advantages of an open source model like Llama is -- it's not like you're locked into one cloud that offers that model, whether it's Microsoft with OpenAI or Google with Gemini or whatever it is, you can take this and use it everywhere and we want to encourage that. So I'm quite excited about that.The enterprise and business applications that we're going to be most focused on, though, in addition to just optimizing the advertiser experience like I talked about in my comments earlier, it is the business agent piece. I just think that there's a huge potential like I said earlier. I think pretty much every business today has an e-mail address, they have a website, they have social media accounts. I think in the future, they're going to have at least one, if not multiple, business agents that can do the whole range of things from interacting to help people buy things to helping support the sales that they've done if they have issues with the product, if they need to get in touch with you for something.And we already see people interacting with businesses over messaging working quite well in countries that have low cost of labor. But the thing is that in order to have someone answering everyone's questions is quite expensive in a lot of countries. And I think that this is like a thing that AI, I think, is just going to be very well suited towards doing.And when we can make that easy for the hundreds of millions of businesses that use our platforms to pull in all their information and their catalogs and the history and all the content that they've shared and really just quickly stand up an agent, I think that's going to be awesome. So we can combine Llama with a lot of custom work that we're doing in our business teams and couple that with all the other investment that the rest of the ecosystem is doing to make Llama good. And I think that's going to be huge, but that's just one area. This really goes across all of the different products that we're building, both consumer and business. So it's a lot of exciting stuff.\nKenneth Dorell\nKrista, we have time for one last question.\nOperator\nRoss Sandler, Barclays.\nRoss Sandler\nMark, so on Monday in your interview with Jensen, you said something along the lines of if scaling ended up stopping one day, you'd have five years of product work to do and ahead of you. So outside of agents or AI assistants, what other areas in AI are you thinking about or looking at in that five-year road map?And then the second question is maybe one more stab at the capacity question. You guys said that Llama 3.1 was trained on 16,000 H100s. You've also said that you're going to have 600,000 available by year-end. So even if we kind of go up to 160,000 GPUs for Llama 4, we have plenty of extra capacity for inference and future products. How are you guys modeling out this entire kind of CapEx road map between training, inference, and future things? That's all.\nMark Zuckerberg\nI can start with the first one, and then I'll let Susan answer the second one. It's an interesting question. It's a little hypothetical because I mean, I do think it's true that if, let's say, there were no future foundation models. I think there would just be a huge amount of product innovation that the industry would bring to bear, and that just takes time. But then at the same time, there are going to be future foundation models and they're going to be awesome and unlock new capabilities and we're planning our products around those. So I'm not really planning our product roadmap assuming that there isn't future innovation.On the contrary, we are planning what's going to be in Llama 4 and Llama 5 and beyond based on what capabilities we think are going to be most important for the road map that I just laid out for having the breadth of utility that you're going to need in something like Meta AI, making it set businesses and creators and individuals can stand up any kind of AI agents that they want, that you're going to have these kind of real-time, multimodal glasses with you all the time that will just be increasingly useful for all the things that you're doing.I guess this kind of dovetails what I'd expect Susan to talk about next. And we do have this huge set of use cases already about people wanting to discover content and interact with their friends and businesses reaching people, and all that stuff is getting better with this, too. I guess my point there was it's just there's some lag between the technology becoming available and the products becoming kind of fully explored in the space. And I just think that that was kind of my way of saying that I think that this is just a very exciting area where there's just going to be a lot of innovation for a long time to come.I'll let Susan take a stab at the numbers around the GPUs and all that.\nSusan Li\nThank you. We are clearly in the process of building out a lot of capacity, and Mark has alluded to that in his comments about what we have needed to train prior generations and the next generation of Llama. And that's driving sort of what we've talked about in terms of the significant growth in CapEx in 2025. And we aren't really in the position now to share a longer-term outlook.When we think about sort of any given new data center project that we're constructing, we think about how we will use it over the life of the data center. We think about the amount of capacity we would use in terms of training whatever the subsequent generations of Llama are and architected around that. But then we also look at how we might use it several years into its lifetime towards other use cases across our core business, across what we think might be future needs for inference, for generative AI-based products.So there's sort of a whole host of use cases for the life of any individual data center ranging from gen AI training at its outset to potentially supporting gen AI inference to being used for core ads and content ranking and recommendation and also thinking through the implications, too, of what kinds of servers we might use to support those different types of use cases. So we are really mapping across a wide range of potential use cases when we undertake any given project.And we're really doing that with both a long time horizon in mind, again, because of the long lead times in spinning up data centers, but also recognizing that there are multiple decision points in the lifetime of each data center in terms of thinking through when to order servers and what servers to order and what you'll put them towards. And that gives us flexibility to make the sort of the best decisions based on the information we have in the future.\nKenneth Dorell\nGreat. Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.\n"

        "Text": "By Katie Paul\nNEW YORK - Meta's Llama artificial intelligence models are being used by companies including Goldman Sachs and AT&T for business functions like customer service, document review and computer code generation, the social media giant said in a statement on Thursday.\nThe mostly free-of-charge Llama models have been downloaded almost 350 million times since Meta began releasing them publicly last year, an increase from the 300 million downloads the company announced when it released the biggest version of its latest Llama 3 model in late July.\nUsage via cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure has also increased, more than doubling between May and July this year, Meta said.\nThe announcement comes as Meta and other tech companies plowing billions into AI have faced questions from investors about how widespread adoption of the technology appears to be and what kind of payoff they can expect for their spending.\nMeta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has argued that building state-of-the-art AI models and giving them away for free best positions the company to avoid falling into a position where it is constrained by a competitor's closed technology.\n\"The path for Llama to become the industry standard is by being consistently competitive, efficient, and open generation after generation,\" Zuckerberg wrote last month.\nAlthough large language models like Llama have wowed users with their ability to generate human-like prose on command, they continue to struggle with certain logical tasks and are prone to making factual errors, limiting their adoption in business contexts.\nStill, Meta pointed to a handful of large enterprises dabbling with the Llama models as both evidence of their utility and as an endorsement of their competitiveness with paid alternatives, like models from industry leader OpenAI.\nOther companies it said were using Llama include Japanese bank Nomura Holdings, food delivery service DoorDash and professional services provider Accenture.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Mark Potter)\n"

It also claimed that many AI use cases are \u201cnever going to be cost-efficient, are never going to actually work right, will take up too much energy, or will prove to be untrustworthy.\u201d The fund reportedly said in its letter that AI is in effect software that has failed to deliver \u201cvalue commensurate with the hype\u201d.\nThe $66 billion Elliott Management founded by billionaire Paul Singer, who is one of the most feared activist investors in the US, said there are \u201cfew real uses\u201d of AI other than \u201csummarising notes of meetings, generating reports and helping with computer coding\u201d.\nElliott Management said in its letter that it stayed away from \u201cbubble\u201d stocks included in the Magnificicient Seven group.\nElliott Management last year posted a modest gain of 4.7%. However, it has a record of no down years since the financial crisis in 2008. Since its inception in 1977, the fund has reported just two down years, a feat hard to match in the hedge fund industry.\nWhile Elliott calling mega-cap AI stocks a bubble is a major development, it\u2019s certainly not a surprise. Many investors and market experts have been warning about the hype around major AI stocks.\nHere is what Insider Monkey\u2019s founder and Research Director Inan Dogan said about Elliott Management\u2019s latest thoughts on AI stocks:\n\u201cI have been saying that NVDA\u2019s market cap assumes that the company will make around $150 billion in profits perpetually which is crazy. Elliott is saying the same thing and it is becoming news! Investors don\u2019t know how to bet on the AI revolution, so the only visible companies that they think will benefit are semiconductor and cloud companies. That\u2019s why they have been piling into NVDA. It doesn\u2019t mean that other tech companies are in a bubble territory. In contrast, if Elliott is right that other megacaps are overspending on NVDA chips right now, this implies that their earnings are understated and they are actually much more profitable and cheaper than Elliott thinks. That\u2019s why NVDA and cloud companies are in different categories. NVDA could be in bubble territory but I am not sure other megacaps in the Magnificient Seven group are in a bubble.\u201d\nFor this article, we analyzed the top AI stocks in the Mag. 7 group which according to Paul Singer are in a bubble. We also talked about three AI/tech stocks that were in Singer\u2019s portfolio, as of the end of the first quarter of this year. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company\u2019s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it\u2019s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year\u2019s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year\u2019s free cash flow.

        "Title": "META, NFLX, or AMZN: Which Growth Stock Is the Best Pick?",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "The Federal Reserve is expected to start cutting interest rates in September. This could increase investors\u2019 focus on growth stocks. Companies in the growth phase invest significantly in their businesses. Consequently, they tend to benefit from lower borrowing costs when interest rates reduce. With this backdrop in mind, we used TipRanks\u2019 Stock Comparison Tool to place Meta Platforms (META), Netflix (NFLX), and Amazon (AMZN) against each other to find the best growth stock, according to Wall Street analysts.\nMeta Platforms shares have rallied about 46% year-to-date. The company\u2019s upbeat second-quarter results and a better-than-anticipated outlook for the third quarter of 2024 reflected strong execution and a solid position in the digital ad market.\nIt is worth noting that Meta Platform\u2019s Q2 earnings per share (EPS) surged 73% to $5.16, driven by 22% revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Remarkably, Q2 operating margin expanded to 38% from 29% in the prior-year quarter, fueled by the company\u2019s streamlining and cost-cutting measures.\nMETA is experiencing the benefits of its significant artificial intelligence (AI) investments. AI is improving recommendations and helping users find better content on Meta Platforms\u2019 apps. The company estimates capital expenditure in the range of $37 billion to $40 billion in 2024 and has cautioned that it expects a significant rise in capex next year to support its AI research and product development initiatives.\nOn August 1, Bank of America Securities analyst Justin Post reiterated a Buy rating on META stock and boosted the price target to $563 from $550. The analyst views Meta as \u201cthe top AI play\u201d in the consumer internet space.\nPost explained that his bullish stance is backed by the company\u2019s leading infrastructure and large language model (LLM) capabilities, solid ad growth driven by core AI, and new multi-year growth prospects in generative AI.\nOverall, Meta Platforms scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys, two Holds, and two Sells. At $549.35, the average META stock price target indicates 6.5% upside potential.\nNetflix reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter of 2024. The company\u2019s revenue grew 16.8%, driven by its crackdown on password sharing and efforts to boost subscribers for the ad-supported tier. Global paid memberships increased 16.5% to about 278 million, with 8.05 million additions in the second quarter. \nStrong top-line growth and robust margins drove more than a 48% rise in the EPS. Despite the upbeat Q2 results, shares fell as the company\u2019s Q2 free cash flow declined to $1.2 billion from $1.3 billion in the prior-year quarter. Moreover, Netflix\u2019s Q3 revenue outlook fell short of expectations.\nLooking ahead, Netflix sees continued growth in its ad-supported plans, as they enable the company to offer lower prices to customers and create an additional profit stream through ad revenues. The streaming giant also continues to strengthen its content base to attract more customers.\nOn August 7, Jefferies analyst James Heaney reaffirmed a Buy rating on Netflix stock with a price target of $780. The analyst believes that the recent pullback offers an attractive opportunity to buy the stock. He sees the possibility of the company raising its prices in the fourth quarter in the U.S.\nMoreover, Heaney believes the combination of an attractive content slate, including Squid Game 2 and NFL Christmas Day games, and price hikes could fuel further adoption of the company\u2019s ad-tier plan.\nWall Street\u2019s Moderate Buy consensus rating on NFLX stock is based on 23 Buys, 12 Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average NFLX stock price target of $704.97 indicates 11.4% upside potential. Shares have risen more than 30% so far this year.\u00a0 \nAmazon shares took a hit after the company\u2019s Q2 revenue missed analysts\u2019 expectations due to sluggish growth in the retail business. In particular, the revenue of AMZN\u2019s North America retail division fell short of expectations due to macro pressures and rising competition.\nAmazon Web Service (AWS), the company\u2019s cloud computing unit, delivered 19% revenue growth in Q2, while advertising revenue increased 20%. Amazon is optimistic about the prospects of its AWS business, as enterprises continue to shift to the cloud and modernize their infrastructure. AWS is also expected to gain from generative AI-led demand.\nIt is interesting to note that while Amazon\u2019s Q2 net sales grew 10%, its EPS jumped 94% year-over-year to $1.26. The bottom line gained from the company\u2019s aggressive cost-efficiency measures and enhanced inventory management.\nLooking ahead, Amazon is making significant capital investments to bolster AWS infrastructure so that it can support the solid demand in generative AI and non-generative AI workloads.\nWhile several analysts lowered their price targets for Amazon stock to reflect the subdued growth in retail business, Maxim analyst Tom Forte increased the price target to $251 from $238 and reiterated a Buy rating on AMZN stock.\nThe analyst noted that while Q2 sales were lower than consensus, the company\u2019s EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin increased 420 basis points, driven by robust expense control and a favorable mix shift to the cloud.\nHe highlighted that AWS\u2019 top-line growth rate accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. Based on AWS\u2019 strength, Forte increased his sales and EBIT estimates for FY24 and FY25.\nAmazon scores a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 41 Buys versus one Hold recommendation. The average AMZN stock price target of $223.58 implies nearly 34% upside potential. Shares have risen about 10% so far this year.\nWhile Wall Street is highly bullish on Meta Platforms and Amazon stocks, it is cautiously optimistic on Netflix. Currently, analysts see higher upside potential in Amazon stock than in the stocks of the other two tech giants.\nAmazon\u2019s cost-cutting measures, its dominant position in e-commerce, the massive opportunities for AWS, and the growing advertising business are expected to drive continued growth for the company. \u00a0\u00a0\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "Meta Platforms Inc. (META): A Good Fast Money Stock To Buy According To Hedge Funds",
        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other fast money stocks.\nAs the financial world grapples with shifting economic indicators and political uncertainty, insights from leading experts offer a crucial perspective on what lies ahead. With inflation showing signs of easing and the Federal Reserve signaling a likely rate cut, the focus now shifts to earnings performance and broader economic trends. Adding to this complexity are political developments, such as the possibility of a Republican sweep.\nThe latest June 2024 inflation report revealed a softer-than-expected outcome, causing varied reactions across major stock indices. Initially, futures surged in response, but have since fluctuated. Currently, the Dow is showing gains, the S&P is up slightly, and the NASDAQ is just below the flatline. Inflation dropped by a tenth of a percent month-over-month, contrary to economists' forecasts of a rise.\nChris Harvey, Head of Equity Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, and Mike Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JPMorgan, shared their perspectives on the current financial situation in an episode of CNBC's Fast Money. Chris Harvey is cautious about the concept of market rotation due to ongoing uncertainties about earnings. While he doesn't oppose rotation, he pointed out that investor confidence is still shaky.\n\"That\u2019s right. We\u2019re not against rotation; we\u2019re just waiting for more clarity. Many investors are uncertain about earnings. Until we see a situation where companies don\u2019t go down on bad news, we won\u2019t be fully convinced about the rotation. We want people to believe that numbers will improve and that things will get better. However, right now, bad news is bad news, and that suggests the rotation may not be sustainable.\"\nIn contrast, Mike Feroli discussed the anticipated rate cuts. He believes that the Fed is likely to lower rates soon due to its more aggressive stance. Feroli suggests that the economy is weaker than some might think, which supports the expectation of rate cuts. He noted that we have probably reached the peak for interest rates and that future attention will shift to earnings performance.\nFeroli also explained why he updated his forecast to September. This change is based on recent CPI data showing significant inflation drops over the past year and a rise in unemployment. He expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, with additional cuts likely on a quarterly basis.\n\"Yes, the rate cuts are coming. The Fed has signaled their intention to cut rates more aggressively than they have in the past. We also believe the economy isn\u2019t as strong as some might think, so we expect rates to come down. I think we\u2019ve already hit the peak for rates. Right now, it\u2019s really about earnings.\"\nHowever, if the labor market weakens further, the pace of these cuts could accelerate. Regarding the potential impact of a Donald Trump presidency and a possible Republican sweep, Feroli highlighted the uncertainties. A Republican sweep could lead to more tax cuts, possibly extending or expanding those from 2017, which might boost growth but also increase deficits.\nAdditionally, trade and immigration policies remain unpredictable. While deregulation might mitigate some negative effects, the overall policy environment is still uncertain. Finally, when asked about the implications of a Republican sweep for bond markets, Feroli expressed concern about the deficit trajectory. Extending all tax cuts, particularly in a more Republican-leaning scenario, could exacerbate the deficit problem.\nIn another episode of Fast Money, Chris Mman, Chief Investment Officer at Lafayette College, discussed the potential timing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, emphasizing that September appears to be a strong possibility. He notes, however, that the Fed will be influenced by upcoming economic reports. Mman also highlights concerns over equity valuations and the potential impact of delayed rate cuts on the labor market.\n\"I believe July should have been on the table based on today\u2019s report. However, the Fed usually prefers to signal their plans in advance. My expectation was that they probably wouldn't preemptively set up for September, but given today\u2019s report, it seems quite likely they will. The Fed might use upcoming meetings and communications to guide the market's expectations.\"\nAs political uncertainties, including the Democratic ticket's spotlight, add to the mix, Mman reassures that the Fed is likely to focus on economic data rather than political pressures. He stresses that while inflation remains a critical issue, the Fed's priority will be managing employment trends to avoid a deeper economic downturn.\n\"Even if inflation accelerates temporarily, it\u2019s unlikely to concern the Fed greatly. Currently, the focus has shifted more to employment reports rather than inflation. If employment were to unexpectedly strengthen, it could reduce the Fed\u2019s incentive to cut rates. Ultimately, the goal is to avoid a severe economic slowdown that would force them into aggressive rate cuts.\"\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we review recent episodes of CNBC's Fast Money, where Fast Money traders highlighted stocks with high growth potential. We tracked each stock mentioned and ranked them based on frequency. From this, we identified the top 7 stocks that were mentioned a lot by Fast Money traders and were widely held by hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\nMeta Platforms Inc.

This large user base creates substantial revenue opportunities through targeted advertising, a key driver of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s financial success. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s investment in the metaverse is a bold move aimed at unlocking new revenue streams.\nThrough its Reality Labs division, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is at the forefront of developing augmented and virtual reality technologies, which have the potential to transform online interactions. Although still in the early stages, these initiatives promise significant long-term growth as the metaverse concept gains traction.\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s strong financial performance this quarter highlights its leadership in the tech industry, driven by the innovative release of Llama 3.1, an open-source AI model. Llama 3.1, known for its better cost performance compared to leading closed models, could be a turning point for open-source AI, much like Linux was in its field. This innovation underscores Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s commitment to open-source development, which the company views as beneficial for developers, its apps, and the global community.\nFinancially, Meta Platforms Inc.

(NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company\u2019s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street\u2019s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta\u2019s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns.\nOverall META ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the best fast money stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "-Facebook owner Meta Platforms struck a deal to buy geothermal power from Sage Geosystems to supply its U.S. data centers, it said on Monday, as it races to build out the infrastructure to support its massive investments in energy-hungry artificial intelligence.\nThe first phase of the 150-megawatt project should be operational by 2027 and \"significantly\" expand the use of geothermal power in the United States, the social media company said. The location has yet to be determined, but the companies said it will be east of the Rocky Mountains.\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nGeothermal power is a renewable energy source that uses the Earth's internal heat to produce electricity and heat water. One-hundred and fifty megawatts is roughly enough electricity to power 38,000 homes.\nMeta's announcement, made as part of a U.S. Department of Energy event on geothermal development, comes as President Joe Biden's administration is asking big technology companies to invest in new clean power generation to cover their surging electricity demand.\nThat surge has been driven by the adoption of technologies like generative AI that require large amounts of electricity to power data centers, a development that could complicate Biden's target of decarbonizing the power sector by 2035 to fight climate change.\nSage, which is based in Houston, is a four-year-old startup developing next-generation technology that it says can be deployed in more locations than traditional geothermal, which requires naturally occurring underground reservoirs of hot water and accounts for 0.4% of U.S. power generation.\nThe company is backed by oil and gas firms Chesapeake Energy and Nabors Industries and venture capital firms Virya and Helium-3 Ventures.\nThe project for Meta would be Sage's largest to date by far. The company said it first validated the technology in the field just two years ago.\nA Meta spokesperson told Reuters the company expected the Sage Geosystems energy to feed the power grid, rather than directly supplying any specific data center.\nMeta has been scrambling to overhaul and build out infrastructure to accommodate its push into generative AI for the last several years, refashioning its data centers to support the types of chips best suited to AI workloads.\nThat AI push has caused the company's expenses to spike. Last month, Meta forecast 2024 capital expenditure would come in between $37 billion and $40 billion, while cautioning that infrastructure costs would continue to be a \"significant driver\" of expense growth in 2025.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York and Nichola Groom in New YorkEditing by Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Title": "Possible Bearish Signals With Meta Platforms Insiders Disposing Stock",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Many Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more beneficial than knowing whether they are selling, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.\nWhile we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, sold US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$473 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$519). We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. We note that the biggest single sale was only 9.3% of Andrew Bosworth's holding.\nIn the last year Meta Platforms insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!\nI will like Meta Platforms better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of undervalued and small cap stocks with considerable, recent, insider buying.\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Meta Platforms. In total, insiders sold US$3.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Meta Platforms insiders own 14% of the company, worth about US$180b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\nInsiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Meta Platforms makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Meta Platforms.\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Reddit Battles Meta and Google Using Ads Based on Topics \u2014 Not Your Data",
        "Author": "  Aisha Counts ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Reddit Inc. spent more than a decade known as the internet\u2019s edgy bulletin board, a site where mostly anonymous users could post memes and share wild opinions on topics ranging from investing advice to Taylor Swift\u2019s love life. It was also a service many advertisers tended to avoid.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTurkey Plans Istanbul Taxi Surge to Tackle Complaints\nIntergenerational Housing Could Help Older Adults Combat Loneliness\nAs Rural Hospitals Shutter Maternity Wards, Urban Ones Follow\nNazi Bunker\u2019s Leafy Makeover Turns Ugly Past Into Urban Eyecatcher\nA Loud Warning From the Past About Living With Cars\nNow, six months into life as a publicly traded company, Reddit is winning over advertisers by showing that it\u2019s different than other internet platforms, which often rely on users\u2019 identities and personal information to target ads. Instead, Reddit is targeting people based on their interests, relying on the site\u2019s deeply detailed communities \u2014 called subreddits \u2014 to match advertisers with potential customers.\nUnlike many of its much larger advertising competitors, including Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., Reddit has mostly anonymous users. That means the company can\u2019t always rely on personal information like gender or location to serve the ideal ad to the ideal customer.\nBut users who don\u2019t identify themselves tend to be more open and honest with their posts and their interests, said Jen Wong, Reddit\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cWhen people come to Reddit, they reveal things about themselves that they would not reveal on other platforms,\u201d said Wong, who joined Reddit in 2018 after holding the same title at Time Inc.\nThe site\u2019s themed discussion forums give Reddit a chance to precisely align advertisers with those interests. That might mean adding a financial services ad in a group about investing, or a car ad promoting extra cargo space in a forum about camping. Reddit has more than 100,000 such communities organized around topics ranging from skin care to parenting tips, and more than 90 million people visit the site each day.\nReddit\u2019s executives are hoping that contextual- or interest-based advertising, as the approach is called, will set the site apart in a crowded digital advertising industry dominated by Meta and Google. Early returns on that strategy have been promising. The text-based site easily surpassed expectations in its first two earnings reports this year, disclosing strong sales and better-than-expected projected growth. The stock is up 66% from its $34 initial public offering price in March.\nBeyond targeting subreddits, the company also can use specific keywords to sell what it calls conversation ads. If a Redditor in r/HydroHomies \u2014 a community about the benefits of drinking water that has more than 1.2 million users \u2014 asks for advice about a specific brand of water bottle, an ad for that exact product could appear next to that user\u2019s post. These conversation ads are the fastest-growing ad format on the platform, the company said.\nThey also give marketers a chance to appear in subreddits where customers are already talking about them. \u201cWe want to engage with our community where there is already traction,\u201d said Aaron Jones, vice president of e-commerce and media for Liquid I.V., a Unilever Plc brand that makes powdered drink mixes and has been advertising on Reddit since 2021.\nSelling advertisers on this interest-based approach can be a challenge since targeting based on a user\u2019s identity has become expected on so many other digital platforms. While Reddit can use some people\u2019s gender and location for ad targeting, users don\u2019t have to share those details, though Reddit can still infer a user\u2019s general location using their IP address.\nThat is a constraint with advertisers, Wong acknowledged. \u201cSo much of the digital economy for a long time was based on demographics and profiling.\u201d\nThe platform\u2019s colorful history can also complicate its pitch to marketers. Redditors are known for being rowdy, free-spirited and unafraid to speak their minds. The site\u2019s users have openly revolted against prior executives, taken their subreddits offline over unwanted policy changes and threatened to bet against Reddit\u2019s own IPO. For years, the site also had a reputation as the wild west of the internet. Reddit\u2019s forums were known for hosting a maelstrom of unsavory content, such as racism or nonconsensual sexual images, that kept advertisers and investors at bay.\nMarketers are often hesitant to buy ads if those messages could end up next to something distasteful. The social network X, for example, saw its advertising revenue decline close to 50% after Elon Musk purchased the site and cut back on content moderation practices, which spooked image-conscious brands.\nBut those passionate users can also bring a benefit. \u201cYou can actually reach people that no other channel can reach,\u201d said Jack Johnston, senior social innovation director at performance marketing agency Tinuiti, which buys ads on Meta, Pinterest, X and Reddit. He pointed out that an estimated 52% of people on Reddit are not on X, for example.\nDespite being around for close to 20 years, Reddit only started investing heavily in its advertising business in 2018, and is now hoping that marketers and investors are ready to acknowledge the site has grown up. Executives often point to its unique form of content moderation as proof that it\u2019s a safer place for brands than other sites. Reddit largely relies on a group of more than 60,000 human moderators \u2014 users who volunteer to serve as a sort of content police \u2014 to flag or take down unsavory content. On top of that, the site has a voting system so users can rate the quality of content.\n\u201cFrom everything we\u2019re seeing, they have a level of brand safety and content safety for advertisers that is very comparable to most other social platforms,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t necessarily the case a couple years ago.\u201d\nThose improvements have paid dividends. Reddit recently signed new content partnerships with major sports leagues, including the NFL, NBA and MLB, and the majority of Reddit\u2019s advertising revenue comes from Fortune 500 companies. Last year, the site made close to $800 million in ad sales, and counts marquee brands like Toyota, Disney, Samsung and Ulta Beauty among its advertisers.\nThis year, analysts expect Reddit\u2019s overall advertising business to eclipse $1.1 billion in revenue and see the company reaching $2 billion in sales as soon as 2027, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. To get there, Reddit will need to court smaller marketers, too. The company makes more than 25% of its revenue from just 10 advertisers, meaning any unexpected pullback from a key partner could have a significant impact on the company\u2019s business, said Dan Salmon, lead analyst at New Street Research. \u201cThis army of small businesses \u2014 that\u2019s the most important thing for all of those platforms, for Reddit, for Pinterest, for X,\u201d he said.\nReddit\u2019s pitch to smaller advertisers, which include Cotopaxi, Mint Mobile and DraftKings, is that they can find entire communities of people passionate about their area of business. Advertisers large and small say they\u2019re already planning to spend more on Reddit in the coming quarters.\n\u201cWe are seeing investment grow pretty substantially in Reddit,\u201d said Tinuiti\u2019s Johnston. During the first half of the year, Tinuiti\u2019s clients spent more than three times as much money on Reddit ads than they did a year ago, he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re organized into these 100,000 communities that are all niche interests,\u201d Reddit\u2019s Wong said. \u201cSo for each one of them, there is a segment of advertiser that we know matches to those communities.\u201d\n(Updates with total users in fifth paragraph and more on ad targeting in ninth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Rent Controls Are Deepening the Dutch Housing Crisis\nHong Kong\u2019s Old Airport Becomes Symbol of City\u2019s Property Pain\nFar-Right \u2018Terrorgram\u2019 Chatrooms Are Fueling a Wave of Power Grid Attacks\nUS Tech Is Holding Back Some AI Products From Europe\nLosing Your Job Used to Be Shameful.

        "Text": "It\u2019s not often staffers at the likes of Meta and Google are looking enviously at the lifestyle of others, but the going is so good at Nvidia that it\u2019s making Big Tech peers a little green.\nEmployees of the tech world have been discussing the compensation packages at the Jensen Huang\u2013led firm versus the likes of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta and Sundar Pichai\u2013led Google.\nOn Blind\u2014an anonymous forum for professionals in the software and tech space\u2014a user who says they formerly worked at Google asked Nvidia employees: \u201cHow rich are you?\u201d\nOne apparent Nvidia employee, who stated their net worth was around $3 million, responded that the wealth of employees \u201creally depends on your level.\u201d\nThe individual added they still have $3 million in assets left to vest and were \u201cvery comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cBought a $100K family car in all cash and didn\u2019t have to think about it,\u201d the post continued. \u201cThanks JHH [Jen-Hsun Huang].\u201d\nThe individual\u2014who said the car they purchased was a \u201cdecked out\u201d BMW X7\u2014added they had been promoted within the past year to an Ic6, a principal engineer.\nAnother user whose profile states they work for Snap wrote: \u201cWife and I are worth $14.8M at 32, none of us work at NVDA, but we live in the Bay Area and have some old-timer friends there.\n\u201cEvery single one of them is worth over $25M. It\u2019s nuts.\u201d\nAnother user whose profile shows they work for Meta chimed in: \u201cThe more I hear about Nvidia employees and their riches, the more jealous I feel. Anybody with me?\u201d\nMeta and Google did not immediately respond to Fortune's approach for comment.\nThe ballooning wealth of Nvidia employees is thanks to the rocketing share price of the company, and the organization\u2019s now famously attractive stock incentives.\nThrough Nvidia\u2019s employee stock purchase plan, staff can contribute up to 15% of their salary to buy company shares at a 15% discount.\nThis has led to notable examples, such as one mid-level employee who bought in for 18 years reportedly retiring with shares worth $62 million, according to Barron\u2019s senior technology writer Tae Kim.\nNvidia\u2019s shares have ballooned over the past few years in particular, leading to a corresponding spike in the net worth of shareholders like employees and CEO Huang.\nIn October 2022, Nvidia was trading at around $14 a share; today, it has risen to almost $130 a share.\nHuang\u2019s net worth, which is largely tied up in the chipmaking giant, has also experienced a boost: In October 2022 Huang was worth a little over $11 billion, at the time of writing, his fortune is valued at $112 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making him the 12th richest person on the planet.\nHis 3.8% stake in the company is so significant that he can afford to off-load hundreds of thousands of shares on a near-daily basis, worth an average of $14M a sale, without its having a massive impact on either the market or his stake.\nNvidia did not immediately respond to Fortune's approach for comment.\nWith millionaire status on the line for Nvidia employees, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that a lot is expected of them at work.\nIn an interview with 60 Minutes released this spring, Huang was told some of the words his team used to describe him, including \u201cdemanding,\u201d \u201cperfectionist,\u201d and \u201cnot easy to work for.\u201d\nHuang said those descriptors fit him \u201cperfectly,\u201d explaining: \u201cIt should be like that. If you want to do extraordinary things, it shouldn\u2019t be easy.\u201d\nStaffers at the Santa Clara, Calif.\u2013based business seemed happy with their work-life balance.\nWriting on Blind, another user whose profile says they work for Nvidia added the experience of working at the company \u201cdepends on the team.\u201d\nThey explained: \u201cI work 10 a.m. [to] 5 p.m. on weekdays and per week one or two nighttime meetings due to overseas collaborations.\n\u201cAnd people can WFH all days in a week, some of my teammates do.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Meta, which develops one of the biggest foundational open source large language models, Llama, believes it will need significantly more computing power to train models in the future.\nMark Zuckerberg said on Meta's second-quarter earnings call on Tuesday that to train Llama 4, the company will need 10x more compute than what was needed to train Llama 3. But he still wants Meta to build capacity to train models rather than fall behind its competitors.\n\u201cThe amount of computing needed to train Llama 4 will likely be almost 10 times more than what we used to train Llama 3, and future models will continue to grow beyond that,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\"It's hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future. But at this point, I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new inference projects.\"\nMeta released Llama 3 with 8 billion parameters in April. The company last week released an upgraded version of the model, called Llama 3.1 405B, which had 405 billion parameters, making it Meta's biggest open source model.\nMeta's CFO, Susan Li, also said the company is thinking about different data center projects and building capacity to train future AI models. She said Meta expects this investment to increase capital expenditures in 2025.\nTraining large language models can be a costly business. Meta's capital expenditures rose nearly 33% to $8.5 billion in Q2 2024, from $6.4 billion a year earlier, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure.\nAccording to a report from The Information, OpenAI spends $3 billion on training models and an additional $4 billion on renting servers at a discount rate from Microsoft.\n\"As we scale generative AI training capacity to advance our foundation models, we\u2019ll continue to build our infrastructure in a way that provides us with flexibility in how we use it over time. This will allow us to direct training capacity to GenAI inference or to our core ranking and recommendation work, when we expect that doing so would be more valuable,\" Li said during the call.\nDuring the call, Meta also talked about its consumer-facing Meta AI's usage and said India is the largest market of its chatbot. But Li noted that the company doesn't expect Gen AI products to contribute to revenue in a significant way.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/01/zuckerberg-says-meta-will-need-10x-more-computing-power-to-train-llama-4-than-llama-3/\n"

Meta allows policy-violating content to be visible if it is newsworthy, or in the public interest.\nTurkey ranks fifth in the world in terms of Instagram usage, with more than 57 million users, following India, the United States, Brazil and Indonesia, according to data platform Statista.\n(Reporting by Ezgi Erkoyun;Editing by Daren Butler and Sharon Singleton)\n"

It is dated August 26, 2024.\n\"I believe the government pressure was wrong,\" adds Zuckerberg, adding that he regrets not being more outspoken about it.\nDuring the pandemic, Facebook implemented misinformation alerts for users who commented on or liked posts that were judged to contain false Covid information.\nIn addition, posts criticizing Covid vaccines were also deleted. In the 2020 US presidential election campaign, President Biden said social media platforms were \"killing people\" for allowing what they deemed as misinformation about coronavirus vaccines to be posted on the platforms.\n\"I think we made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn't make today,\" added Zuckerberg. \"I feel strongly that we should not compromise our content standards due to pressure from any administration in either direction.

        "Text": "AI this, AI that.\nWe\u2019ve heard it all from companies in their quarterly releases about the technology, with some seemingly shoving the term into their commentaries as a buzzword. But the obvious question remains \u2013 is anybody actually benefiting?\nThe answer is yes.\nSeveral companies, including Palantir PLTR and Meta Platforms META, are actually reaping the benefits of AI, as reflected by their quarterly results. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each.\nPalantir\u2019s quarterly release was filled with positivity, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations. Revenue soared 27% year-over-year, whereas EPS climbed 200%. The company builds software that empowers organizations to effectively integrate their data, decisions, and operations.\nThe company\u2019s platform continues to be highly attractive, reflected by 41% year-over-year customer growth. Impressively, PLTR closed over 27 deals worth $10 million throughout the period, further reflecting the snowballing demand.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThough strength was broad, the company\u2019s US commercial sales were notably bright, growing 55% year-over-year alongside an 83% customer increase. The CEO delivered a notably bullish statement following the print, stating \u2013\n\u2018In Q2 2024, we generated $159 million in revenue in the U.S. commercial market alone, an increase of 55% from the same period the year before. The growth rate was even more significant, at 70% year-over-year, when excluding strategic commercial contracts. And the persistent and unbridled demand for our software, for an effective enterprise platform that makes artificial intelligence capabilities useful to large institutions, shows no sign of relenting.\u2019\nAnalysts have adjusted their current year sales expectations accordingly following the robust release, with the now $2.8 billion expected suggesting a 21% jump.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe stock remains a prime selection for those seeking AI exposure, further reinforced by its favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\nMega-cap giant Meta Platforms was one of the few Mag 7 members to see a positive reaction to its quarterly results, with the company again exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations. The stock remains a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook reflecting bullishness across the board.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe company delivered a stunning statement in the release, with Mark Zuckerberg saying, \u2018We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,\" \nHe continued, \"We've released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see\u00a0good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we're driving good growth across our apps.\" \nMeta also raised its CapEx outlook into a band of $37 - $40 billion ($35 - $40 billion prior) to support its artificial intelligence roadmap.\nThe valuation picture for META remains attractive, with the current 21.5X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 31.5X. In addition, the current PEG ratio works out to 1.1X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile companies continue to seemingly throw around the AI buzzword in their quarterly releases, several, including Palantir PLTR and Meta Platforms META, are actually benefitting from AI, with the trends expected to continue.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "By Aditya Soni and Reshma Rockie George\n(Reuters) - Meta soared nearly 9% on Thursday after its rosy revenue growth signaled that strong digital-ad spending on its social media platforms can cover the cost of its AI investments.\nThe parent company of Facebook was on track to add about $120 billion to its market value of $1.204 trillion, after it topped second-quarter revenue expectations and forecast growth for the July-September period that was above Wall Street's estimates.\nIts results were another positive sign for the digital ad market after upbeat earnings from search giant Google pushed up shares of smaller rivals such as Snap and Reddit by 2.7% and 4.4%, respectively.\nThe Snapchat parent is scheduled to report earnings after market close on Thursday.\nAnalysts said the strong report gave Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg more time to prove that the billions of dollars the company was plowing into AI would pay off. Even though the company's costs jumped 7% in the second quarter, its strong revenue growth drove a 9-point rise in operating margin to 38%.\n\"Underneath a cloud of tougher comparisons, a tougher macro, and mixed peer commentary, Meta continues to look like the best place to deploy digital ad dollars on the planet,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said.\n\"2025 capex will certainly be much higher, though whether it outgrows revenue next year remains an open question. Core AI has great return on investment, generative AI should have great return on investment,\" he added.\nChief Financial Officer Susan Li said on Wednesday that Meta was reaping the fruits of a multi-year project to use AI to improve targeting, ranking and delivery systems for digital ads on its platforms.\nMeta expects capital expenditure between $37 billion and $40 billion in 2024. Its spending surge mirrors forecasts from fellow tech industry powerhouses that are investing heavily in AI to capitalize on the booming technology.\n\"GenAI will require significant infrastructure investments to train the next generation of large foundational models and Meta is getting ahead of a multi-year capacity ramp,\" J.P.Morgan analysts said.\nMeta's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio stands at 21.1, compared with Alphabet's 20.6 and Microsoft's 31, according to LSEG data.

        "Title": "The Best of the Magnificent 7 (NVDA, META, AMZN)",
        "Author": "  Ethan Feller ",
        "Text": "Last week the market experienced its sharpest correction of the year, with the VIX index shooting above 60 and the broad market falling more than 10% in just a few weeks. But the buying impulse has been even more surprising as the V-shaped recovery has caught many investors off guard.\nIn hindsight, it seems that the intense selling seen last Monday may have been a one-off event, with unwind of the Japanese carry trade causing a capitulation among the most levered traders. Even though stocks have rapidly appreciated from last week\u2019s lows, many are still on sale, most notably stocks from the Magnificent 7, which make up the largest and some of the best performing in the market.\nLooking back to last week\u2019s lows, we can see which of the group has rallied the most. Relative strength is one of my favorite ways to find winning stocks as it often points to those with the most momentum and investor interest. Nvidia (NVDA), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) have seen the fastest gains since the lows, leading me to believe they may continue to lead the Mag 7 and the broad market.\nImage Source: TradingView\nIt can be hard to buy stocks right after they have run up, but history tells us that strength often begets more strength. However, markets don\u2019t move in a straight line and if it is difficult to pull the trigger on these stocks, there is nothing wrong for waiting on a pullback. But when the pullback does eventually come, you must have the courage to execute the plan.\nBut how can investors be confident when buying pullbacks? If you take inventory of the broader picture, the economy and stock market should be conducive for the foreseeable future, giving investors security when buying. The economy is growing above trend and remained robust throughout the Fed raising cycle, earnings are growing nicely, and we can expect lower interest rates in the near future. With lower interest rates, we can expect the economy to begin expanding again, which should encourage profit growth at corporations and even some multiple expansion in stock valuations.\nIf we look at the seasonality chart, we can see that there may be some weakness in stocks in the second half of September into October. Additionally, with the US presidential election looming this fall, there may be some additional pangs of uncertainty, possibly adding to any temporary selloffs.\nThus, if we don\u2019t get any pullbacks over the next week or two, investors can remain patient as there should be more buying opportunities before the year end.\nImage Source: EquityClcck\n\u00a0\nSo, we covered why investors can be confident that the broad market should hold up, but what about Nvidia, Amazon and Meta Platforms are still so appealing as investments? More than anything, these companies are growing profits at truly incredible rates, especially for their immense size.\nAlthough each of these companies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting flat earnings revisions trends, the earnings growth forecasts are more than reason enough to consider buying. Earnings per share (EPS) are projected to grow 37.6% annually at Nvidia, 27.4% annually at Amazon and 19% annually at Meta Platforms over the next three to five years. While not a perfect comparison, stocks typically appreciate in line with their earnings growth over the long term, which could translate to impressive price gains for these companies.\nThese companies sit directly in the front seat of the most important secular business and technology trends, which is why they expect such impressive growth. From Artificial Intelligence, to cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital communities, they will be the leaders in these high growth high profit businesses.\nFurthermore, they all have fairly reasonable valuations, especially compared to historical averages. Meta platforms is trading at 25.3x, right in line with its 10-year median, Amazon is trading at 36.7x, well below its 10-year median of 93.6x and Nvidia is trading at 48.5x, just above its 10-year median of 42.7x.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile the recent market recovery has been swift and robust, it's crucial to remember that the market can be unpredictable. Although the economic environment and earnings growth for companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms remain favorable, markets don't move in a straight line. There could be pullbacks, especially with seasonal trends and the upcoming election adding potential volatility.\nHowever, when these pullbacks occur, they should be seen as opportunities for disciplined investors to enter or add to positions in high-quality stocks. Always prioritize risk management and ensure that your investment decisions align with your long-term goals, as the market will do what it wants, regardless of expectations.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Meta Platforms is hardly the only big tech company with no plans to put the brakes on its blowout artificial-intelligence spending. It might be the only one where that news was already priced in.\nThe parent company of Facebook and Instagram used its second-quarter report on Wednesday to announce plans to make between $37 billion and $40 billion in capital expenditures this year. That is up from the prior range of $35 billion to $40 billion that the company gave three months ago\u2014essentially a 3% raise at the midpoint.\nIntel to Cut Jobs and Suspend Dividend in Cost-Saving Push\nAmazon Shares Slide as Spending Surges and Revenue Outlook Disappoints\nApple\u2019s iPhone Sales Slide, but Investors Still Expect AI Rally\nAfter Years of Raising Prices, Food Companies Hit Consumers\u2019 Limits\nWeak Economic Data Prompts Stock Selloff\nEither one is a tidy sum given Meta\u2019s size\u2014at least relative to its other megacap tech peers. An outlay of $37 billion would represent 23% of what Wall Street projects for Meta\u2019s total revenue this year. Amazon.com, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet are projected to devote between 10% and 20% of their revenue to capex over the same period, according to consensus estimates from FactSet. And for good measure, Meta also said Wednesday that it expects \u201csignificant capital expenditures growth\u201d in 2025. Three months ago the company simply said capex \u201cwill continue to increase\u201d in the next year.\nIt was basically the same message on that front that Microsoft and Google broadcast in their recent reports. But Meta\u2019s stock jumped more than 7% in after-hours trading following its Wednesday afternoon release, compared with respective drops of 1% and 5% for Microsoft and Alphabet following their results. Meta\u2019s revenue beat Wall Street\u2019s consensus estimate by a slightly wider margin than those other two. It also helps that the stock had already experienced sticker shock from AI spending plans broadcast in the last earnings season. Meta is the only one of the six trillion-dollar tech megacaps to have seen its shares lose ground between its March quarter report and the latest one.\nMeta\u2019s turbulent record over the past few years shows that its investors are willing to roll with expensive ambitions as long as the core business holds up and other costs are held down. That is proving to be the case now. Advertising revenue grew 22% year over year to $38.3 billion, which was $3 billion higher than what Wall Street expected. Operating income of $14.8 billion also beat analysts\u2019 estimates, despite a loss of nearly $4.5 billion in the Reality Labs division that houses the company\u2019s VR and metaverse efforts.\nThe company is also keeping to the lessons of its \u201cyear of efficiency.\u201d Head count grew by 1,470 in the June period, but remains 19% below the company\u2019s peak in late 2022. Revenue per employee is up 51% from that time.\nStill, investors are getting antsier about the expensive race to build generative-AI services. It is a boon for Nvidia: The AI chip star\u2019s stock jumped more than 3% in after-hours trading Wednesday following Meta\u2019s results after surging nearly 13% in the regular session following Microsoft\u2019s report. Capex questions from analysts dominated both earnings calls, and Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg maintained his previously stated view that Meta\u2019s direct payoff from genAI services isn\u2019t close at hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anyone should be surprised that I would expect that that will be years,\u201d he said on Wednesday\u2019s call.\nYears are something the 40-year-old centibillionaire has. And years it might take, given the still tight supply of Nvidia\u2019s most powerful chips. Zuckerberg showed up on stage with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at a conference on Monday, with the two joking about the 600,000 GPU chips Meta has already bought from the company.\nHuang is laughing all the way to the bank now. Zuckerberg eventually needs to ensure that his company\u2019s AI spending doesn\u2019t become a punchline.\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com\nDon Lemon Sues Elon Musk and X for Canceling Partnership Deal\nVenu Sports Streaming Service to Cost $42.99 a Month\nNike Paid Him to Make Gold-Dipped Sneakers for LeBron.

Meta\u2019s investigators linked the activity to the same network blamed for the hacking incident reported by Trump\u2019s campaign.\nThe FBI this week said a hack by Iran of the Trump campaign and an attempted breach of the Biden-Harris campaign was part of a broader Iranian effort to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.\nA statement Friday from Meta, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, said that the hackers had tried to target the WhatsApp accounts of individuals in the Middle East, the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as political and diplomatic officials \u2014 including unidentified officials associated with the Trump and Biden administrations. A \u201csmall cluster\u201d of accounts was blocked by Meta, the company said.\n\u201cWe have not seen evidence of the targeted WhatsApp accounts being compromised, but out of an abundance of caution, we\u2019re sharing our findings publicly, in addition to sharing information with law enforcement and our industry peers,\u201d Meta said in a statement.\nIn a report this month, Google's threat intelligence arm said the same Iranian group, which it linked to the country's Revolutionary Guard, had tried to infiltrate the personal email accounts of roughly a dozen people linked to Biden and Trump since May. That report expanded on a separate study released days earlier by Microsoft that revealed suspected Iranian cyber intrusion in this year\u2019s presidential election.\nU.S. intelligence officials say Iran\u2019s increasingly aggressive use of cyberattacks and disinformation has several motives: to confuse and polarize voters in an effort to undermine confidence in U.S. democracy, to erode support for Israel, and to oppose candidates that it believes will increase tension between Washington and Iran.\nIran has vowed revenge against Trump, whose administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of an Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.\nIn July, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said Iran\u2019s government gave covert support to American protests against Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza. Groups linked to Iran posed as online activists, encouraged campus protests and provided financial support to some protest groups, Haines said.\nMessages left with the Trump and Harris campaigns were not immediately returned Friday.\n"

Zuckerberg has said publicly that he would not endorse any candidate for President, and has avoided making public endorsements for the last several elections. He did, though, call Trump\u2019s reaction to the assassination attempt \u201cbadass\u201d during an interview with Bloomberg in mid-July.\nTrump said that Zuckerberg called him again this week to apologize over how a photo of the assassination attempt was handled by Meta\u2019s automated moderation systems. A photo of Trump with his fist raised in the air was incorrectly appended with a fact-check label this week after other versions of that photo had been manipulated to show the Secret Service agents next to him smiling.

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has billions of active users across all of its platforms. Between WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger, it has a huge user base that it can test new products and services on. Its Threads platform grew to over 100 million users in less than five days after launching last year, largely due to it being incredibly easy for Instagram users to try it out.\nThe company looks to be leveraging its users once again to help it jump on the next big bandwagon: artificial intelligence (AI). CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees it as a huge opportunity, and while Meta may be a bit late to the game, it has some ambitious targets ahead. And if it achieves them, that could make an already hot stock even better.\nArtificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT has been publicly available since November 2022 and it has ignited a lot of excitement around AI and how it can transform how people do tasks and potentially even eliminate the need for certain jobs. There are reportedly 200 million monthly active users on ChatGPT. But Zuckerberg thinks Meta's AI can surpass that -- before the end of the year.\nMeta recently released a new AI model, Llama 3.1, which it says performs better than the latest GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on multiple benchmarks. The model is open-source -- meaning anyone can see and update the code -- which could attract many developers and potentially help make the model better over time. The AI will be integrated within the company's applications and even virtual reality headsets, making it easy for Meta's vast user base to gain exposure to it and potentially become regular users. \nGiven the billions of users Meta's applications have, surpassing ChatGPT in number of users may not be all that difficult, even if the goal is for that to happen before the end of the year.\nI wouldn't be surprised if Meta can get a lot of people to use its AI platform, especially if it's easily accessible within WhatsApp, Facebook, and other popular applications. The real test, however, will be how long people use it for, and whether it will lure them away from ChatGPT. While people may accidentally click a button to launch the Meta AI or just test it out to see what it does, and that will surely bump up the user count, for it to really be a significant game changer for the business, it will need to show that it's better than ChatGPT or that it can at least be a viable alternative. That could take a bit longer to prove.\nIf that happens and users do indeed see value in Meta's chatbot, the company could find ways to monetize the product. ChatGPT, for instance, offers a subscription service to a more advanced version of its chatbot. Microsoft's Copilot is available within its Office software for an additional subscription price as well. \nPlus, if Meta's AI can enhance the user experience within its existing applications, leading to greater usage and more users overall, that could also draw in more advertising dollars.\nMeta has already been growing at an impressive rate and an AI boost could generate even more bullishness around the stock. For the three-month period ending June 30, Meta's sales grew by 22% to $39 billion. And its net income rose by 73% to $13.5 billion. Not only did the average price per ad increase by 10% during the quarter, but the number of ad impressions across its family of apps also rose at a similar rate. The stock is up about 40% so far this year. \nMeta's business has been doing well, but I would hold off on buying the stock until it can prove that its new AI assistant can truly be the success that Zuckerberg envisions. There are a lot of big tech companies launching their own chatbots and it may not be easy to lure users away from one onto another. \nIf Meta's AI does prove it can win over users, however, then it could make the tech stock a no-brainer buy as it could accelerate the company's already strong growth rate. \nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company tweaked its full-year projections for capital expenditures, setting a new forecast of $37 billion to $40 billion, raising the low end of an earlier range by $2 billion.\nMeta recently unveiled its largest model to date, which Zuckerberg said cost hundreds of millions of dollars in computing power to train. The company has also spent heavily on other long-term projects, including AI-powered smartglasses and a series of virtual worlds known as the metaverse. Reality Labs, the division within Meta tasked with building these futuristic technologies, reported a loss of nearly $4.5 billion on the quarter.\nBalancing investment with the more immediate need for financial returns has been a challenge at times for Meta. Zuckerberg has made moves to support Meta\u2019s stock performance \u2014 including job cuts, a $50 billion share buyback program and Meta\u2019s first-ever quarterly dividend \u2014 while remaining clear that the company\u2019s spending will continue to rise. The company said in a release Wednesday that it plans to increase capital expenditures \u201csignificantly\u201d as it invests in AI research and product development.\nThere are some early signs that the AI-focused products are gaining popularity, though not necessarily contributing to the company\u2019s bottom line. Zuckerberg said that the Meta AI chatbot is on pace to become the most widely used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year. Eventually, he said, he believes that every business will need one \u2014 if not multiple \u2014 AI-powered chatbots to handle customer service queries and interactions.\nRecent earnings reports from Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. showed that some investors are losing patience with the significant outlays on AI infrastructure that haven\u2019t brought commensurate commercial benefits.\nDemand for Meta\u2019s smart glasses, which are built via a partnership with EssilorLuxottica\u2019s Ray-Ban, is outpacing the company\u2019s ability to build them, he said.\nZuckerberg said in April that \u201csmart investors\u201d would see the long-term promises of artificial intelligence and metaverse technology, even if the financial returns are years away. Earlier this month, he told Bloomberg investing too much would be better than investing too little.\nWatch: Inside Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Era (Video)\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s a meaningful chance that a lot of the companies are over-building now, and that you\u2019ll look back and you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, we maybe all spent some number of billions of dollars more than we had to,\u2019\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cOn the flip side, I actually think all the companies that are investing are making a rational decision, because the downside of being behind is that you\u2019re out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years.\u201d\nThrough Wednesday, Meta shares had risen 34% this year.\n(Updates share price.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 14, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Arista Networks, Inc. ANET, NetApp, Inc. NTAP and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA.\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nLast week, Wall Street witnessed one of the most eventful weeks in 2024. Markets were rattled on Aug 5, following the release of disappointing July payrolls data, reigniting fears that the economy might slip into a recession.\nHowever, stocks have recovered most of the losses since then in a dramatic rebound that has greatly fizzled fears of a recession in the near term, following the release of a fresh jobless claims report that came in better than expected. However, the market volatility is far from over.\nOn Aug 5, the Dow gave up more than 1,000 points, while the S&P 500 finished 3% lower to record its worst day since 2022. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged 3.4%. The massive selloff was sparked by fears that the Fed may have held interest rates higher for too long, which has started taking its toll on the economy.\nTech stocks, which were so long driving the market rally, were the worst suffers of last week's market rout, with $1.5 billion of market capitalization being wiped out of the \"magnificent 7\" stocks.\nHowever, markets have since made a solid rebound. On Aug 8, all three major indexes rallied, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq jumping 2.3% and 2.9%, respectively. The S&P recorded its best close since November 2022.\nOnce again, the rally was driven by tech stocks. Markets closed the week on a high, recovering nearly all the earlier losses. However, the volatility is far from over as the Federal Reserve said that it will closely monitor inflation data before going ahead with the rate cuts.\nInflation has declined sharply over the past couple of months and investors are now awaiting the key consumer price index (CPI) reading for July.\nThe Federal Reserve is gearing up for its rate cuts, with markets pricing in a 25-50 basis point rate cut in September, followed by two more rate cuts by the end of this year.\nLower interest rates typically help growth stocks, particularly tech stocks. Given this situation, it would be a wise decision to buy stocks at a bargain.\nWe have chosen four top-ranked tech stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc., Arista Networks, Inc., NetApp, Inc. and NVIDIA Corp. that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days. Each of the stocks has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. is the world's largest social media platform. META's portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like the photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions.\nMeta Platforms' expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 42.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 3.5% over the past 60 days. META currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\nArista Networks, Inc. is engaged in providing cloud networking solutions for data centers and cloud computing environments. ANET offers 10/25/40/50/100 Gigabit Ethernet switches and routers optimized for the next-generation data center networks. Arista uses multiple silicon architectures across its products.\nArista Networks' expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 18.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 4% over the past 60 days. ANET presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\nNetApp, Inc. provides enterprise storage as well as data management software and hardware products and services. NTAP assists enterprises in managing multiple clouds environments, adopting next-generation technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), Kubernetes, and contemporary databases, and navigating the complexity brought about by the quick development of data and cloud usage.\nNetApp's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 6.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings improved 0.6% over the past 60 days. NTAP presently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\nNVIDIA Corp. is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA's focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that now support high-performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\nNVIDIA Corporation's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is more than 100%.

        "Author": "  Jonathan Stempel ",
        "Text": "By Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) -Meta Platforms defeated an appeal by Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group founded by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., challenging its censorship of Facebook posts that spread misinformation about vaccines' efficacy and safety.\nIn a decision on Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California, said the nonprofit did not show that Meta worked with or was coerced by federal officials to suppress views challenging \"government orthodoxy\" on vaccines.\nChildren's Health Defense sued in 2020, saying that Meta had violated its constitutional rights by flagging \"vaccine misinformation\" as false, and taking away its right to advertise on Facebook.\nMeta's actions included prohibiting users from sharing claims that COVID-19 vaccines don't work, and referring viewers of Children's Health Defense posts to the World Health Organization for facts about COVID-19.\nCircuit Judge Eric Miller, appointed to the court by Republican former President Donald Trump, wrote for the appeals court that Meta was a \"purely private\" company with a First Amendment right not to use its platform to promote views it found distasteful.\n\"Meta evidently believes that vaccines are safe and effective and that their use should be encouraged,\" Miller wrote. \"It does not lose the right to promote those views simply because they happen to be shared by the government.\"\nThe court also rejected Children's Health Defense's claims against the Poynter Institute and Science Feedback, which help Meta evaluate the accuracy of Facebook content.\nKennedy, an independent U.S. presidential candidate, helped argue Children's Health Defense's appeal. Meta removed the group's accounts from Facebook and Instagram in August 2022.\nChildren's Health Defense said it was disappointed with the decision and considering its legal options.\nIts general counsel Kim Mack Rosenberg said the First Amendment \"seems hollow\" when the only speech protected and heard \"reinforces the prevailing narrative.\"\nMeta and lawyers for the Menlo Park, California-based company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nCircuit Judge Daniel Collins, also a Trump appointee, dissented from the decision, saying Children's Health Defense could seek an injunction on its free speech claims. He agreed that its other claims, including for monetary damages, should be dismissed.\nFriday's decision upheld a June 2021 ruling by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco.\nThe case is Children's Health Defense v Meta Platforms Inc, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-16210.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler and Shri Navaratnam)\n"

        "Author": "  Eleanor Pringle ",
        "Text": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has washed his hands of this year\u2019s U.S. presidential elections\u2014and has vowed not to accommodate any demands from current or future administrations.\nA letter written by the Facebook founder to Republican Rep. Jim Jordan alleges White House representatives \u201crepeatedly pressured\u201d Meta into censoring COVID content and \u201cexpressed a lot of frustration\u201d when the Meta team would not comply. \nThe letter, dated Aug. 26, was shared on the official X page of the House Judiciary GOP; Jordan is the House Judiciary Committee chairman.\nIn the letter Zuckerberg, who has amassed a fortune worth $185 billion per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, says he regrets bowing to the alleged pressure from the Biden administration during the pandemic.\nThe entrepreneur wrote: \u201cUltimately, it was our decision whether or not to take content down, and we own our decisions, including COVID-19-related changes we made to our enforcement in the wake of this pressure.\n\u201cI believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it.\n\u201cI also think we made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn\u2019t make today.\u201d\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment but has issued a statement on how it approached online content relating to the coronavirus.\n\u201cWhen confronted with a deadly pandemic, this administration encouraged responsible actions to protect public health and safety,\u201d a spokesman told Politico. \u201cOur position has been clear and consistent: We believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have on the American people, while making independent choices about the information they present.\u201d\nAmid fears of a \u201ctsunami of misinformation\u201d ahead of the November elections, Zuckerberg is digging his heels in against any political pressure to come.\nHe added: \u201cI feel strongly that we should not compromise our content standards due to pressure from any administration in either direction\u2014and we\u2019re ready to push back if something like this happens again.\u201d\nOverall Zuckerberg\u2019s letter seeks to disentangle both Meta\u2014which is currently being investigated by the European Commission over claims it is failing to adequately tackle disinformation\u2014and himself from politics.\nAt the end of the letter Zuckerberg adds: \u201cI want to address the contributions I made during the last presidential cycle to support electoral infrastructure. The idea here was to make sure local election jurisdictions across the country had the resources they needed to help people vote safely during a global pandemic.\u201d\nThe contributions were made through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative\u2014a philanthropic body cofounded and led by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan\u2014totaling more than $400 million.\nAt the time, critics\u2014including then-President Donald Trump\u2014baselessly claimed the funds were being used to get then\u2013Democratic nominee Joe Biden elected.\nIndeed a study from UCLA published in May discovered the funds donated by the billionaire\u2014nicknamed \u201cZuckerbucks\u201d by critics\u2014\u201cdid not substantially improve the performance of Democratic candidates.\u201d\nThe contributions, designed to be nonpartisan, were spread across a range of urban and rural communities, Zuckerberg said.\nHe continued: \u201cStill, despite the analyses I\u2019ve seen showing otherwise, I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other. My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another\u2014or to even appear to be playing a role. So I don\u2019t plan on making a similar contribution this cycle.\u201d\nIn the letter, Zuckerberg also confirms Meta has axed a policy of demoting stories until fact-checkers can confirm they are accurate.\nThe decision was taken after Meta was approached by the FBI, Zuckerberg writes, \u201cabout a potential Russian disinformation operation about the Biden family and Burisma in the lead-up to the 2020 election.\u201d\nZuckerberg explains: \u201cThat fall, when we saw a New York Post story reporting on corruption allegations involving then\u2013Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s family, we sent that story to fact-checkers for review and temporarily demoted it while waiting for a reply.\u201d\nIn retrospect, Zuckerberg adds, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t have demoted the story,\u201d and as such \u201cwe\u2019ve changed our policies and processes to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d\nThe letter and information in Zuckerberg\u2019s letter has been lauded by the GOP. Despite the evidence that Zuckerberg\u2019s donations made no difference in the outcome of the election, the House Judiciary GOP wrote on Elon Musk\u2013owned X: \u201cNo more Zuck-bucks. Huge win for election integrity.\u201d\nMeta did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "By Victor Pinheiro\nS\u00c3O PAULO - Meta Platforms faces a fine of up to $3.62 million after losing a lawsuit by Brazilian department store chain Havan that accused the social media company of accepting paid advertisements that fraudulently use the retailer's name to deceive consumers.\nA Santa Catarina state judge ruled on Monday that Meta had 48 hours to block ads that Havan did not contract and which mention it or its owner, billionaire Luciano Hang. If Meta does not comply, fines can go up to 20 million reais.\nIn her ruling, Judge Joana Ribeiro said it was unacceptable for Meta to sell ads in an insecure way to sustain its business model.\nIn a statement on Monday, Havan called the decision \"a landmark\" in protecting the company's and Hang's rights.\nMeta declined to comment. The company can appeal the decision.\nIn the lawsuit, Havan said Meta profits from illicit ads without taking responsibility or verifying their legitimacy, leading fraud victims to sue the retailer.\nEarlier this year, Reuters' fact-checking service in Brazil verified three false Havan ads on Meta platforms that used Hang's image. All showed signs of artificial intelligence being used to imitate the businessman's voice.\nThe fraudulent ads led victims to pay for nonexistent products.\n($1 = 5.5209 reais)\n(Writing by Bernardo Barbosa; Editing by Richard Chang)\n"

The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\u00a0META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone. It witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\u00a0Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta here >>>)Shares of Sanofi have gained +11.0% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry\u2019s gain of +24.8%. The company is witnessing generic erosion of Aubagio in all key markets and lower sales from mature products are hurting sales. Other headwinds include the weak performance of diabetes drugs and regular negative pipeline developments.Nevertheless, Dupixent has become the key top-line driver for Sanofi as it enjoys strong demand across all approved indications and geographies. Sanofi possesses a leading vaccine portfolio, which has become a key top-line driver.\u00a0Sanofi has also launched several new drugs in the past couple of years.

Also, its diversified product portfolio is significantly exposed to volatile interest rates, stricter government regulations and limited credit availability in unstable capital and credit markets.However, CME Group\u2019s strong market position, driven by varied derivative product lines, bodes well. Efforts to expand and cross-sell through strategic alliances, acquisitions, new product initiatives and a stable global presence are encouraging.\u00a0While higher electronic trading volume adds scalability, product innovation and a growing proportion of volume from customers outside the United States have been driving results. Solid liquidity supports wealth distribution to shareholders.(You can read the full research report on CME here >>>)Shares of Cato have underperformed the Zacks Retail - Apparel and Shoes industry over the year-to-date period (-29.0% vs. +6.2%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $98.05 million is facing concerns which include declining same-store sales, store closures, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, and low e-commerce sales, which can dampen growth and profitability.Nevertheless, Cato's first-quarter 2024 highlights robust earnings, effective cost management, and a strong financial foundation. Net income surged 148% to $11 million, driven by operational efficiency and cost control, showcasing resilience. Cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses decreased, boosting margins.\u00a0With $477.2 million in total assets and $39.1 million in cash, Cato's financial stability supports growth. Consistent dividends ($0.17 per share) and share repurchases (431,415 shares) underscore shareholder value commitment.

        "Title": "Meta lets you cross-post from Instagram and Facebook to Threads. Here\u2019s how to do it.",
        "Author": "  Lauren Forristal ",
        "Text": "Meta for months has been experimenting with letting people cross-post from Instagram and Facebook to Threads, its social networking platform competing with X (formally known as Twitter). Meta confirmed to TechCrunch that the feature has officially rolled out globally to all countries where Threads is available.\nThe new cross-posting capability is part of Meta\u2019s larger goal to get the most out of the content people share on its family of apps. Meta has done this with Instagram and Facebook for years now, allowing users who are active on both platforms to share Facebook posts to Instagram and vice versa. The company also played around with cross-posting in 2023 when it automatically displayed suggested Threads posts on Instagram and Facebook. (You can now turn this option off.)\nConnecting Threads more closely to Meta's larger app ecosystem and its billions of users could also help boost Threads' app \u2014 which recently surpassed 200 million active users \u2014 even more.\nThe new cross-posting feature on Instagram, which became available as a test in early May, is an opt-in experience and requires users to toggle on the Threads sharing button when posting an image. Once users cross-post their Instagram posts, the caption becomes text for the Threads post, and hashtags convert into plain text.\nUsers can either choose to use the cross-post option once or set up automatic sharing to always cross-post to Threads. The feature is available to all users globally on iOS and Android devices. However, there\u2019s no option to cross-post Instagram Reels to Threads.\nThreads cross-posting tests started rolling out to Facebook users in late February. Similar to how users can turn on the option for Instagram cross-posting, there is a new Threads option that users can enable when typing a post. At the top, next to options like \u201cOnly Me\u201d and \u201cAdd an Album,\u201d users should see the Threads logo with it either turned \u201cOn\u201d or \u201cOff.\u201d\nThe feature only applies to text and link posts, not videos. The feature is available on Android, iOS and in all countries where Threads is available.\nThe ability to cross-post from Instagram and Facebook to Threads could simplify the posting process for content creators, social media managers and business owners, saving them valuable time and effort. Instead of creating different content for each platform, they can reach multiple audiences simultaneously with the same post.\nHowever, it's important to consider if posting the same content across platforms is the right strategy for certain posts, as they may not translate well. For example, an Instagram post with a bunch of hashtags may look odd on Threads since it\u2019ll appear as plain text. Threads has tags, but they don't use the hash symbol.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/22/how-to-cross-post-from-instagram-and-facebook-to-threads/\n"

        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with META.\nAs of 2024-08-05, Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $677.32. It's currently trading at a price of $488.105. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 27.94%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$19.68\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.74%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 35.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n744.53\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n1195.72\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n677.32\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $649.21. This valuation indicates that the Meta Platforms Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 24.82%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 19, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN.\nLast week the market experienced its sharpest correction of the year, with the VIX index shooting above 60 and the broad market falling more than 10% in just a few weeks. But the buying impulse has been even more surprising as the V-shaped recovery has caught many investors off guard.\nIn hindsight, it seems that the intense selling seen last Monday may have been a one-off event, with unwind of the Japanese carry trade causing a capitulation among the most levered traders. Even though stocks have rapidly appreciated from last week\u2019s lows, many are still on sale, most notably stocks from the Magnificent 7, which make up the largest and some of the best performing in the market.\nLooking back to last week\u2019s lows, we can see which of the group has rallied the most. Relative strength is one of my favorite ways to find winning stocks as it often points to those with the most momentum and investor interest. Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Amazon have seen the fastest gains since the lows, leading me to believe they may continue to lead the Mag 7 and the broad market.\nIt can be hard to buy stocks right after they have run up, but history tells us that strength often begets more strength. However, markets don\u2019t move in a straight line and if it is difficult to pull the trigger on these stocks, there is nothing wrong for waiting on a pullback. But when the pullback does eventually come, you must have the courage to execute the plan.\nBut how can investors be confident when buying pullbacks? If you take inventory of the broader picture, the economy and stock market should be conducive for the foreseeable future, giving investors security when buying.\nThe economy is growing above trend and remained robust throughout the Fed raising cycle, earnings are growing nicely, and we can expect lower interest rates in the near future. With lower interest rates, we can expect the economy to begin expanding again, which should encourage profit growth at corporations and even some multiple expansion in stock valuations.\nIf we look at the seasonality chart, we can see that there may be some weakness in stocks in the second half of September into October. Additionally, with the US presidential election looming this fall, there may be some additional pangs of uncertainty, possibly adding to any temporary selloffs.\nThus, if we don\u2019t get any pullbacks over the next week or two, investors can remain patient as there should be more buying opportunities before the year end.\nSo, we covered why investors can be confident that the broad market should hold up, but what about Nvidia, Amazon and Meta Platforms are still so appealing as investments? More than anything, these companies are growing profits at truly incredible rates, especially for their immense size.\nAlthough each of these companies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating, reflecting flat earnings revisions trends, the earnings growth forecasts are more than reason enough to consider buying. Earnings per share (EPS) are projected to grow 37.6% annually at Nvidia, 27.4% annually at Amazon and 19% annually at Meta Platforms over the next three to five years. While not a perfect comparison, stocks typically appreciate in line with their earnings growth over the long term, which could translate to impressive price gains for these companies.\nThese companies sit directly in the front seat of the most important secular business and technology trends, which is why they expect such impressive growth. From Artificial Intelligence, to cloud computing, e-commerce, and digital communities, they will be the leaders in these high growth high profit businesses.\nFurthermore, they all have fairly reasonable valuations, especially compared to historical averages. Meta platforms is trading at 25.3x, right in line with its 10-year median, Amazon is trading at 36.7x, well below its 10-year median of 93.6x and Nvidia is trading at 48.5x, just above its 10-year median of 42.7x.\nWhile the recent market recovery has been swift and robust, it's crucial to remember that the market can be unpredictable. Although the economic environment and earnings growth for companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta Platforms remain favorable, markets don't move in a straight line. There could be pullbacks, especially with seasonal trends and the upcoming election adding potential volatility.\nHowever, when these pullbacks occur, they should be seen as opportunities for disciplined investors to enter or add to positions in high-quality stocks. Always prioritize risk management and ensure that your investment decisions align with your long-term goals, as the market will do what it wants, regardless of expectations.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Lauren Forristal ",
        "Text": "Meta and Universal Music Group (UMG) announced on Monday the expansion of their multi-year music licensing agreement, which enables users to share songs from UMG's music library across Meta\u2019s platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Horizon, Threads and WhatsApp) without violating copyright.\nWhat\u2019s most notable about the new agreement is that it states that the two companies are addressing \u201cunauthorized AI-generated content.\u201d This refers to songs being scraped by AI systems, often without the consent of the original creators. Artists and songwriters are increasingly grappling with AI fakes and their work being used by AI companies to train their models.\n\u201cWe look forward to continuing to work together to address unauthorized AI-generated content that could affect artists and songwriters so that UMG can continue to protect their rights both now and in the future,\u201d Michael Nash, chief digital officer and executive vice president at UMG said in a statement.\nThe partnership follows TikTok\u2019s feud with UMG earlier this year when the label's catalog of music was removed from the short-form video app. In a statement released in February, UMG emphasized its concerns about AI and online safety on the platform. The two companies called a truce in May, allowing music from artists like Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift back on TikTok.\nThe new agreement also comes on the heels of an AI-related lawsuit filed by the Recording Industry Association of America (which represents UMG and other major labels) against music generation startups Udio and Suno. The lawsuit alleges the two companies trained their AI models using copyrighted music. Earlier this month, Sudo publicly admitted to using copyrighted songs but claimed it was legal under fair use.\nMeanwhile, Meta claims to be taking an ethical approach to AI music, only releasing generative AI models (AudioCraft, MusicGen and Jasco) that are trained with \"Meta-owned and specifically licensed music,\" according to its website. However, as noted by TechCrunch's Kyle Wiggers, Meta has acknowledged that AudioCraft could potentially be misused to create a deepfake of someone\u2019s voice.\nAdditionally, this is the first time that WhatsApp users can share licensed music from UMG within the instant messaging app. It also includes Threads, the Meta-owned social networking app and X\u2019s (Twitter) direct competitor.\nMeta and UMG initially partnered in 2017, marking the first time a major music company allowed Facebook users to upload and share videos featuring songs from its music catalog.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/12/meta-universal-music-group-address-ai-generated-content/\n"

But the obvious question remains \u2013 is anybody actually benefiting?\nThe answer is yes.\nSeveral companies, including Palantir and Meta Platforms, are actually reaping the benefits of AI, as reflected by their quarterly results. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each.\nPalantir\u2019s quarterly release was filled with positivity, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations. Revenue soared 27% year-over-year, whereas EPS climbed 200%. The company builds software that empowers organizations to effectively integrate their data, decisions, and operations.\nThe company\u2019s platform continues to be highly attractive, reflected by 41% year-over-year customer growth. Impressively, PLTR closed over 27 deals worth $10 million throughout the period, further reflecting the snowballing demand.\nThough strength was broad, the company\u2019s US commercial sales were notably bright, growing 55% year-over-year alongside an 83% customer increase. The CEO delivered a notably bullish statement following the print, stating \u2013\n\u2018In Q2 2024, we generated $159 million in revenue in the U.S. commercial market alone, an increase of 55% from the same period the year before. The growth rate was even more significant, at 70% year-over-year, when excluding strategic commercial contracts. And the persistent and unbridled demand for our software, for an effective enterprise platform that makes artificial intelligence capabilities useful to large institutions, shows no sign of relenting.\u2019\nAnalysts have adjusted their current year sales expectations accordingly following the robust release, with the now $2.8 billion expected suggesting a 21% jump.\nThe stock remains a prime selection for those seeking AI exposure, further reinforced by its favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\nMega-cap giant Meta Platforms was one of the few Mag 7 members to see a positive reaction to its quarterly results, with the company again exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations. The stock remains a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook reflecting bullishness across the board.\nThe company delivered a stunning statement in the release, with Mark Zuckerberg saying, \u2018We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,\" \nHe continued, \"We've released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see\u00a0good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we're driving good growth across our apps.\" \nMeta also raised its CapEx outlook into a band of $37 - $40 billion ($35 - $40 billion prior) to support its artificial intelligence roadmap.\nThe valuation picture for META remains attractive, with the current 21.5X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 31.5X. In addition, the current PEG ratio works out to 1.1X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth.\nWhile companies continue to seemingly throw around the AI buzzword in their quarterly releases, several, including Palantir and Meta Platforms, are actually benefitting from AI, with the trends expected to continue.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nAs of 2024-08-19, Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $679.28. It's currently trading at a price of $527.42. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 22.36%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage.

Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "By Gnaneshwar Rajan and Nandita Bose\n(Reuters) - Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the Biden administration had pressured the company to \"censor\" COVID-19 content during the pandemic, apparently referring to White House requests to take down misinformation about the coronavirus and vaccines.\nIn a letter dated Aug. 26, Zuckerberg told the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee that he regretted not speaking up about this pressure earlier, as well as other decisions he had made as the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp around removing certain content.\nIn July 2021, President Joe Biden, a Democrat, said social media platforms like Facebook \"are killing people\" for allowing misinformation about coronavirus vaccines to be posted on its platform.\nOthers like former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy publicly said the company was not doing enough to take down misinformation, and was making it harder to fight the pandemic and save lives.\nFacebook said at the time it was taking \"aggressive steps\" to fight such misinformation. The Biden administration ultimately eased up on its criticism, even as vaccine lies continued to spread on social media.\nIn the letter to the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee on Monday, Zuckerberg said his company was \"pressured\" into \"censoring\" content and that the company would push back if it faced such demands again.\n\"In 2021, senior officials from the Biden Administration, including the White House, repeatedly pressured our teams for months to censor certain COVID-19 content, including humor and satire, and expressed a lot of frustration with our teams when we didn't agree,\" Zuckerberg wrote in the letter, which was posted by the Judiciary Committee on its Facebook page.\n\"I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret we were not more outspoken about it,\" he wrote. \"I also think we made some choices that, with the benefit of hindsight and new information, we wouldn't make today.\"\nThe White House said in a statement the administration encouraged responsible actions to protect public health and safety when confronted with a deadly pandemic.\n\"Our position has been clear and consistent: we believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have on the American people, while making independent choices about the information they present.\"\nZuckerberg has recently tried to appeal to conservative users, by complimenting Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s response to an assassination attempt as \"badass\" and going on right-wing podcasts. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Representative Jim Jordan, is a longtime Trump ally.\nIn its Facebook post, the Judiciary Committee called the letter a \"big win for free speech\" and said that Zuckerberg had admitted that \"Facebook censored Americans\".\nIn the letter, Zuckerberg also said he would not make any contributions to support electoral infrastructure in this year's presidential election so as to \"not play a role one way or another\" in the November vote.\nDuring the last election, which was held in 2020 during the pandemic, the billionaire contributed $400 million via the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, his philanthropy venture with his wife, to support election infrastructure, a move that drew criticism and lawsuits from some groups that said the move was partisan.\n(Reporting by Nandita Bose in Washington and Gnaneshwar Rajan in Bengaluru; editing by Miral Fahmy, Heather Timmons and Jonathan Oatis)\n"

        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cYear of Efficiency\u201d at Meta\u2014a cost-cutting drive that began in February 2023 with the likely goal of diverting resources to AI's costly needs\u2014keeps getting extended. And it seems to be having a major effect on the company\u2019s augmented reality efforts.\nMeta is widely expected to show off a prototype of its first AR glasses, codenamed Orion, next month. (Meta already makes \u201csmart glasses\u201d with EssilorLuxottica that don\u2019t overlay any digital information on the lens, and it makes relatively bulky Quest headsets that offer \u201cmixed reality\u201d AR/VR features on their screens. Orion would presumably fit somewhere in-between these offerings.)\nBut Fortune\u2019s Kali Hays reported yesterday that the device won\u2019t be powered by custom chips, as was originally planned. This in-house development effort was killed off last year, meaning Orion and its successors will run on Qualcomm silicon. It remains to be seen how much of an effect forgoing custom chips will have on performance and power efficiency.\nAs Kali reported: \u201cAmid mass layoffs and cost-cutting efforts throughout the company, work on custom chips was deemed too expensive, and the need for the chips too far removed from current business priorities.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s not all. Yesterday, Meta announced it will kill off the \u201cSpark\u201d toolset that third-party developers have for years used to easily create AR effects for Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger\u2014and even for exhibitions and art installations, via a desktop application.\nMeta\u2019s own Spark AR effects for its stable of apps will survive, but, less than five months from now, bang goes all the work that brands and individual creators have done on the platform over the last eight years.\nNow\u2019s a good time to revisit the heartwarming videos about the Spark ecosystem that Meta once published, such as this one about how a creator found purpose in making scary clown-face overlays for U2 singer Bono. People built businesses around making and even selling Spark AR effects, but all those filters and 3D objects will be deleted along with the Spark platform. (Videos that already feature the effects won't be impacted.)\n\u201cThis decision is part of our larger efforts to prioritize the products we believe will best serve the future needs of our consumers and business customers alike,\u201d Meta said in a statement that set Jan. 14 next year as the termination date for third-party Spark effects. A separate Q&A says Meta will \u201cprioritize investments in other company priorities,\u201d which is about as vague as you can get.\nSpark effect creators, unsurprisingly, are pretty furious.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge disrespect to us and also to the Facebook/Instagram users,\u201d TechCrunch quotes one creator, Douglas Costa, as saying. \u201cFive months to end development? It should be at least a year so that we creators can have a better opportunity to build a new portfolio or find a new job.\u201d\nSo it will be interesting to see not only the hardware that Meta reveals next month, but also whether the company is still interested in having any kind of third-party developer ecosystem around its AR platform. If so, it will have some convincing to do. But maybe effect development will just turn out to be another job for AI.\nMore news below.\nDavid Meyer\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "The market trajectory for meta-xylene is also being driven by growth in the packaging industry. The packaging industry is using more meta-xylene as a result of the rapid uptake of PET packaging solutions.\nWilmington, Delaware, United States, Transparency Market Research Inc. - , Aug. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global meta-xylene market (\uba54\ud0c0\uc790\uc77c\ub80c \uc2dc\uc7a5) was projected to attain US$ 1.4 billion in 2023. It is likely to garner a 5% CAGR from 2024 to 2034, and by 2034, the market is expected to attain US$ 2.5 billion.\nThe xylene, known as meta-xylene or m-xylene, has methyl groups at positions 1 and 3. This aromatic hydrocarbon is very flammable and colorless, much like the other isomers of xylene. It is sometimes referred to as 1,3-xylene or 1,3-dimethylbenzene. The main uses of meta-xylene are as an organic synthesis and dye solvent and intermediary.\nAdditionally, it is a non-food pesticide product's inert component. The production of polyesters, alkyd resins, pesticides, and aviation fuel are among further uses.\nFrom mixed xylene feedstock, meta-xylene is recovered using the UOP MX Sorbex method. A mixture of aromatic isomers, such as ethyl benzene, para-, meta-, and ortho-xylenes, is referred to as mixed xylenes. P-xylene, an additional aromatic hydrocarbon that is utilized as a raw material in the large-scale synthesis of different polymers, is typically produced by isomerizing meta-xylene.\nRequest for sample PDF copy of report: https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=86054\nKey Findings of Market Report \nXylenes are frequently used in the production of synthetic polymers and a variety of solvents. Meta-xylene serves as a chemical intermediary for dyes and pesticides as well as being employed in the manufacturing of high-value resins. Purified isophthalic acid is made with it.\nIn end-use sectors, including packaging, automotive, construction, electronics, textiles, and healthcare, there is an increasing need for synthetic polymers. Consequently, this is boosting the market value of meta-xylene.\nGood strength, resistivity, and flexibility are provided by synthetic polymers. They have a lower compression set, enhanced grip, less oil migration, and heat resistance in the automobile industry.\nMarket Trends For Meta-xylene\nXylenes are a necessary raw ingredient used in the production of packaging materials. The primary usage of p-xylene is in the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a polymer found in many fibers, films, and plastic goods. The income from the meta-xylene market is increasing due to the increase in plastic packaging manufacture.\nA paper published in the open-access journal MDPI states that, in response to the increasing demand for PET, plastic packaging output is predicted to rise from 140 million tons in 2023 to over 180 million tons in 2029.\nThe demand for meta-xylene in the market is being driven by the increased use of Unsaturated Polyester Resin (UPR) coatings on automobiles and aircraft, which is increasing the production of purified isophthalic acid.\nBoats, wind turbine blades, and powder coatings are other products made with UPR coatings. It is anticipated that rising maintenance and repair costs for aircraft will accelerate the expansion of the meta-xylene market in the near future.\nIn 2022, American Airlines expended US$ 2.68 billion on upkeep, supplies, and repairs, a 35.6% increase over 2021. In 2022, United Airlines spent US$ 2.15 billion, a 20% increase over the previous year.\nUnlock Growth Potential in Your Industry! Download PDF Brochure: https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&rep_id=86054\nGlobal Market for Meta-xylene: Regional Outlook\nVarious reasons propel the meta-xylene market (\u30e1\u30bf\u30ad\u30b7\u30ec\u30f3\u5e02\u5834) growth throughout the regions. These are:\nAsia Pacific retained the greatest position in the meta-xylene market in 2023, according to the most recent data. The packaging industry's growth is improving the region's market dynamics. China and India are becoming more and more in need of laminates and flexible packaging, particularly PET and woven sacks.\nThe market share of meta-xylene in Asia Pacific is also being enhanced by an increase in demand for synthetic polymers. Because of their great strength and flexibility, synthetic polymers are widely used in a variety of industries, including aerospace, automotive, and architecture.\nGlobal Meta-xylene Market: Key Players \nPrincipal firms involved in the global meta-xylene industry are concentrated on creating catalysts for xylene isomerization and semi-regenerative reformers.\nSulfolane is another solvent they're employing for the aromatic extraction procedure. Sulfolane is a useful solvent for eliminating acidic elements from sour natural gas, including carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide.\nVendors may expect to benefit greatly from the meta-xylene market through R&D of molecular sieves for p-xylene separation and catalysts for the disproportionation and transalkylation of toluene and Cg aromatics.\nPotential for xylene isomer separations is demonstrated by carbon molecular sieve membranes made from spirobifluorene-based polymers with intrinsic microporosity under both conventional and hydrogen-added pyrolysis conditions. This implies that materials for carbon molecular sieves could be helpful for high-throughput separations.\nThe following companies are well-known participants in the global meta-xylene market:\nLOTTE Chemical\nMitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc.\nHoneywell International Inc.\nInChem Holdings, Inc.\nTCI Chemicals\nFengchen Group Co., Ltd.\nVizag Chemicals\nOtto Chemie Pvt.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 15, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META and AppLovin APP.\nLast week the market experienced one of the fastest rises in volatility since the Covid-19 pandemic and the Great Financial Crisis. The VIX index rose above 60 on Monday morning, which was a 40-point jump from the day before. However, what followed was equally impressive as volatility fell nearly just as fast as it rose, and today the VIX is below 17.\nWe know now that the unwind of the Yen carry trade led to a capitulation of the most levered traders and it seems that the worst is already behind us. And it makes sense that we can look forward confidently and use this as an opportunity to pick up shares in the best stocks.\nWe have a nice list of bullish factors holding up this market; the economy remains robust while inflation continues to ease, the Federal Reserve will begin lowering rates soon leading to an expansionary policy and earnings at the best companies in the world continue to grow nicely.\nSometimes you must see through the scary headlines and look at the most important variables that drive markets such as Fed liquidity and earnings growth. When investors do it like that, they can see these sharp corrections for what they really are, opportunities.\nSome of the best stocks in the world went on sale this last week and here I am going to identify three of my favorites. Nvidia, Meta Platforms and AppLovin have been some of the best performing stocks in the last year and based on their Zacks Ranks, growth forecasts and valuations remain unambiguously attractive.\nLesser known than the other two, AppLovin is a mobile technology company that specializes in mobile app growth, monetization, and user acquisition through its suite of software and services. AppLovin provides a powerful platform that enables app developers to enhance their marketing strategies, optimize user engagement, and maximize revenue. The company operates one of the largest mobile ad networks in the world and has also expanded into app development, acquiring and partnering with various gaming studios.\nAppLovin really has it all, as the stock enjoys powerful momentum pushing it higher, strong growth forecasts and a very reasonable valuation. Additionally, AppLovin has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, boosting the odds of a near-term rally. Analysts have unanimously raised earnings estimates by a significant margin in just the last week. Over the next three to five years, analysts expect earnings per share (EPS) to grow 20% annually.\nEven with the incredible appreciation the stock has experienced over the last two years it still trades near its lowest relative valuation. Because sales and earnings are growing so fast, the stock has actually gotten cheaper over the last year. Today, APP is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.9x, which is right in line with the broad market and well below its three-year median of 64.5x.\nMeta Platforms is another stock that has put up truly stellar earnings results and price appreciation since the 2022 lows. In the chart below we can see that the price of META is bumping up against its recent all-time highs, and if it clears that level could begin another major bull leg.\nAlso visible in the chart is just how well Meta Platforms stock held up during the recent market correction and how quickly it has snapped higher.\nAlso worth noting is that Meta Platforms boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions and improving the near-term outlook of the stock. In the last month FY24 earning estimates have increased by 3.7% and FY25 by 2.6%. Current year sales are expected to grow 19.6% and next year's sales are expected to climb 14%. Furthermore, analysts project EPS to grow 19% annually over the next three to five years.\nMeta Platforms is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 24.9x, which is just above the market average and just below its 10-year median of 25.1x. META also now pays a tidy 0.38% dividend to shareholders.\nFor the first time in nearly two years, Nvidia is not at the top of the Zacks rank, however it still boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. Nvidia has of course been hugely influential to the broader market and the primary beneficiary of the AI boom. The company's vision into what AI could be, and its ability to position itself as the key piece of infrastructure for the technology had set it on a path to more than triple its sales and nearly 7x its EPS in the last two years.\nOver the last month the stock experienced its sharpest correction since the big bull run began, but like the others, investors have been snapping up shares during the sell off. Also like the others, Nvidia still enjoys a reasonable valuation, attracting new investors.\nWe can also see that the price action in NVDA is looking quite bullish as well, as on Monday, the stock broke out from a descending channel.\nToday, Nvidia is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 45.8x. This is above the broad market average and just above its 10-year median of 42.7x. Although that may appear elevated to some investors,analysts forecast NVDA EPS to grow 37.6% annually over the next three to five years, simply indicating a valuation priced for tremendous growth in profits.\nAs markets show signs of rebounding, the potential for the next leg higher is enticing. Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and AppLovin have all demonstrated strong fundamentals, impressive growth forecasts, and reasonable valuations that make them attractive picks. However, it's essential to remember that the market is unpredictable and can turn volatile without warning.\nWhile the current outlook might be optimistic, investors should always prioritize risk management. Maintaining a diversified portfolio, setting stop-loss orders, and not overcommitting to any single position can help mitigate potential downsides. The market will ultimately do what it wants, and staying vigilant while focusing on long-term goals is key to navigating these opportunities wisely.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Meta\u2019s next AI model to require nearly 10 times the power to train",
        "Author": "  Andrew Tarantola ",
        "Text": "Facebook parent company Meta will continue to invest heavily in its artificial intelligence research efforts, despite expecting the nascent technology to require years of work before becoming profitable, company executives explained on the company\u2019s Q2 earnings call Wednesday.\nMeta is \u201cplanning for the compute clusters and data we\u2019ll need for the next several years,\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the call. Meta will need an \u201camount of compute\u2026 almost 10 times more than what we used to train Llama 3,\u201d he said, adding that Llama 4 will \u201cbe the most advanced [model] in the industry next year.\u201d For reference, the Llama 3 model was trained on a cluster of 16,384 Nvidia H100 80GB GPUs.\nThe company is no stranger to writing checks for aspirational research and development projects. Meta\u2019s Q2 financials show the company expects to spend $37 billion to $40 billion on capital expenditures in 2024, and executives expect a \u201csignificant\u201d increase in that spending next year. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future,\u201d Zuckerberg remarked. \u201cBut at this point, I\u2019d rather risk building capacity before it is needed rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new inference projects.\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s not like Meta doesn\u2019t have the money to burn. With an estimated 3.27 billion people using at least one Meta app daily, the company made just over $39 billion in revenue in Q2, a 22% increase from the previous year. Out of that, the company earned around $13.5 billion in profit, a 73% year-over-year increase.\nBut just because Meta is making a profit doesn\u2019t mean its AI efforts are profitable. CFO Susan Li conceded that its generative AI will not generate revenue this year, and reiterated that revenue from those investments will \u201ccome in over a longer period of time.\u201d Still, the company is \u201ccontinuing to build our AI infrastructure with fungibility in mind, so that we can flex capacity where we think it will be put to best use.\u201d\nLi also noted that the existing training clusters can be easily reworked to perform inference tasks, which are expected to constitute a majority of compute demand as the technology matures and more people begin using these models on a daily basis.\n\u201cAs we scale generative AI training capacity to advance our foundation models, we\u2019ll continue to build our infrastructure in a way that provides us with flexibility in how we use it over time. This will allow us to direct training capacity to gen AI inference or to our core ranking and recommendation work, when we expect that doing so would be more valuable,\u201d she said during the earnings call.\n"

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Design flaws could cause a delay of three months or more in the launch of chip giant Nvidia's upcoming artificial-intelligence chips, tech-focused publication the Information said on Friday.\nThe setback could affect customers such as Meta Platforms, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft, which have collectively ordered tens of billions of dollars' worth of chips, it said, citing people who help produce chip and server hardware for Nvidia.\nThe AI chip company unveiled its Blackwell chip series in March, succeeding its earlier flagship AI chip, the Grace Hopper Superchip, that was designed to speed generative AI applications.\n\"As we've stated before, Hopper demand is very strong, broad Blackwell sampling has started, and production is on track to ramp in the second half,\" an Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed statement in response to the report.\nMicrosoft said it had nothing to add, while Meta and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nNvidia informed Microsoft and another major cloud service provider this week of a delay in the production of its most advanced AI chip in the Blackwell series, the Information said, citing a Microsoft employee and another person with knowledge of the matter.\n(Reporting by Surbhi Misra in Bengaluru; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, William Mallard and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Title": "Trump tells his supporters to \u2018GO AFTER\u2019 Google and Meta",
        "Author": "  Eva Roytburg ",
        "Text": "Former President Donald Trump has urged his supporters to \u201cGO AFTER\u201d Meta and Google over claims that the Big Tech companies \u201ccensored\u201d information about the assassination attempt on his life during a Pennsylvania campaign rally last month.\n\u201cThey made it virtually impossible to find pictures or anything about this heinous act,\u201d Trump posted Tuesday morning on his social platform, Truth Social. \u201cHere we go again, another attempt at RIGGING THE ELECTION!!! ! GO AFTER META AND GOOGLE. LET THEM KNOW WE ARE ALL WISE TO THEM, WILL BE MUCH TOUGHER THIS TIME.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s complaint came after X users noticed that a photo of Trump, triumphantly pounding his fist in the air right after surviving the assassination attempt, was falsely flagged as \u201cdoctored\u201d on Facebook. Google similarly came under fire from GOP supporters after users noticed that its \u201cautocomplete\u201d function failed to suggest results for the attempted assassination, even when users prompted it with \u201cassassination attempt on Tru.\u201d\nBoth platforms denied any malicious intent. Meta said its fact-checking filter had initially been applied to an altered photo showing Secret Service agents smiling as they helped Trump get off the campaign rally stage after he was shot. The filter was, however, incorrectly applied to the real photo as well, an error that a spokesperson said had been fixed. Google noted that its filters were intended to prevent searches encouraging political violence, and said it was committed to improving autocomplete to stay more up-to-date with news.\nStill, several figures in Silicon Valley, skeptical of the platforms\u2019 response, cheered on Trump\u2019s message to pursue Meta and Google.\n\u201cTech guys don\u2019t use Google Search anymore,\u201d Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former CTO of crypto exchange Coinbase, wrote on X Wednesday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s not just censored. It sucks.\u201d\nSrinivasan did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment by press time.\nElon Musk, who owns X and has endorsed Trump repeatedly, posted on Wednesday that he \u201cjust did a search for \u2018Trump Rally\u2019 on Google, and Kamala was the top result!\u201d\nA Fortune reporter typed in \u201cTrump rally\u201d on Chrome using incognito mode, and suggestions for \u201cKamala Harris rally in Atlanta\u201d were the first to pop up. However, every article in the carousel mentioned \u201cTrump\u201d and \u201crally\u201d in the headline. The next carousel was \u201cTrump rally in Pennsylvania.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s communications team wrote in an X thread that their goal was to help people get the most relevant results from a query.\n\u201cThese labels are automatically generated based on related news topics, and they change over time,\u201d the team wrote. \u201cThey span the political spectrum as well: For example, a search for \u2018Kamala Harris\u2019 showed Top Stories labeled with \u2018Donald Trump,\u2019 because many articles cover the two of them together.\u201d\nNeither Google CEO Sundar Pichai nor Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has endorsed a candidate in the 2024 presidential race.\nStill, Musk\u2014who did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment\u2014has utilized the situation to flex X\u2019s strength, and has posted his platform\u2019s outperformance over Facebook and Instagram.\nThis is unrelated to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Musk\u2019s rivalry, however. Musk\u2019s comments reify what is turning out to be an unusually tense election season in Silicon Valley, filled with surprise endorsements and vitriolic X debates. Over the past few weeks, billionaire venture capitalists, startup founders, and high-profile tech celebrities have been dividing into political camps, spending millions to best each other and sway the presidential election in November.\nHere\u2019s a look at who the biggest names in the Valley support.\nDonald Trump supporters\nMany tech leaders who support Trump are also leaders in the crypto space. That\u2019s because Trump, who just attended Bitcoin\u2019s annual conference in Nashville, has branded himself as the crypto president. At that conference, he vowed to make the U.S. a crypto \u201csuperpower,\u201d fire the chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and create a national reserve of Bitcoin.\nMost crypto heavyweights have backed the Republican nominee. Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen, cofounders of tech venture capital firm a16z and among the world\u2019s largest investors in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, announced their endorsement of Trump on a podcast.\n\u201cFor little tech, we think Donald Trump is actually the right choice. Sorry, Mum, I know you\u2019re going to be mad at me for this, but we had to do it,\u201d Horowitz said. On that same podcast, Andreessen said the Democrats\u2019 insistence on regulating crypto was what made him flip: \u201cMy big concern is what we saw in crypto was the foreshadowing of what\u2019s going to happen in AI.\u201d\nARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, who has invested heavily in crypto, also announced her endorsement for Trump.\nThe Winklevoss twins, who founded crypto exchange Gemini, have supported Trump as well, donating $1 million each to the candidate. Meanwhile, crypto-related political action committees have spent over $28.5 million in support of crypto-friendly Republicans\u2014and against skeptical Democrats\u2014in congressional races, according to an OpenSecrets analysis of campaign data published as of July 20.\nOn Wednesday evening, David Marcus, cocreator of Diem, a crypto project initiated by Facebook, posted on X that he was \u201ccrossing the Rubicon\u201d and switching from being a Democrat to supporting Trump.\nTrump has also won broad support from other tech leaders. David Sacks, the venture capital investor and former PayPal COO who cohosts the All-In podcast, organized a fundraiser for Trump that reportedly raked in $12 million.\nSequoia Capital\u2019s Shaun Maguire previously told Fortune he lost friends and \u201cdisappointed family\u201d after his X announcement that he was donating $300,000 to the Trump campaign. \u201cBut that\u2019s okay, I was expecting it. It\u2019s sad we live in a time of such extreme polarization.\u201d\nKamala Harris supporters\nSeveral titans in the tech industry support Vice President Kamala Harris, who is poised to win the Democratic nomination.\nReid Hoffman, investor and cofounder of LinkedIn and InflectionAI, is a longtime Democratic donor and has invested $7 million in Future Forward, a leading Democratic super PAC, this year. He has also reportedly been calling friends and donors to get them into the campaign.\nAdditionally, on Wednesday, more than 100 venture capitalists announced a pledge to vote for Harris in November and solicit donations for her presidential campaign.\nThe group, VCsforKamala, includes Hoffman; venture capitalist Vinod Khosla; Mark Cuban, minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks; and angel investor Ron Conway.\n\u201cWe are pro-business, pro\u2013American dream, pro-entrepreneurship, and pro\u2013technological progress,\u201d the group said in a statement, which they posted to their website.\nMore than 500 people have signed the VCsforKamala pledge to vote for Harris. All of them appear to be venture capital investors, founders, or tech leaders.\nOutside venture capital, Harris has the support of Reed Hastings, cofounder and executive chairman of Netflix, who has donated $7 million to her campaign. Aaron Levie, CEO of content management software firm Box, has also endorsed Harris, but told Politico he and other executives are waiting to see details of Harris\u2019s tech plans before donating to her campaign.\nFormer Meta chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said she was \u201cthrilled\u201d to support Harris in an Instagram post. Philanthropist Melinda French Gates, ex-wife of Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, announced she is supporting the vice president on a CBS morning show because she has an \u201cinspiring vision for America.\u201d Her ex-husband has said that he doesn\u2019t endorse anyone, because he is \u201cso associated with the foundation that works with any administration.\u201d\nFrench Gates, however, said Harris has been \u201coutspoken\u201d on topics close to her.\u201c[Harris] has believed in women\u2019s reproductive freedom from the beginning of her career, and that got rolled back under previous administrations. She knows what society is up against now. She\u2019s for paid family medical leave. She\u2019s for caregiving \u2026 She has always been outspoken on these topics, and I think she\u2019s a woman of our time,\u201d French Gates said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Meta\u2019s AI spending spree is just fine with Wall Street",
        "Author": "  Sharon Goldman ",
        "Text": "Remember Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s infamous corporate belt-tightening of 2022 and 2023 when he preached \u201cefficiency\u201d and cut thousands of jobs? These days, it\u2019s just a memory, as the company is currently on an AI spending spree. Wall Street seems just fine with that\u2014at least for now\u2014as Meta beat its Q2 earnings expectations with strong digital ad revenue, and the company\u2019s stock is up about 4% today.\nMeta\u2019s eye-popping AI spending is mostly going towards the infrastructure that supports training and running AI models\u2014such as servers, data centers, and a reported 600,000 Nvidia GPUs (which each cost roughly $30,000 each). It all adds up to the tune of\u00a0$37 billion to $40 billion in expected 2024 capital expenditures, while the company said infrastructure spending \u201cwill be a significant driver of expense growth next year\u201d as well.\nZuckerberg focused some of his earnings call comments on explaining why this AI infrastructure shopping binge will pay off with increased revenue from the company\u2019s various apps, new AI experiences, and shaping its continued work on the metaverse.\nThe bottom line? Training more and more advanced AI models is expensive: Zuckerberg pointed out that while Meta\u2019s newly released Llama 3 model is \u201calready competitive with the most advanced models,\u201d the company is already starting to work on Llama 4, which means planning for the computing power it will need going forward.\n\u201cThe amount of compute needed to train Llama 4 will likely be almost 10x more than what we used to train Llama 3\u2014and future models will continue to grow beyond that,\u201d said Zuckerberg on the earnings call. \u201cIt's hard to predict how this will trend multiple generations out into the future, but at this point, I'd rather risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than too late, given the long lead times for spinning up new infra projects.\u201d\nNot surprisingly, there were no comments given or questions asked by Wall Street analysts during the earnings call about the environmental impact of Meta\u2019s AI infrastructure efforts. But there was plenty to discuss about the potential ROI of AI investments. Zuckerberg said that improving existing Meta products with AI would drive the most results in the short-term\u2014over the next two years. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of upside\u201d to improving recommendations and advertising experiences, he explained.\nBut he warned that making money on new-gen AI products\u2014like Meta AI, the AI chatbot available on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp \u2014will take a lot longer.\n\u201cWe have a relatively long business cycle of starting a new product, scaling it to something that reaches a billion people or more, and only then really focusing on monetizing at scale,\u201d he said. When it comes to products like Meta AI or AI Studio, the company\u2019s new make-your-own AI chatbot offering which rolled out this week on Instagram, he added, \u201cI don't think that anyone should be surprised that I would expect that that will be years, right?\u201d\nOf course, Wall Street has recently worried about the massive AI spending of other Big Tech firms and how long it would take for those investments to pay off, including at Microsoft, whose stock dropped after a narrow cloud earnings miss this week.\nBut for now, it seems like as long as its AI-driven digital ad revenues stay strong\u2014and keep in mind, the artificial intelligence used for Meta\u2019s ad business uses the same traditional machine learning techniques they have used for years, not generative AI models\u2014investors will remain patient, even as they wait for the potential future profits to roll in from the promise of gen AI.\nSharon Goldman\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

        "Author": "  Claire Shefchik ",
        "Text": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s big AI gamble seems to be paying off \u2013 at least for now. Meta\u2019s shares got a nice bump late last month. The company's second-quarter results eased some of Wall Street's fears about overspending on artificial intelligence.\nHere's the scoop: Meta reported a 33% increase in capital expenditures (Capex) for the second quarter, hitting $8.17 billion. And they're not stopping there. The company bumped the low end of its 2024 Capex forecast to $37 billion, keeping the upper limit at $40 billion. That's a lot of dough, but Zuckerberg's betting on AI.\nDon't Miss:\nDon\u2019t miss out on the next Nvidia \u2013 you can invest in the future of AI for only $10.\nHere\u2019s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth \u2013 invest in it at only 10 cents per share.\nMeta isn't alone in this spending spree. Big Tech players like Alphabet and Microsoft are also throwing serious cash into AI infrastructure. Alphabet's Capex shot up 91%, and Microsoft's increased by 55% in the same quarter. But here's where it gets interesting: Wall Street reacted differently to each company's spending plans.\nTake Alphabet, for example. Despite its massive AI investment, the stock took a hit. Investors were spooked by slightly lower-than-expected YouTube ad revenue. CEO Sundar Pichai's reassurance that underinvesting was riskier than overspending didn't do much to calm the market. The result? The tech sector saw its most painful sell-off in over a year.\nTrending: Groundbreaking trading app with a \u2018Buy-Now-Pay-Later' feature for stocks tackles the $644 billion margin lending market \u2013 here\u2019s how to get equity in it with just $100\nMicrosoft had its roller coaster moment. The company's cloud unit missed revenue estimates by just 1% \u2013 growing 29% instead of 30% \u2013 and their full-year Capex hit $69 billion, up 60% from the previous year. The stock initially plunged, but then CFO Amy Hood stepped in. She explained that the cloud revenue was hurt by European economic issues and \u201ccapacity constraints\u201d \u2013 they didn't have enough infrastructure to meet AI demand. That reassurance helped the stock recover most of its losses.\nSo, why did Meta manage to keep investors happy while others stumbled? Angelo Zino, a CFRA analyst, thinks it comes down to clarity. Zuckerberg kicked off Meta's earnings call by laying out a concrete AI strategy. He talked about AI Studio, where users can create their own AIs, and Business AIs, which could eventually handle customer service or sales.\nTrending: General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up \u2014 allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.\nZuckerberg's message was simple: Meta's AI is already boosting engagement across its platforms by improving content recommendations. This isn't just talk \u2013 Meta's revenue jumped 20% in the second quarter thanks to higher ad impressions and prices.\nAccording to Zino, Meta's AI story is easier for investors to digest than the more complicated narratives from companies like Alphabet. And with Meta's strong growth numbers, they're outpacing the competition in the digital ad market.\nFor now, Zuckerberg's obsession with AI seems to be working. But in the ever-changing tech landscape, only time will tell if this big bet will keep paying off.\nRead Next:\nAmid the ongoing EV revolution, previously overlooked low-income communities now harbor a huge investment opportunity at just $500.\nA billion-dollar investment strategy with minimums as low as $10 \u2014 you can become part of the next big real estate boom today.\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article Mark Zuckerberg's AI Obsession: Is $8 Billion Too Much For Meta To Handle? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "By Katie Paul\n-Meta said on Friday it had identified possible hacking attempts on the WhatsApp accounts of U.S. officials from the administrations of both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, blaming the same Iranian hacker group revealed earlier this month to have compromised the Trump campaign.\nIn a blog post, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp described the attempt as a \"small cluster of likely social engineering activity on WhatsApp\" involving accounts posing as technical support for AOL, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft.\nIt blocked the accounts after users reported the activity as suspicious and had not seen any evidence suggesting the targeted WhatsApp accounts had been compromised, it said.\nMeta attributed the activity to APT42, a hacking group widely believed to be associated with an intelligence division inside Iran's military that is known for placing surveillance software on the mobile phones of its victims. The software enables the team to record calls, steal text messages and silently turn on cameras and microphones, according to researchers who follow the group.\nA spokesman for Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations in New York declined to comment on the Meta allegation specifically, but previously said \"the Iranian government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election.\"\nMeta linked the group's activity to efforts to breach U.S. presidential campaigns reported by Microsoft and Google earlier this month, ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.\nThe company's blog post did not name the individuals targeted, saying only that the hackers \"appeared to have focused on political and diplomatic officials, business and other public figures, including some associated with administrations of President Biden and former President Trump.\"\nThose figures were based in Israel, the Palestinian territories, Iran, the United States and the United Kingdom, it added.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Daniel Wallis)\n"

        "Author": "  Ethan Feller ",
        "Text": "Markets are reeling this morning, but I would implore investors to do everything they can to keep a cool head. While I cannot guarantee that we are at the exact lows of this selloff, there are a number of market leading stocks currently trading at very appealing levels.\nThere has been a confluence of bearish catalysts over the last few days, which we will cover below, but what is most important is that stocks are on sale and the world is not likely to end anytime soon. It can be helpful to take a step back and see that even after this selloff, many stocks and the broad market are still up nicely YTD.\nSome of the greatest stocks and companies have moved considerably off their recent highs such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL) and some of the best ETFs like\u00a0QQQ\u00a0and\u00a0SPY.\nInvestors don\u2019t need to go all in today, but building your watchlist and buying as the volatility falls should be the plan.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhat Happened to the Stock Market?\nLast week was one of the busiest of the year; we saw earnings from many of the big tech companies, there was an FOMC meeting, a weak employment print pointing to a possible recession and a huge policy shift from the Bank of Japan. If there were a period market to correct like it is today, it seems now is the appropriate time.\nSo why did these events cause such a rapid selloff? It started with big tech. At the earnings calls from Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms investors were critical of the huge capex being spent on AI, while none of the companies had much profit to show for it. Fears of an AI bubble percolated, and investors began selling many of the AI darlings.\nIt should be noted that outside of the large capex, these technology companies posted outstanding earnings and still believe in the long-term value of their AI infrastructure spending.\nThen on Friday morning, we saw the second poor employment report of the week. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% and worries of an impending recession spread.\nFinally, the monetary policy out of the Bank of Japan threw the final wrench into this bearish trifecta. Japan has been far behind the other central banks in terms of tightening monetary policy and only just began to hike interest rates last week.\nThe reason why this affected the US stock market is a little complicated, but basically it removed funding for cheap money. What happened is that the carry trade is being unwound. Because interest rates were so low in Japan, investors would borrow money in Yen terms and would take that leveraged money buy stocks and other assets around the world.\nSo essentially, because this funding mechanism is going away, many investors are being margin called on their borrowed money, causing further selling.\nWill Stocks Continue to Fall?\nI lean towards this correction being much closer to the end than the beginning. Although the causes of the selloff are concerning, they are very likely transient. Yes, the unemployment rate jumped, but the US economy shows no additional signs of recession. Furthermore, the Fed is about to start cutting interest rates, which will be a boon for the economy and stock market.\nAs for the Yen carry trade unwind, we are in the midst of it, but that too is being priced into the market right now. Unless there are more systemic issues related to it, then it too will fade.\nAs for AI, I think this catalyst is the most uncertain moving forward. Was it just hype or will it produce the productivity and profit gains it promised? I think it likely will, but it may be over a longer timeline than investors originally thought.\nThe big tech companies are absolutely gushing with profits and are growing their businesses at very impressive rates still. Investors are going to recognize this, and buyers are going to step in.\nLeading Technology Stocks on Sale (Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta)\nAll my favorite stocks are on sale today. Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Meta Platforms are all growing like startups, yet they are trillion-dollar, mammoth companies. Amazon is expected to grow its earnings 30% annually over the next 3-5 years while Meta is expecting 20%. It is a bit slower at Alphabet and Apple, with 17.5% and 12.7% respectively, but those are still great growth rates.\nAll the stocks in the group are also trading at reasonable valuations. AMZN, META and GOOGL are all trading below their 10-year median valuations, with AAPL still trading at a premium.\nHowever, both Apple and Amazon enjoy Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ratings, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. But most notably, all these companies posted truly incredible quarterly earnings results, demonstrating the deep roots of their businesses.\nIf you are an investor that likes simplicity, picking up a technology ETF like Invesco QQQ might be the simplest strategy. It too boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating and has been one of the best performing ETFs in the market over the last 10 years.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBe Greedy and Buy Stocks when Others are Fearful \nEveryone knows the mantra, but when it comes time to be greedy, many investors are paralyzed. All of a sudden investors are talking about waiting for another leg down, but it never comes.\nYes, it can be difficult to step up and buy when it looks like the world is going to end but that\u2019s how you get discounts.\nI will say, don\u2019t try to catch a falling knife. There is nothing wrong with waiting for the volatility to die down and for stocks to start consolidating sideways. But don\u2019t overthink this market environment too much, this appears to be a buying opportunity.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Hottest 10 Stock Picks.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against Jim Cramer's other stock picks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer talked about what he sees as Wall Street's biggest oversights this earnings season, especially on a day when the Dow dropped 141 points, and the NASDAQ advanced 0.2%. Cramer highlighted the misleading narratives surrounding the impact of GLP-1 drugs on food and beverage companies, the reluctance to lower prices post-pandemic, the skepticism around AI investments, and the persistent belief that\nIntel remains dominant in the tech sector.\nCramer argues that if companies were more honest about their changing situations, they would gain credibility and potentially boost their stock prices. Instead, by withholding important details, they leave investors confused and more likely to make poor decisions.\n\"If companies just own up to their own changing circumstances, things would be so much easier for everybody. But who wants to admit mistakes? They earn a lot of credibility for themselves leading the higher stock prices down the line, instead their stocks languish as investors try to assess what's really going on and they presume the worst not the best.\" said Cramer.\nIn a time filled with so much misinformation, Cramer emphasized how easy it is to be misled and underscored the need to recognize these gaps. According to Cramer, despite approximately 20 million Americans reportedly using GLP-1 weight loss and diabetes drugs, food and beverage companies refuse to acknowledge any negative impact of these medications. They won\u2019t even suggest it. Cramer argues that their denial of the effects of GLP-1 drugs is simply untrue.\n\"We know that people eat much less when they take these GLP-1s and consume less snack food because it tamps down on cravings. ...These drugs are incredibly powerful. The idea they aren't doing damage to the snack food companies is insane.\"\nCramer commented on the rising prices, stating that most companies see no need to lower them, despite significant hikes during the pandemic. He pointed out that airlines, which have consistently underperformed, refuse to reduce fares, behaving as if the price hikes never happened.\n\"In the airlines, there are endless underperformers, they simply wouldn't roll back prices, they act as if they didn't even take them up in the first place.\"\nThe same goes for hotels and entertainment venues, which sharply increased prices during the pandemic and now resist lowering them, even as demand forecasts decline. Cramer also noted that many restaurants either claim their price hikes haven't hurt sales or refuse to acknowledge the need to roll back prices.\n\"They raised prices drastically during the pandemic. They won't cap the raising prices too much even as the forecast is coming down hard.\"\nDiscussing AI, Cramer strongly disagrees with Wall Street's claim that AI investments are a waste of money. He points out that many believe big companies spending heavily on AI-related video chips aren't seeing any significant returns, and are only investing to keep up with competitors (see 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To).\n\"We're constantly being told that none of the big companies spending a fortune in video chips for AI has seen any meaningful return on that investment. They're only doing it to prevent their competitors from getting an edge. That's what we keep on hearing. That's absurd!\"\nCramer also challenged the common belief that INTC remains a leader in its sector. He dismissed claims that the company is poised for a major comeback, particularly in data centers, and that it has a chip capable of rivaling its competitors' dominance. He pointed out that the company's financial health tells a different story, citing the company's decision to cut its dividend last year and suspend the remainder this year. According to Cramer, these actions don't signal dominance, and he warned that this is not the same semiconductor company it once was, despite what the company might claim.\n\"I keep hearing that Intel's gonna make a huge comeback that is catching up the others in the data center. That the data center has an Nvidia killer in GE-3. That it's using the chips to sack money from you and further it's dominance. Dream on! Have you seen Intel's balance sheet? Can you read one? Do you think a company that cut its dividend last year and then suspends what was left of it this year in order to assert its dominance?! Look, this is not the Intel of old even though we want it to be. Despite Intel's protestations, I wouldn't want to be Intel's partner.\"\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors:165\nJim Cramer pointed out that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) isn't just purchasing video chips for AI out of general concern about competition. Instead, they're particularly worried that Meta might overtake them, and Cramer believes this concern is justified.\n\"Google aren't buying because they're worried that the other guys might do something. They're specifically worried that Meta is going to catch and pass them and they should be.\"\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s leadership in artificial intelligence (AI), along with its seamless integration of AI into its products\u2014ranging from search and advertising to cloud services and hardware\u2014positions the company for sustained growth. The stability of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s financial health is underpinned by its search advertising, which continues to be a major revenue source.\nFurthermore, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\u2019s extensive ecosystem, including Android, Chrome, Google Maps, and YouTube, enhances user engagement and drives revenue growth through its interconnected services. In Q2 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported $85 billion in revenue, a 14% year-over-year increase, largely driven by a 29% rise in Google Cloud revenue to $10.35 billion.\nCooper Investors Global Equities Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cUnsurprisingly the portfolio\u2019s best performers in the very short term reflect this pattern, having narrowed to those most obviously exposed to the AI story \u2013 TSMC and\u00a0Alphabet Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:GOOG). While the portfolio has owned semiconductor companies for years it remains diversified and is underweight the group from an active risk perspective, dragging on relative performance in the last six months. The portfolio is currently positioned to take advantage of the Value Latency we see in smaller sized companies, and the performance of the quarter has been more aligned with those factors.\nOverall GOOG ranks 4th on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 13, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Palantir PLTR, Morgan Stanley MS, Merch MRK, Paypal PYPL and Meta Platforms META.\nPalantir is a unique and highly secretive company specializing in software, security, and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. The company's largest customers are government and financial institutions. Government use cases include counterterrorism, intelligence analysis, and security and privacy.\nPalantir Gotham is Palantir's software used for intelligence and defense purposes for counter terrorism efforts. The United States Intelligence Community (USIC) and the Department of Defense (DoD) are among its largest clients.\nThe ongoing conflicts are increasing globally, especially in Europe and the Middle East. Even if the U.S. is not directly involved in these conflicts, our indirect involvement will keep the revenue flowing from the U.S. government.\nFor example, the war between Ukraine and Russia appears to be escalating as Ukraine is going on the offensive and crossing the border into Russia. Over the weekend, a Ukrainian nuclear plant caught on fire. Meanwhile, Israeli forces intercepted projectiles crossing from Lebanon last night. The wars are escalating so rapidly that the U.S. has deployed a nuclear-powered submarine to the Middle East.\n2023 military spending was the highest on record for the United States. To put the rampant expenditures into perspective, the U.S. spent $916 billion for the year, more than the next highest nine countries combined.\nThough counterterrorism and defense are Palantir's bread and butter, the company offers services that cater to big name clients such as Morgan Stanley and Merch. These services include:\nPalantir helps organizations integrate vast and diverse datasets from various sources. PLTR's software is known for handling massive volumes of data while simultaneously making connections between disparate data sets. In other words, the company helps organizations simplify and make sense of complex data sets. The company's software is highly coveted because it transforms the data into interactive visualizations.\nBecause of its high-level clientele, Palantir is well known for its best-in-breed security measures.\nPalantir's AI and machine learning capabilities enable customers to apply advanced predictive analytics to their data findings.\nThough Palantir is highly secretive, a 2013 TechCrunch report divulged that Palantir's has at least twelve clients within the U.S. government, including the CDC and the FBI. With either side of the aisle unwilling to reign in government spending, being a government contractor like PLTR is an excellent place to be.\nThe \"Paypal Mafia\" refers to a group of Paypal employees and founders who became successful entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and executives in the technology industry. Peter Thiel, a founding member of Palantir, is one of the best-known and successful of the bunch. Thiel was the first outside investor in Meta Platforms, formerly, Facebook. Having a solid founding team should act as a vote of confidence for prospective investors.\nLast week, Palantir reported earnings that grew 23% year-over-year. PLTR is one of the best growth stories in the market. The company has grown its top and bottom lines at a double-digit clip since December 2022.\nPalantir is one of the best growth stories on Wall Street. The company should be a big beneficiary of rising geopolitical tensions and rampant government spending.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Text": "-Facebook owner Meta Platforms struck a deal to buy geothermal power from Sage Geosystems to supply its U.S. data centers, it said on Monday, as it races to build out the infrastructure to support its massive investments in energy-hungry artificial intelligence.\nThe first phase of the 150-megawatt project should be operational by 2027 and \"significantly\" expand the use of geothermal power in the United States, the social media company said. The location has yet to be determined, but the companies said it will be east of the Rocky Mountains.\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nGeothermal power is a renewable energy source that uses the Earth's internal heat to produce electricity and heat water. One-hundred and fifty megawatts is roughly enough electricity to power 38,000 homes.\nMeta's announcement, made as part of a U.S. Department of Energy event on geothermal development, comes as President Joe Biden's administration is asking big technology companies to invest in new clean power generation to cover their surging electricity demand.\nThat surge has been driven by the adoption of technologies like generative AI that require large amounts of electricity to power data centers, a development that could complicate Biden's target of decarbonizing the power sector by 2035 to fight climate change.\nSage, which is based in Houston, is a four-year-old startup developing next-generation technology that it says can be deployed in more locations than traditional geothermal, which requires naturally occurring underground reservoirs of hot water and accounts for 0.4% of U.S. power generation.\nThe company is backed by oil and gas firms Chesapeake Energy and Nabors Industries and venture capital firms Virya and Helium-3 Ventures.\nThe project for Meta would be Sage's largest to date by far. The company said it first validated the technology in the field just two years ago.\nA Meta spokesperson told Reuters the company expected the Sage Geosystems energy to feed the power grid, rather than directly supplying any specific data center.\nMeta has been scrambling to overhaul and build out infrastructure to accommodate its push into generative AI for the last several years, refashioning its data centers to support the types of chips best suited to AI workloads.\nThat AI push has caused the company's expenses to spike. Last month, Meta forecast 2024 capital expenditure would come in between $37 billion and $40 billion, while cautioning that infrastructure costs would continue to be a \"significant driver\" of expense growth in 2025.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York and Nichola Groom in New YorkEditing by Matthew Lewis)\n"

Capital expenditures of $8.47 billion were below LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of $9.51 billion.\nOperating income climbed 58%\u00a0to\u00a0$14.9 billion as operating margin expanded from last year\u2019s comparable quarter when it amounted to 29% to 38%.\nNet income jumped 73% to $13.47 billion\u00a0with earnings of $5.16 a share surpassing LSEG\u2019s consensus estimate of $4.73 per share.\nMeta expects current quarter revenue in the range between\u00a0$38.5 billion and $41 billion.\nAI-related developments\nMeta AI, which rivals offerings from Microsoft-backed (NASDAQ: MSFT)\u00a0OpenAI and Alphabet-owned Google is stated to be on track to become the most used AI assistant by the end of the year.\u00a0But, monetizing this tool will take time.\nWith its AI offerings, Meta also aims to make its core business, advertising, more effective, using these tools to improve ad performance and the overall user experience.\nAfter recently unveiling its most capable open-source AI model yet,\u00a0Llama 3.1\u00a0\u00a0as part of its AI push, Zuckerberg revealed Meta is already working on Llama 4, which it ambitiously aims to become \"the most advanced in the industry next year.\" This speed of development emphasizes\u00a0\u00a0Meta\u2019s determination to ensure that its technology is on par with\u00a0\u00a0that of rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google.\nHeavy AI infrastructure spending to avoid being late.\nLike Google, Microsoft and other tech peers, Meta boosted spending to invest in AI infrastructure, raising concerns about whether these massive costs will pay off.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0Meta CFO Susan Li revealed Meta expects significant CapEx growth in 2025.\u00a0But Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shares the reasoning with Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, prefering to risk building capacity before it is needed, rather than risk being too late.\nMeta\u2019s financials continue to benefit from cost-cutting efforts that Meta kicked off in late 2022. But the highlight of the report was undoubtedly the AI spending spree.\u00a0Although Meta also needs to prove its ambitious AI visions are worth the investment, like Google, Meta is delivering when it comes revenue growth and earnings beats, which is undoutebtedly easing investor concerns.\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently published a list of 17 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe AI industry continues to be highly dynamic, with significant growth anticipated across various sectors in 2024. The expansion of generative AI, which saw exponential growth in 2023, is expected to continue this year, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value as businesses move from pilot projects to broader implementation. This shift suggests that 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI as companies aim to leverage capabilities more fully to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate across different industries. The market for generative AI is forecasted to grow rapidly, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 60%, reaching a valuation of around $37 billion by 2028. This growth is fueled by the widespread adoption of AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and Billionaire Druckenmiller is Betting on AI\nThe AI revolution is already transforming operations across the world by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and enhancing predictive capabilities. The healthcare sector, for example, is poised for substantial advancements due to AI, with the market expected to grow to around $188 billion by 2030, driven by innovations in genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. Edge computing is another area likely to see significant development in 2024, as it becomes increasingly critical for enabling AI applications that require real-time data processing. The move towards edge computing, where data is processed closer to the source, is expected to reduce latency and improve the performance of AI systems, particularly in sectors like autonomous vehicles, IoT, and industrial automation.\nThis trend underscores the growing importance of a robust semiconductor supply chain, especially as global trade tensions and geopolitical events continue to impact the availability of critical components like chips. Experts also emphasize the growing importance of ethical considerations and responsible AI. As AI technologies become more deeply embedded in various aspects of society, concerns around privacy, bias, and security are likely to intensify, prompting calls for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. The rapid growth will also bring challenges related to talent acquisition, supply chain management, and the need for responsible AI practices. As such, the industry is likely to be marked by both tremendous opportunities and complex challenges in the near term.\nREAD ALSO 10 Best Small-Cap AI Stocks to Buy and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nMeta App 3D sign\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. A few weeks after announcing that spending on AI and related tech would inch higher in the coming months, the company has revealed plans to shut down an augmented reality (AR) studio to focus investments in other areas. In a recent post, the firm said that the decision is part of a plan to shift resources to the next generation of experiences, across new form factors like glasses.\nEarlier this week, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) announced that it had signed a deal with Sage Geosystems to receive geothermal energy to support AI data centers in the US. The first phase of this project is expected to be online and operating in 2027. The firm has committed to investing in sustainable energy as the demand for power rises across the US. Meta has contracted over 12,000 MW in renewable energy projects over the past few years.\nOverall, META ranks 4th\u00a0on our list of our list of trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) -Meta Platforms' Instagram failed to remove abusive comments aimed at female politicians who are potential candidates for the 2024 U.S. elections, according to a report by the non-profit Center for Countering Digital Hate on Wednesday.\nThe report analyzed over half a million comments on Instagram posts by five Democratic and five Republican women politicians, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris, Senator Marsha Blackburn and Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene.\nCCDH flagged over 20,000 comments as \"toxic,\" with 1,000 of these comments containing sexist and racist abuse, as well as death and rape threats. Instagram left up 93% of the harmful comments even after breaching the platform's standards.\nIn response to the report, Meta said it has tools in place for users to control comments on their posts, including filtering out offensive comments, phrases or emojis.\n\"We will review the CCDH report and take action on any content that violates our policies,\" said Cindy Southworth, head of women's safety at Meta.\nIn its analysis of the 2020 U.S. election, the CCDH report found that women of color were more likely to be targets of sexist and racist abuse.\nThe rise of online abuse against women politicians has drawn criticism from advocacy groups.\nIt also highlighted how social media algorithms that prioritize emotional content and engagement can inadvertently amplify this abuse, a feature that politicians often leverage to boost their engagement rates.\nThis underscores the role social media platforms and their algorithms play in the propagation of online abuse, a problem that extends beyond the political sphere and affects millions of users worldwide.\nThe report urged social media platforms to enforce their safety guidelines more effectively and take decisive action against targeted online abuse.\n(Reporting by Priyanka.G and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; editing by Alan Barona)\n"

        "Title": "Markets Close Higher Following Powell Presser; META, QCOM, ETSY Report",
        "Author": "  Mark Vickery ",
        "Text": "Wednesday, July 31st, 2024Markets closed higher today, in the wake of the latest Fed meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference this afternoon, gave no surprises to the market. What it did was allow speculation to continue that rate cuts are indeed on the horizon. The Dow closed +99 points, +0.24%, while the Nasdaq zoomed up +451 points, +2.64%. The S&P 500 and small-cap Russell 2000 were +1.58% and +0.51%, respectively.The Fed\u2019s press release following the meeting generated no significant waves. In fact, it read fairly boiler-plate, much along the lines of press releases throughout the year explaining that the Fed is keeping interest rates at 5.25-5.50% \u2014 where they\u2019ve now been for exactly one year. \u201cThe economy is expanding at a solid pace\u2026 nominal wage growth has eased\u2026\u201d said Powell. The Fed remains committed to its 2% inflation goal \u2014 not 2.5% or 2.6%, apparently, as we saw in last week\u2019s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data.Clearly the Fed feels they can afford seven more weeks of dwindling labor market and inflation data. PCE results are still half a point above the optimal inflation rate, but today\u2019s private-sector payrolls from Automatic Data Processing (ADP) showed only 122K jobs filled this month \u2014 basically the amount of replacement hires needed to cover all the monthly retirees. Powell did get a bit of pushback from reporters about the severity of the current labor situation, but he said, \u201cI feel good about where we are,\u201d and \u201cthe totality of data\u201d will determine rate levels.On the issue of a September cut, Powell was noncommittal. After taking a break in August, the next FOMC meeting is scheduled for September 17-18 \u2014 seven weeks from now. Powell put to rest any political considerations, considering this next meeting will be itself seven weeks prior to the General Election. \u201cIt\u2019s coming to be time to adjust (interest rates),\u201d Powell said. On whether we may see a 50-basis-point (bps) cut instead of 25 bps, he said the Fed was not thinking 50, but not ruling it out either.Meanwhile, Meta Platforms META posted a strong Q2 beat this afternoon. The parent of Facebook, Instagram and What\u2019sApp generated earnings of $5.16 per share on quarterly revenues of $39.04 billion, outpacing expectations of $4.70 per share and $38.24 billion, respectively. Operating margins came in at +38%. Daily Active People (formerly Daily Active Users) grew to 3.27 billion, Average Price per Ad gained +10% year over year, and the company has Cash and Equivalents of a whopping $58.08 billion. Revenue guidance was upped to $38.5-41 billion, even with a forex headwind of +2%.Qualcomm QCOM recorded beats in its fiscal Q3 report after the close. Earnings of $2.33 per share surpassed estimates of $2.25 (and well ahead of the $1.87 per share from the year-ago quarter), with revenues of $9.4 billion outpacing the $9.23 billion expected. Guidance of $2.45-2.65 earnings per share and $9.5-10.3 billion in sales were ratcheted up from the $2.44 per share and $9.70 billion from the Zacks consensus. It also posted a fourth-straight record high in auto chip sales. QCOM shares are up +5% in the after-market.Etsy ETSY posted a mixed Q2 late Wednesday. That said, revenues and Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS) are more important for Etsy\u2019s business than straight earnings, which missed estimates by 5 cents to 41 cents per share. Revenues grew admirably to $647.8 million from $633.5 million projected, though GMS reached $2.9 billion, -2.1% year over year. Gifting GMS grew +4.1% from a year ago.

        "Title": "Lone Echo developer Ready at Dawn has reportedly been closed by Meta",
        "Author": "  Andy Chalk ",
        "Text": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\nReady at Dawn, the developer of The Order: 1866 and the Lone Echo VR games, has reportedly been closed by parent company Meta. An Android Central report says the studio's closure comes as part of an effort to meet budget reductions, reported in July, at the company's Reality Labs VR division.\nReady at Dawn was founded in 2003 and developed games for various PlayStation platforms until shifting focus to VR development with the 2017 release of Lone Echo for the Oculus Rift. A standalone multiplayer spinoff called Echo VR followed, but despite being a notable success in the VR market it was closed in August 2023, ostensibly so the studio could \"focus on our next project.\"\nBut there was no next project: Ready at Dawn's most recent release was Lone Echo 2, which came out in 2021, the year after the studio was acquired by Meta.\nThe number of people affected by the studio closure hasn't been revealed, but Meta reportedly said the number isn't high enough to trigger California's Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act, which applies to workforces of 50 or more employees. Ready at Dawn had previously been impacted by deep layoffs at Meta that occurred in 2023.\nMeta's Reality Labs division has for years been bleeding money at a rate that would be sustainable for about 10 minutes in any kind of sane world: Nearly $50 billion lost over the past four years. Will shuttering one of the few game studios that seemed able to do something interesting with VR turn those fortunes around? I'm going to say probably not: I don't know how much Ready at Dawn employees were making but I'd guess it was a pretty small slice of the nearly $9 billion Reality Labs is estimated to have lost over the first six months of 2024.\nI've reached out to Meta for comment on the reported closure and will update if I receive a reply.\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 8, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \" The overall picture that has emerged out of the Q2 earnings season is one of stability and an improving earnings outlook, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality.\"\nNote: The following is an excerpt from this week\u2019sEarnings Trends\u00a0report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods,\u00a0please click here>>>\nHere are the key points:\nThe overall picture that has emerged out of the Q2 earnings season is one of stability and an improving earnings outlook, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality. That said, estimates for the current period have started to weaken faster than we saw in the last two periods.\nFor the 431 S&P 500 companies that have reported Q2 results, or 86.2% of the index\u2019s total membership, total earnings are up +10.6% from the same period last year on +5.2% higher revenues, with 79.8% beating EPS estimates and 59.2% beating revenue estimates.\nFor 2024 Q3, total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +4.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway, with the current +4.7% earnings growth pace down from +6.9% in early July.\nQ2 earnings for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 companies are expected to be up +33.5% from the same period last year on +14.3% higher revenues. Excluding the \u2018Mag 7\u2019, Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +6.2% (from +11.0%).\nThe \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 stocks - Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA \u2013 have been in the spotlight in the ongoing market turmoil. This followed these companies\u2019 Q2 quarterly releases that mostly failed to impress market participants, particularly the reports from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla.\nAs we noted in this space recently, the market\u2019s issue with the Mag 7 companies\u2019 quarterly reports wasn\u2019t so much their current earnings or outlooks for the coming periods but rather with their ever-rising capex levels that are going towards AI projects. Market participants would like to see a clearer monetization path for these AI investments, but management teams have generally been unable to provide that level of visibility.\nWe don\u2019t see elevated capex by Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, or any other Tech operator as an issue. After all, these investments will ensure that these companies remain at the cutting edge of this evolving new business opportunity.\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, we now have Q2 earnings from all but Nvidia, which is scheduled to report on August 28th. For the group as a whole, combining the actual results from the six companies that have reported already with estimates for Nvidia, total Q2 earnings are on track to be up +33.5% on +14.3% higher revenues.\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +20.6% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.5%, followed by another strong showing expected next year. A big contributing factor to the Tech sector\u2019s positive earnings outlook is the sector\u2019s margins outlook.\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year\u2019s record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector\u2019s productivity.\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.7% from the same period last year on +4.7% higher revenues. Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway.\nThis is a bigger decline to estimates relative to the comparable periods for the two preceding quarters. The negative revisions trend is widespread and not concentrated in one or two sectors, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut over this period. The Tech and Finance sectors are the only ones enjoying positive estimate revisions over this period.\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +8.4% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +8.1%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.2%. In other words, about half of this year\u2019s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "Text": "This story was originally published on Utility Dive. To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Utility Dive newsletter.\nRecommended Reading \nAEP data center and other commercial sales soar 12.4% in Q2\nXcel Energy has a pipeline of 6.7 GW of new data center projects in the works, Xcel\u00a0President and CEO Bob Frenzel said during the company's second quarter earnings call on Thursday.\nAlthough the company is still crunching the numbers, Frenzel said Xcel\u00a0will likely need need additional transmission and generation assets in order to meet this new demand.\nThe company also spent $1.7 billion on resilient and reliable energy infrastructure during the second quarter in order to address wildfire risk. Xcel\u00a0is still working through claims and lawsuits related to wildfires in Texas and Colorado in 2021 and 2024.\nEnormous new electrical demand is an industry-wide trend, but Xcel\u00a0could attract a disproportionate share of the new load on account of its low energy costs and the availability of water, fiber infrastructure, and open land within its service territory, Frenzel said.\nThe company experienced a \u201cmaterial shift\u201d in electrical demand during the second quarter as the company lined up new data center prospects, Frenzel said, including already-announced deals with Meta and Microsoft in Minnesota and QTS Realty Trust in Colorado.\nNearly half of the company's total growth is now coming from tech companies seeking contracts for new data centers, Frenzel said. The other half is coming from a combination of electric vehicles, the electrification of oil and gas production and other industries, and from economic growth.\nIf all these contracts come to fruition, the growth in demand could exceed 9% per year, Frenzel said,\u00a0though Xcel\u00a0CFO Brian Van Able said the company is still in the planning process for these new projects and that more solid numbers would not be available until the third quarter.\nRealistically, Xcel\u00a0does not have 6 GW in spare capacity and so the company will likely need to issue requests for proposals and update its resource plans to add generation in response to growing demand, Frenzel said. The company will also need to look at building new transmission to meet demand, he said.\nMeanwhile, Xcel\u00a0spent $1.7 billion on wildfire mitigation as the company continues to grapple with the fallout from the 2021 Marshall Fire in Colorado and the February 2024 Smokehouse Creek Fire in northeastern Texas and western Oklahoma. Xcel has so far settled 45 of 141 claims related to the Smokehouse Creek Fire, and faces 21 lawsuits associated with that fire, Van Able said.\nAccording to Van Able,\u00a0the company does not expect its liability for this fire to exceed its $500 million insurance policy, as most of the claims stemming from the fire involve agricultural losses.\nIn Colorado, where the company faces hundreds of lawsuits stemming from the $2 billion Marshall Fire, Xcel\u00a0recently filed a second wildfire mitigation plan with initiatives to improve the company's situational awareness, improve weather and fire forecasting, and to deploy new monitoring technologies including AI-enabled cameras.\nThe company has conducted proactive public safety power shutoffs during recent high-risk events in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico, Frenzel said.\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 August 15, 2024\u2013 Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \"Looking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the index are expected to be up +9.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% in the first quarter of 2022.\"\nNote: The following is an excerpt from this week's Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\nHere are the key points:\nThe overall picture that has emerged out of the Q2 earnings season is one of a stable and improving earnings outlook, with management teams generally providing a reassuring view of the economic ground reality. That said, estimates for the current period have started to weaken faster than we saw in the last two periods.\nLooking at Q2 as a whole, total earnings for the index are expected to be up +9.4% from the same period last year on +5.4% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth pace since the +10% in the first quarter of 2022.\nFor 2024 Q3, total S&P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +4.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues. Estimates for the period have been coming down since the quarter got underway, with the current +4.3% earnings growth pace down from +6.9% in early July.\nThe Q3 negative revisions trend is far bigger than what we had seen in the comparable periods of the preceding two quarters. Estimates have come down for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines in the Energy, Medical, Transportation, and Business Services sectors. Estimates for the Tech and Finance sectors have gone up.\nThe 'Magnificent 7' stocks - Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Meta Platforms META, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA \u2013 were in the spotlight in the recent market turmoil. This followed these companies' Q2 quarterly releases that mostly failed to impress market participants, particularly the reports from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Tesla.\nAs we noted in this space recently, the market's issue with the Mag 7 companies' quarterly reports wasn't so much their current earnings or outlooks for the coming periods but rather with their ever-rising capex levels that are going towards AI projects. Market participants would like to see a clearer monetization path for these AI investments, but management teams have generally been unable to provide that level of visibility.\nWe don't see elevated capex by Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, or any other Tech operator as an issue. After all, these investments will ensure that these companies remain at the cutting edge of this evolving new business opportunity.\nFor the Mag 7 group as a whole, we now have Q2 earnings from all but Nvidia, which is scheduled to report on August 28th. For the group as a whole, combining the actual results from the six companies that have reported already with estimates for Nvidia, total Q2 earnings are on track to be up +33.4% on +14.3% higher revenues.\nBeyond the Mag 7, Q2 earnings for the Tech sector as a whole are expected to be up +20.6% from the same period last year. The revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.6%, followed by another strong showing expected next year.\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year's record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector's productivity.\nFor the current period (2024 Q3), total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +4.3% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues. Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway.\nThis is a bigger decline to estimates relative to the comparable periods for the two preceding quarters. The negative revisions trend is widespread and not concentrated in one or two sectors, with estimates for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors getting cut over this period. The Tech and Finance sectors are the only ones enjoying positive estimate revisions over this period.\nPlease note that this year's +8.1% earnings growth on only +1.8% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace changes to +7.8%, and the revenue growth rate improves to +4.2%. In other words, about half of this year's earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\nOn the margins front, 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Finance, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nFollow us on Twitter:\u00a0 https://twitter.com/zacksresearch\nJoin us on Facebook:\u00a0 https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/\nZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.
