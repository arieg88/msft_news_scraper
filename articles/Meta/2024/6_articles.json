It\u2019s more than evident now that just a handful of technology companies account for most of the gains in the market, thanks to the AI-fueled rally that is favoring only those companies that are leading in the AI arms race.

The analyst said this dominance comes at the expense of other sectors as funds cut their exposure to cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and discretionary to go overweight on tech.\nBillionaire Steve Cohen\u2019s New AI Fund\nBillionaires and VCs are now planning to create their own AI-focused funds to attract money from investors and tap into the unprecedented opportunities unlocked by AI.

        "Text": "We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. Since Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 5th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0Israel Englander\u00a0is one of the most notable hedge fund managers in America. He founded Millennium Management back in 1989. Today, the fund\u2019s portfolio is worth over $234 billion. Englander nabbed the top spot in Bloomberg\u2019s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2023, with a whopping $2.8 billion in net earnings including gains from personal investments and fees. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Izzy Englander\u2019s Millennium Management earned $600 million from commodities investments last year. However, in a separate report, the publication said despite installing a new chief of its commodities and making big changes, Millennium\u2019s commodities business is lagging behind Citadel (of billionaire Ken Griffin) which made a whopping $8 billion from commodities in 2022. Bloomberg said, citing sources, that part of the reason why Millennium is struggling to post big gains is billionaire Englander\u2019s imposition of \u201ctight guardrails\u201d to limit losses. \u00a0To make money in the commodities business, experts say, you have to take risks and give some freedom to traders. But Englander likes to be in control. \u00a0A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices. Yet Englander owns 100% of the firm.\nThe report said, citing a person who works at the fund, that this major concentration is \u201cnot a good idea.\u201d\nThe FT report said Englander\u2019s fund was up 8.3% in 2023 through October, while it returned 12.5% in 2022,\u00a0 13.6% in 2021 and an impressive 25.9% in 2020.\nFor this article, we scanned Millennium Management\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund\u2019s top 10 holdings.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): One of the Best Growth Stocks According to Ray Dalio?",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other growth stocks.\nRay Dalio is one of the most successful investors in Wall Street's history. He has invested through his firm Bridgewater Associates, and according to Insider Monkey's research, Bridgewater had a 13F portfolio worth $19.7 billion as of Q1 2024 end. What's more, is that we also looked at the top hedge funds on Wall Street as part of our coverage of 23 Best Hedge Funds of All Time and discovered that Bridgewater Associates ranked in the top five due to its $30 billion in gains since inception.\nLooking at these, it's clear that Dalio and his firm must be doing at least something right. Ray Dalio is a macro player who not only loves to look at the broader trends that affect the economy, but he also loves diversification and selling stocks at the right time. This approach differs from several other hedge funds which choose to focus on specific companies or are proponents of buying and holding stocks for the long term. Dalio's strategy allows his fund to manage a changing economic and investment climate, as part of what is dubbed an All Weather Strategy.\nHowever, despite his success, 2024 has been a mixed year for Bridgewater Associates. The firm, currently headed by CEO Nir Bar Dea, is currently shaking things up as its Pure Alpha fund has lost 4% for the last four years. This fund also had one of its worst years in history in 2023, but the changes do appear to be making their mark. This is because in Q1, the fund posted 16% in returns which were higher than the 4.59% in gains made by global hedge funds.\nAs for Dalio, even though he has moved forward from directly overseeing Bridgewater's affairs, the investment guru regularly shares his wisdom with the world. He started 2024 by listing five key forces that will play a dominant theme in the investment environment this year. In a LinkedIn post, the billionaire shared that these forces are those that determine how the economy, the American and global political systems, forces of nature, and humanity's innovation work.\nWhile these forces are important for 2024, Dalio's life's work has focused on studying them over the course of the years and analyzing how they match similar trends in history. This makes his investment approach one of the most unique ones in the industry, and it appears to be yielding results as between 1991 and 2022, Bridgewater's Pure Alpha fund has delivered 11.4% in average annual returns.\nDalio is also one of the few investors in the world who takes a serious approach to studying history and understanding the implications on the broader investing environment. Ever eager to share his insights, the famed investor gave a talk at Columbia Business School in April. Commenting on the investment approach at Bridgewater, the billionaire shared his values, philosophy, and guiding beacons for the process. He started out by sharing that he began his career by trading commodities because they had low margin requirements which would let him make more money. The stock market crash of 1982, which forced Dalio to borrow $4,000 from his father to pay bills was also critical in formulating his investment approach. As we've mentioned above, diversification is a key theme of Dalio's All Weather Strategy, and the market crash influenced this approach:\nAnd the way I looked at the risk, is I said, it's like I, I, had a visual image that there's this jungle there. And if I can cross the jungle without getting killed to the other side I would be okay. But I have to go through that, and then, or I could stay on the safe life side. And not take those risks. And how would I do that? And that was a problem that I had to figure out. And I realized two things I needed to do. I needed to diversify because it's like my 15 uncorrelated returns stream mantra. I've realized that if I can have debts, 15 good uncorrelated return streams that I could reduce my risk by 80% with keeping the same expected returns.\nFinally, before we get to Ray Dalio's top growth stock picks, it's also important to understand why such stocks are important particularly in today's investment environment. US economic growth slowed down to 1.6% in Q1 from 2.4% in Q4 2023. At the same time, while the stock market has flourished on the AI front, other sectors have shown that persistently high inflation and tight credit conditions are making their mark. Since the economy is the sum product goods and services produced, firms whose revenue growth outpaces the consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 3.3% for May and the GDP growth are adding more customers to their top line instead of simply matching economic trends. Combining such stocks with the investment principles of the legendary Ray Dalio can help gain a better understanding of some of the market's top sectors.\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the top growth stocks that Ray Dalio and Bridgewater Associates have invested in.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of Ray Dalio's top growth stocks, we analyzed Bridgewater Associate's 13F filings for Q1 2024 and picked out ten stocks with strong fiscal year annual revenue growth among the top 80 stocks.\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nLatest Fiscal Year Annual Growth Rate: 15.69%\nBridgewater Associates' Q1 2024 Investment: $482 million\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) needs no introduction due to the near ubiquity of its social media products. Its size and heft, aided by a large user base, means that the firm has to continuously think of unique ways to increase user engagement on Facebook and Instagram. The more time users spend on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s platforms, the more money the firm can earn through advertisers, which are often eager to work with it due to the sizeable user base. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has also kept itself abreast with the latest technology trends by not only competing at the high end of the artificial intelligence industry through its Llama AI model but by also integrating AI features into its platform to drive consumer engagement. This makes Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) an early mover in integrating AI into social media, and the only headwinds that it can face are a slowdown in ad spending due to economic weakness or regulatory action against its heft.\nBaron Funds mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\nShares of Meta Platforms, Inc., the world\u2019s largest social network, rose 37.3% in the quarter due to robust fourth quarter top-line growth of 25% year-over-year with operating margins more than doubling year-over-year to 41%, benefiting from the year of efficiency12 as Meta\u2019s headcount was down 22% year-over-year (note that the profitability of the core business is even stronger as Reality Labs\u2019 losses of over $4.5 billion in the quarter are included in the overall operating income metric). Meta also guided for first- quarter revenue growth of approximately 29% year-over-year, which was better than expected. Advertiser satisfaction and adoption of Meta remains strong, core app engagement is healthy with video daily watch time up 25% year-over-year and the total number of monthly active users up 6% year-on-year to 3.98 billion in the fourth quarter, and Instagram Reels and click-to-message ads monetization continues to improve. Meta also continues to rapidly innovate in GenAI, with its leading research lab releasing widely adopted open-source models (e.g., Llama 2), and internal algorithms and core apps becoming augmented with AI (e.g., Meta\u2019s recommendation engine). We remain shareholders and believe Meta can sustain its leading market share in digital advertising thanks to strong network effects enabled by its massive user and advertiser base. Additionally, we believe the company\u2019s innovative culture, large installed base, and leading GenAI research should enable it to embed AI and GenAI into its offerings with further monetization opportunities ahead. For example, AI agents could help scale business messaging, handling a large volume of customer requests on behalf of business customers, making business messaging at scale more viable.\nOverall META ranks 8th on our list of the best growth stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio. You can visit 10 Best Growth Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Ray Dalio to see the other growth stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nThe second half of 2024 is here and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve remain elusive, with warnings about valuations and AI-led market hype growing louder. A number of notable Wall Street analysts have recently warned that the markets remains more concentrated than ever where just a few stocks account for most of the gains, thanks to their dominance in the AI industry. Many also believe the market is up for a correction as it has entered the overbought territory.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 6.8% over the last month. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company\u2019s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Meta Platforms'  ROE.\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n View our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Meta Platforms is:\n31% = US$46b \u00f7 US$150b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.31 in profit.\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don\u2019t share these attributes.\nFirst thing first, we like that Meta Platforms has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 7.4% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for Meta Platforms' moderate 11% net income growth seen over the past five years.\nWe then compared Meta Platforms' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 6.0% in the same 5-year period.\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is META worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether META is currently mispriced by the market.\nMeta Platforms has a low three-year median payout ratio of 2.8%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 97% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.\nUpon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 9.2% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 23% over the same period.\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Meta Platforms' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

        "Author": "  David Jagielski, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Want proof that investors have short memories? Just look at the stock of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). This year, it's one of the hottest companies in the market, rising by 45% after already climbing 194% in 2023. But in 2022, it was in a brutal tailspin, losing 64% of its value as many investors were convinced it was going to continue going lower.\nSuch is the investing world these days where fear can convince investors that a stock is headed for zero, and a new trend in tech can set its trajectory back toward the moon the next day. The truth, as is usually the case, lies somewhere in the middle. Meta isn't the do-no-wrong stock it is today, nor was it the complete and utter failure that it looked like in 2022.\nStill, the stock's elevated $1.3 trillion valuation makes it overdue for a sell-off. Here are three reasons to avoid Meta stock right now.\nVarious governments are starting to scrutinize social media much closer as parents and the general public grow concerned its potential adverse effects on young kids. The U.S. Surgeon General this month called for a warning label on social media platforms because of their mental health risks.\nNew York's Gov. Kathy Hochul recently signed legislation called the SAFE for Kids Act (with SAFE standing for Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation). The law looks to prevent apps from sending notifications between midnight and 6 a.m. The companies behind them might also need to adjust their algorithms so that users under the age of 18 are not seeing so-called \"addictive feeds.\"\nMore scrutiny is also being paid to so-called fake news, to mental health issues, and to other issues deemed to be destructive to users of social media. And when the term social media is used, many people's first thoughts go to popular apps like Meta's Instagram and Facebook. If regulators start coming down hard on social media companies by imposing bans, fines, or restrictions, Meta is likely to be among the hardest hit.\nWhile it might be difficult to quantify just what that could mean for its growth prospects or profitability, it's a risk investors should factor into their analysis.\nOne social media company that regulators have already come down on hard is ByteDance's TikTok. In this case, the repercussions could be significant: an outright ban on the app in the U.S. unless China-based ByteDance sells TikTok to a non-Chinese owner.\nBy April 2025, the app could be banned, effectively removing what is arguably Facebook's and Instagram's most serious competitor. But a lot needs to happen in the meantime. A deal to sell could be reached. The ban is being challenged in court and the government could lose. A potential new president in the White House could affect government actions. Policies might change as well.\nMeta stock has undoubtedly seen some upside related to the prospects of a TikTok ban. This brings to light a more concerning issue for the company: It is vulnerable to serious competition, and it might not have as secure a moat as investors could be pricing into the valuation. The company's apps might not be as solid as they looked before TikTok emerged as a viable threat.\nI'm not sold on Meta as a good growth stock because its go-to move is often to copy features from competitors. Coming out with new and innovative features just hasn't been Meta's strength over the years.\nWhen Snap attracted many users to its Snapchat platform, Meta copied some of the best features, including adding image modification effects and creating Facebook Stories. Other examples include Instagram rolling out Reels to combat TikTok, and its introduction last year of Threads, which is for text updates similar to X (formerly Twitter).\nThe one area where Meta is trying to innovate on its own is the metaverse, to the point where it even rebranded and changed its official name from Facebook in 2021. The metaverse has proved to be a costly venture and it is not producing enough revenue to cover its very high expenses. Through the first three months of the year, Meta reported losses totaling $3.8 billion on its Reality Labs segment, which includes its metaverse-related spending. That loss is only slightly less than the $4 billion loss it incurred in the prior-year period. With revenue of just $440 million from that segment of its business, it is nowhere near getting to break even anytime soon.\nIf not for the massive $17.7 billion operating profit from its core Family of Apps segment this past quarter (which includes Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Messenger), investors would likely be much less forgiving about Reality Labs' losses.\nMeta has been good at copying features but not so much in actually developing and growing its own business. And that's a concern, especially as it piles more money into the metaverse.\nMeta Platforms stock has been doing well since 2023, but this is not as good a growth stock as it might seem. The company benefits from the prospects of a TikTok ban and from copying features from rivals.\nWith plenty of potential headwinds in the future and a questionable growth strategy, this is not the type of growth stock I would be putting my investment dollars in. There are many better stocks to buy for the long haul.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  David Nadelle ",
        "Text": "For much of 2023, you couldn\u2019t even glace sideways at a media source without mention of the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks. While some of the shine has come off the group as a whole during the first half of 2024, they are still among the best stocks to watch on the stock market today due to their oversized market capitalizations.\nFind Out: In 5 Years, These 2 Stocks Will Be More Valuable Than Apple\nLearn: 4 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks \u2014 Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 still dominate today\u2019s financial news after driving the S&P 500\u00a0in 2023. They account for about half of the weighting of the Nasdaq index, which is loaded with market-cap, tech-heavy companies.\nYou could easily buy stock in all Magnificent Seven stocks in one fell swoop by investing in funds like the Vanguard Growth EFT or Mega Cap Growth EFT, which include high percentages of the U.S. megacap stocks. However, if you\u2019re looking to cash in by owning stock in one of the seven, and are trying to decide between investing in like Alphabet Inc. (Google\u2019s parent company) or Meta Platforms Inc. (the owner of Facebook and Instagram), here are some things that may sway your decision.\nWealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.\nAs The Motley Fool notes, tech behemoths Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are fairly similar: both businesses rule their respective industries by making excellent products, both initiated dividends for the first time this year and both make a killing generating enormous amounts of revenue money through digital advertising.\nWhen dissecting two companies of this size, it\u2019s really easy to sit on the fence. If you believe in the potential of the metaverse and are willing to take on higher risk for potentially higher rewards, Meta might be the better choice. If you prefer a more diversified company with steady revenue from various sources, Alphabet could be a more stable investment.\nHowever, while both companies have vast growth potential and are poised to continue to change the world as we know it from a technological perspective, they differ in the details, and evaluating the direction in which each company may move in the future many dictate where you want to place your hard earneds.\nTrading in internet search engines, cloud infrastructure, entertainment, media, advertising, consumer electronics and mobile operating systems, Alphabet\u2019s main sources of income are YouTube and Google, the world\u2019s leaders in internet searching and online video content searching, respectively.\nIt\u2019s net worth \u2014 or market cap \u2014 is $2.175 trillion today, up nearly 40% year-over-year, per Stock Analysis. And Google stock has beaten its earnings per share (EPS) and sales estimates 100% of the time in the past year, according to TipRanks, making it a \u201cstrong buy.\u201d Of the 38 analysts giving stock ratings, only five have the company\u2019s stock as a hold (none have it as a sell).\nWriting for The Motley Fool, Randi Zuckerberg, former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister of Mark, feels her brother\u2019s company is in a better position than Alphabet to take advantage of the forthcoming AI frontier.\nProviding the world with social media apps like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, Meta Platform\u2019s core earnings drivers are in advertising, the metaverse, consumer electronics and social media. Meta isn\u2019t worth as much as Alphabet, but it\u2019s still got a very well-lined purse.\nIt\u2019s now ranked as the seventh largest company in the world, with a market cap of $1.260 trillion. According to Investors.com, on April 24,\u00a0Meta beat analyst expectations\u00a0by $0.39 in earnings per share ($4.71 to $4.32) and although its executives provided a lighter-than-expected sales forecast for the current quarter, Meta stock remains a good, but maybe not a great, buy. Morningstar thinks it should be selling at $400 per share as opposed to hovering around its current $432 price (Alphabet is ~$176 USD today).\nMs. Zuckerberg is correct about Meta\u2019s favorable position moving forward and Mark is bullish about investing in AI. Meta\u2019s audience is found primarily on Facebook, and in December, the company reported a daily user figure of 2.11 billion and a monthly active user number of 3.07 billion. \u201cFew companies, of any sort, can boast of audience numbers on this scale,\u201d said TipRanks.\nBut with users comes competition, and if more people \u2014 especially legions of young influential people \u2014 spend more time on apps like TikTok, it may come at the expense of people spending time on Facebook or Instagram. Meta will always be fighting for user time and advertising money.\nAdditionally, any hard regulatory limitations or rule changes on how user data can be utilized could turn an audience away. Google\u2019s plan to phase out cookies for 100% of Chrome users by Q3 2024 is already underway and will significantly change the ad strategies of companies that use them, including Meta\u2019s big platforms.\nMeanwhile, Alphabet\u2019s non-internet search AI subsidiaries \u2014 besides the fiasco-filled launch of Gemini \u2014 have already been met with positive reviews. Waymo, the company\u2019s autonomous vehicle has already put self-driving cars on the streets of San Francisco. Alphabet has also developed encouraging Large Language Models (LLMs) that will have far reaching applications for \u201cthousands of small and medium-sized businesses,\u201d according to Laura Martin of Needham & Company. \u201cGenerative AI requires a constant inflow of millions of data points each day to keep an LLM up to date, and GOOGL ingests more data than its competitors, thanks to Search and YouTube,\u201d Martin explained.\nIf you are a hedge bettor, both companies\u2019 AI investment and election year ad spending is going to go through roof, barring a major economic downturn, and both are sound investments. But thinking ahead, Alphabet is a stronger buy of the two. It is cheaper, has healthier consensus upsides and is getting all its sources homed in on the AI revolution better than many of its Magnificent Seven rivals, including Meta.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Places in America To Retire That Are Just as Cheap as Mexico, Portugal and Costa Rica\n10 Best Items To Buy at Five Below for Summer\n5 Moves Every Woman Should Consider Before Retirement\nThis is The Single Most Overlooked Tool for Becoming Debt-Free\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Meta vs. Alphabet Stock: Which Is a Better Investment?\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (META) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nShares of this social media company have returned +11.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has gained 4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nFor the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.66 per share, indicating a change of +44.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0% over the last 30 days.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.16 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +35.6%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.04 indicates a change of +14.3% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Meta Platforms.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nFor Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $38.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +19.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $158.97 billion and $179.82 billion estimates indicate +17.8% and +13.1% changes, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $36.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.3%. EPS of $4.71 for the same period compares with $2.64 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.48%. The EPS surprise was +9.03%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nConclusion\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Neil Patel, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has been a fantastic investment historically. Despite bouts of gut-wrenching volatility, shares of the tech titan have skyrocketed 1,150% since their initial public offering (IPO) in late 2012. This gain easily outpaces the broader S&P 500.\nExisting shareholders, as well as those who might not have ever owned this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock, might be wondering if Meta has the potential to make them a millionaire in the future. If getting to a seven-figure net worth is your goal, then continue reading to see if this company's shares deserve a place in your portfolio.\nOne sign of a great business is the presence of an economic moat, a single trait or combination of traits that protects a company's industry position, while at the same time allowing it to produce strong fundamental performance for extended periods. Meta easily falls into this category.\nThe business operates some of the most successful social media apps on the planet, in Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. In total, these services had a combined 3.24 billion daily active users as of March 31. That's a truly gargantuan sum, representing 40% of the world's population. But the figure was still up 7% year over year.\nThese apps also benefit from powerful network effects. With more users, the service becomes more valuable to everyone. Anyone with technical know-how and some funding could probably launch a new social media site in no time. But to achieve the broad adoption that Meta has would be a near-impossible task. \nThis situation has created a financial juggernaut. Meta registered $135 billion in revenue in 2023, mainly from digital advertising, a 16% jump from the year before. The company produced $47 billion of operating income last year, good for a stellar 35% margin.\nThere's no reason to worry about Meta losing its standing anytime soon. Management touts strong engagement trends, an encouraging sign given the rise of TikTok.\nAnd Meta is focused on its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. The business is investing aggressively in building out servers and data centers that provide the infrastructure that can improve the experience for both users of its apps and the advertisers that depend on Meta to target large audiences. This should keep the company in a favorable position for a long time.\nIf someone were lucky and smart enough to have invested $81,000 at Meta's (then called Facebook) IPO price of over $38, their holding would be worth an astonishing $1 million today. This translates to a more than 12-fold gain.\nToday, the company carries a massive market cap of $1.2 trillion. This makes it the world's seventh-most valuable business. That scale means Meta's forward returns will undoubtedly lag what was achieved in the past. As a company gets larger, it becomes more and more difficult to drive meaningful growth that moves the needle.\nHowever, I still think Meta looks like a smart investment candidate. Despite its size, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.9. That's a reasonable valuation to pay for a business as competitively advantaged as this one.\nAccording to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Meta is expected to grow its revenue and earnings per share at compound annual rates of 14.1% and 20.5%, respectively, between 2023 and 2026. Take these forecasts with a grain of salt, but you get an idea of the company's potential.\nInvestors who are willing and able to put more money to work buying Meta's stock, while also having a longer time horizon, are in a good position to become millionaires from this social media and digital advertising powerhouse.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms Inc (META): Best Tech Stock to Buy According to Brad Gerstner?",
        "Author": "  Maleha Afzal ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Brad Gerstner. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other tech stocks.\nOn December 1, 2023, Brad Gerstner, the CEO of Altimeter Capital, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he explained that tech stocks are expected to outperform non-tech stocks in 2024. Over the past 10 years, tech earnings have compounded at almost 16% and non-tech earnings have compounded at 6%. 2023 was a rebound year for the tech industry after a downturn in 2022 due to rising interest rates. Big Tech companies and their operational efficiencies have poised them for strong growth. While inflation and interest rates will determine what goes down, companies that have invested in augmented intelligence will experience secular growth. Gerstner thinks that the spread between 16% and 6% will be a recurring trend in 2024.\nOn June 11, Brad Gerstner made another appearance on CNBC and\u00a0addressed the speculation surrounding the software industry. Gerstner suggested that despite headwinds, the software industry is still valuable as companies and startups are still making deals. Gerstner believes there are three main reasons for the downward trajectory of the software industry. He thinks that CEOs and CTOs are cautious when it comes to making investments in software. Executives want a clearer picture of the AI boom before making risky investments. Moreover, interest rates are higher than expectations, due to delayed rate cuts and compressing multiples. Lastly, general uncertainty about the future has been detrimental to the growth of the software industry. Gerstner pointed out that since the software industry is trading at 20% below its ten-year average, this may be the best time to allocate stakes in software companies. You can also take a look at the best Robinhood stocks under $20.\nGerstner thinks data and databases are extremely vital to AI applications. He thinks that companies using data to power AI are far ahead of companies simply automating services. Big Tech companies have data at the forefront of all their artificial intelligence applications. You can also read our piece on the stocks hedge funds are crazy about right now.\nBrad Gerstner is bullish on tech, and particularly software and AI. In Q1 2024, he initiated 6 new positions and also raised his stakes in 2 stocks, ending the quarter with a portfolio of $6.5 billion in 13F securities. With that, let's discuss his top tech stock picks.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nWe scanned Altimeter Capital's Q1 portfolio and picked growth stocks from the fund\u2019s top 13F holdings. Additionally, we\u2019ve also added overall hedge fund sentiment, as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNote: All pricing data is as of June 28.\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nAltimeter Capital's Stake Value: $1,144,706,778\u00a0\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 246\nSecond on our list and Brad Gerstner's portfolio is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). In the first quarter of 2024, the company launched Generative AI image expansion tools on Facebook and Instagram reels. The update has witnessed widespread adoption by small businesses. The company has been making significant progress on AI and Metaverse and plans to increase spending from $35 billion to $40 billion. The decision is driven by significant investments in AI, data centers, chip designs, and R&D. In April, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) introduced its next generation of custom chips to manage the company\u2019s AI workloads. The chips are designed to balance compute, memory bandwidth, and memory capacity for ranking and recommendation models. Last year, the company launched its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), its first-gen AI inference accelerator. The accelerator is focused on developing efficient architecture for the company\u2019s workloads.\nAt the close of Q1 2024, 246 investors disclosed positions in the stock with total stakes amounting to $46.92 billion, up by $44.17 billion from the previous quarter. Considering analysts expect Meta's earnings to grow by 27% this year and 46% by 2025, it is a great pick by Brad Gerstner.\nIn 2022, Gerstner sent an open letter to the CEO of META, Mark Zuckerburg, asking for cost-cutting and improving efficiencies. Exactly a year later, on October 26, 2023, Brad Gerstner appeared in an interview on CNBC, where he stated that he regained confidence in the stock after META decided to pursue efficiency throughout the year. He stated that the company has increased its free cash flow from $18 billion to $35 billion in a year, and reduced its headcount by 24% to become a more efficient company. Here are some comments from the interview:\n\"A couple months after we wrote the letter, that mark first declared it the year of efficiency, discipline, and rigor. And has he delivered imagine a year ago thinking that they could reaccelerate the top line of the business, while doubling free cash flow from $18 billion to $35 billion, and let's talk about efficiency. He and Elon Musk stand atop the heap of efficiency and reduced head count 24% year over year. From 85,000 to 65,000 employees.

        "Title": "Is Meta the Best Growth Stock to Buy According to Dan Loeb?",
        "Author": "  Omer Farooq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb and in this article we will discuss the activist investor's position in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\nBillionaire investor Dan Loeb's hedge fund Third Point had a strong start to 2024 after its offshore fund posted returns of 7.8% in the first quarter chugging along with the broader market's 10.6% gain. AI has been one of his top investing themes for some time now and the activist shareholder maintains his bullish view on the technology. In the first quarter, he initiated a position in Alphabet and also increased his position in Amazon by 22% to about $920 million.\nLoeb's also bullish on the energy transition and one of his favorite stocks that is expected to benefit from the AI-driven electricity demand is Vistra, one of the largest independent power producers and retail electricity providers in the US. Though Vistra's core markets have experienced volatility due to weak domestic electricity demand, the power company's \"capital allocation strategy has been brilliant\", he stated in his Q1 2024 letter to shareholders, seen by Insider Monkey. In the weak demand environment for fossil fuels, Vistra made smart moves by shutting down its unprofitable coal plants and instead buying back 33% of its shares between 2018 and 2023. Additionally, its acquisition of nuclear generation assets of Ohio-based energy company, Energy Harbor, was right on time as governments are turning to nuclear fuel sources to meet the world's growing energy demands. Loeb expects Vistra to be a direct beneficiary of AI-driven electricity demand and is bullish on the company's unique position of holding both renewable and fossil fuel-based assets under its belt.\nAnother AI play Loeb is increasingly bullish on is UK-based stock exchange and financial data company London Stock Exchange Group. The activist investor likes the company's unique market position as a data provider that is democratizing and making financial data accessible to consumers without the use of additional third-party software. He sees London Stock Exchange Group benefitting from generative AI as information retrieval systems in financial services become more powerful. He also expects the company to develop \"a powerful Research Assistant application\" with Microsoft to reduce both human resources and time needed to process financial data. He thinks London Stock Exchange Group is at the forefront of capitalizing on the transition of the financial services industry \"from manual data processing via clunky desktop terminals to machine-assisted data processing\".\nOur Methodology\nWe scanned Third Point\u2019s Q1 portfolio and picked growth stocks from the fund\u2019s top 13F holdings. Additionally, we've also added overall hedge fund sentiment, as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNote: All pricing data is as of June 6.\nGiuseppe Costantino / Shutterstock.com\nThird Point's Stake Value: $600,176,880\u00a0\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 246\nLoeb upped his stakes in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) by 7% in Q1 2024, ending the quarter with a position of over $600 million. In total, 246 hedge funds were bullish on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and ended the quarter with positions worth $47 billion. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of Dan Loeb's top growth stock picks.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is seeing robust ad revenue growth. Its Family of Apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) generated ad revenue of $35.6 billion, up 27% year over year, and about 3.2 billion people use one of its apps each day. However, the company's AR/VR business Reality Labs keeps bleeding cash and logged losses of $3.85 billion in Q1. Management said its AR/VR business is supporting its AI initiatives and it continues to be optimistic about the future of the metaverse and mixed-reality ecosystem. The company is sticking to its strategy of collaborating with eyewear brands such as EssilorLuxottica to build virtual and mixed reality headsets to boost its market share. Meta is also making progress on the AI front and successfully rolled out its AI assistant Meta AI and is currently in the process of training Meta Llama 3, a 400-billion+ parameter large language model. What's interesting about Meta's two long-term focus areas is the fusion of AI and mixed reality. While still in its infancy, the metaverse concept shows more promise with the addition of AI to it. Meta is integrating AI functionalities into its smart glasses which will give users access to real-time information related to their surroundings.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) also raised its capital expenditures guidance for 2024, saying it expects CapEx to range between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from its prior guidance of $30 billion to $37 billion. The group is investing heavily in infrastructure and AI, and is reportedly working on its own in-house AI chips. By developing its own AI chips, Meta can gain a competitive advantage in the market, reducing its reliance on external providers and improving the performance of its AI applications.\nWhy should growth investors consider Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)? The company has grown at double digits consistently over the past 10 years, growing its revenue by a CAGR of 32% and net income by 37.3%. The company has also started paying dividends and exited Q1 2024 with $16 billion in capital returns through dividends and buybacks. In a world where cash is king, Meta doesn't lose. The company has grown its free cash flow by a compound annual growth rate of 23% over the past 10 years. In 2023, Meta's net income was $39 billion and it ended the year with a free cash flow of $44 billion, its FCF to net income ratio is 113%. Meta is an extremely profitable company that is pioneering disruptive technologies and with its strong near-monopoly position in social media and digital advertising, we think it's a good idea while it trades at 24.5 times its forward earnings, close to its 5-year average multiple of 23.7x.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on our list. To discover Dan Loeb's top growth stock picks, check out our free report on\u00a0 of the 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb.

        "Title": "A Look At The Fair Value Of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms' estimated fair value is US$561 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\nWith US$504 share price, Meta Platforms appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\nOur fair value estimate is 7.7% higher than Meta Platforms' analyst price target of US$521\nHow far off is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n Levered FCF ($, Millions) \nUS$45.7b\nUS$52.2b\nUS$58.9b\nUS$66.7b\nUS$72.5b\nUS$76.9b\nUS$80.8b\nUS$84.2b\nUS$87.3b\nUS$90.1b\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\nAnalyst x19\nAnalyst x19\nAnalyst x9\nAnalyst x4\nAnalyst x3\nEst @ 6.11%\nEst @ 4.99%\nEst @ 4.21%\nEst @ 3.66%\nEst @ 3.27%\n Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% \nUS$42.7k\nUS$45.4k\nUS$47.8k\nUS$50.4k\nUS$51.2k\nUS$50.6k\nUS$49.6k\nUS$48.2k\nUS$46.6k\nUS$44.8k\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$477b\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$90b\u00d7 (1 + 2.4%) \u00f7 (7.2%\u2013 2.4%) = US$1.9t\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.9t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$946b\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$1.4t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$504, the company appears about fair value at a 10% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Meta Platforms as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.055. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\nStrength\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\nWeakness\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\nOpportunity\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\nThreat\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "Title": "AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential",
        "Author": "  Sheraden Frances ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has experienced a significant surge so far this year, pushing the stock to nearly a 40% premium over its previous peak set in 2021, primarily due to its comeback in the social media advertising space after Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Tracking Transparency update, which had severely impacted its targeting capabilities.\nFigure 1: Meta Platforms' shares up 44% year to date\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nDespite this recovery, the first-quarter earnings season has generally been disappointing, and investors have found few reasons to chase market highs, resulting in Meta's stock plummeting by over 13% post-earnings report. The social media giant's decision to increase its capital expenditure outlook for the year without a corresponding uptick in growth led to investor skepticism about the efficiency of its spending. Meta's operational expenses are now projected to be between $96 billion and $99 billion, a $2 billion increase at the low end of the previous range of $94 billion to $99 billion. This new range represents a 9% year-over-year increase in operating expenses compared to $88.20 billion in 2023.\nRegardless of these challenges, I believe Meta's updated fundamentals and its position as a leader in adopting artificial intelligence transformation support a positive long-term growth and margin expansion trajectory. This outlook underpins its valuation prospects and maintains a robust outlook for the company, even with the unexpected capital expenditure increase. Although Meta's earnings dropped by double digits, the stock is still up more than 40% year to date. This recent dip presents a substantial opportunity for investors to buy into the Meta rally if they have not already.\nMuch of Meta's $70 billion capital expenditure over the past two years, in addition to its research and development efforts, has been directed toward the development and deployment of AI technologies. These investments have paid off significantly. The recovery Meta experienced following Apple's ATT update in 2022 can be largely attributed to its AI initiatives, which helped restore its targeting capabilities and sustain its advertising business. As one of the tech giants with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion, Meta continues to grow its revenue at an impressive rate of over 20% annually. As a growth stock, it is logical for Meta to continue channeling resources into further growth initiatives.\nRecent industry data highlights the impact of Meta's AI investments. More than half of the content viewed by Instagram users is now recommended by AI algorithms. A survey revealed that 53% of Facebook and Instagram users spent more time on these apps compared to last year, whereas TikTok reported a 25% increase in user engagement over the same period. This underscores the effectiveness of Meta's AI in enhancing user engagement. Additionally, the company has consistently improved return on ad spend (ROAS) for advertisers through AI-enabled tools. The number of ad impressions served increased by 20% year over year and the average price per ad rose by 6%, reversing previous downward trends.\nFigure 2: Ad impressions growth year over year\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\nFigure 3: Average price per ad growth year over year\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\nLooking forward, Meta's ongoing commitment to AI developments is expected to bolster its strategy for monetizing its extensive user and merchant base. The company is also advancing its next-generation Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), following in the footsteps of other tech giants who are enhancing their in-house silicon capabilities to reduce dependency on third-party hardware essential for AI advancements. This development complements Meta's AI investment cycle, which includes acquiring up to 350,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 GPUs. Continued vertical integration and diversified hardware reliance are anticipated to support the long-term success of its AI strategy and drive margin expansion at scale.\nMeta continues to see an increase in daily active users across its platforms, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger and Instagram. With 3.24 billion daily users, the social media giant boasts one of the strongest network effects in the industry. The company has not only rebounded in user activity, but has also achieved robust growth. From first-quarter 2022 to first-quarter 2023, Meta's monthly active users grew by 15 million. From the first quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024, this number increased by 22 million, marking almost a 50% rise in growth. This is particularly impressive considering the company already engages 40% of the global population as monthly active users, underscoring how integral its platforms are to daily life.\nFigure 4: Meta daily active people\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\nNo competitor has been able to challenge Meta's dominance effectively. While companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) could develop their own social networks, the established user base of Facebook and Instagram creates a substantial barrier to entry. Google might integrate AI features into Bing and Apple might impose privacy settings to hinder Meta, but its investment in AI has allowed it to overcome these obstacles and continue to deliver personalized advertising. Even TikTok, Meta's closest competitor, faces significant operational challenges in the West with potential bans looming.\nMeta also has significant potential for diversification beyond its traditional revenue streams, particularly in the augmented reality and virtual reality markets. These efforts are encapsulated in the Reality Labs segment, which, despite being loss-making, represents a long-term investment.\nIn the most recent quarter, Reality Labs reported $3.8 billion in losses, a slight improvement year over year. Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged the business will not be profitable until 2030, so immediate substantial cash flows are not expected. The Metaverse project, still in its early stages, requires years for consumer habits to adapt. Despite its current unprofitability, Meta holds a significant share of the AR and VR market. Few other companies are willing or able to invest as heavily in this space. Even Apple's entry with the Vision Pro has not made the expected impact, leaving Meta as a dominant player in the long-term development of these technologies.\nMeta has consistently demonstrated robust revenue growth, except in 2022 when its advertising business faced challenges due to Apple's ATT. The resurgence of Chinese e-commerce companies like Temu and Shein, which have heavily invested in Meta's ad solutions, has significantly boosted ad revenue over the past several quarters. The company's free cash flow margin currently stands at 35%, with the potential to exceed 40% if the capital expenditure is reduced in the coming years.\nFigure 5: Meta's financials recovery following slump in 2022 \nSource: Meta Investor Relations\nMeta's core social media business continues to perform well, particularly outside its primary markets, with revenue reaching $36.50 billion, up nearly 20% year over year. Notably, there was an almost 50% increase in revenue from the \"Rest of World\" segment. For 2024, I anticipate 16% year-over-year revenue growth to $156.60 billion, driven by sustained demand for advertising across the Family of Apps and the expansion of business messaging opportunities. Advertising will remain central to Meta's business as online ad demand grows and Facebook maintains its significant market share.\nFigure 6: Meta ad revenue by geography\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\nDespite increased spending, Meta has significantly improved its operating margins. In the first quarter, the company reported $13.80 billion in operating profit, nearly doubling year over year, with operating margin rising from 25% in the prior year to 38% in the most recent quarter. However, the overall operating margin fell quarter over quarter, impacted by widening losses in the Reality Labs segment and a decline in the Family of Apps segment's operating margin, which constitutes 98.90% of total revenue. The decrease in operating margin is attributed to substantial investments in AI infrastructure.\nFor 2024, I expect profit margins to remain relatively flat compared to 2023, as margin expansion driven by strong ad demand will likely be offset by increased losses in Reality Labs and additional short-term investments in the AI roadmap.\nFigure 7: Meta's operating margin \nMETA Data by GuruFocus\nMeta's cash flow remains robust despite continued losses from Reality Labs. The company's annualized free cash flow has surpassed $50 billion, an impressive figure for a company with a market capitalization of nearly $1.20 trillion, equating to an almost 5% FCF yield. This is despite significant capital investments, which amounted to nearly $30 billion in 2023. Meta now projects capital expenditures of $35 billion to $40 billion, up from an earlier estimate of $30 billion to $37 billion. This is considerably higher than the average capex over the previous two years.\nIn the long term, I anticipate a reduction in these capital expenditures as the majority of these investments are one-time expenses aimed at building out AI infrastructure. Consequently, Meta's ability to generate cash flows is expected to strengthen significantly once these investments are completed.\nFigure 8: Meta's capex\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\nMeta's financial performance underscores its resilience and growth potential, driven by strategic investments in AI and robust revenue growth from its core social media platforms. While current expenditures are high, they are largely one-off investments that will position Meta for stronger cash flow generation and sustained profitability in the long term. Despite some short-term margin pressures, the company's long-term outlook remains positive, making it a compelling investment opportunity.\nI remain confident that Meta is well-positioned for an upside scenario, supported by its leadership in social media advertising and the 6% increase in average price per ad during the first quarter, despite the seasonal slowdown. Additionally, given its significant advancements with large language models, I believe Meta has a promising future in the AI market. The market seems to agree with this outlook, even after the post-earnings drop. Although current metrics suggest the market already values the stock at a premium for its robust business model, I believe the shares are still undervalued. Trading at about 8 times estimated sales and 24 times estimated earnings, Meta's valuation is lower than its mega-cap rivals by wide margins, yet remains consistent with its peers relative to their growth profiles.\nFigure 9: DCF Calculation\nConsidering upside scenario cash flows while maintaining base case valuation assumptionsan 11.10% weighted average cost of capital and an expected earnings per share growth rate of 18.41% (achievable given that the expected 10-year earing per share without NRI growth rate is less than the historical 10-year earnings growth rate of 35.70%)I calculate Meta's margin of safety or upside potential at around 9%, with an intrinsic value of approximately $548.44 per share. This would take the stock to new record levels, which seems likely by year-end considering the upcoming cyclical tailwinds. Additionally, this model does not account for Meta's significant share buyback program. The company is spending tens of billions on share repurchases, which will positively impact the fair value per share. The company has a $50 billion authorized buyback program, enough to cover almost 5% of outstanding shares, potentially completing it in just one and a half years.\nMeta Platforms is well-positioned for substantial growth, supported by its leadership in social media advertising and strategic investments in AI. Despite some short-term challenges and increased expenditures, the company's long-term outlook remains positive. With robust revenue growth, strong cash flow generation and a significant share buyback program, Meta presents a compelling investment opportunity. The potential upside, driven by AI advancements and cyclical tailwinds, reinforces the company's promising future.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Is Meta Platforms, Inc. The Best Quality Stock to Buy Now?",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled the list of the 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy according to the hedge funds using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other quality stocks.\nInvesting in 2024 is significantly different from investing in the 1950s and onward. This is because these days investors have to. sift through thousands of stocks and countless data points and signals to separate the wheat from the chaff and make the right investment decisions. Amidst this hubris, the ability to pick out 'quality' stocks becomes important, and there's quite a lot of financial literature available that helps determine what such stocks are.\nTypically, stock analysis involves analyzing a firm's financial statements to determine profitability, operating strengths, cost control, asset utilization, and other metrics. Some of these are also present in financial literature that discusses quality stocks. One such research paper comes courtesy of researchers associated with Research Affiliates. They point out that metrics that typically define a quality stock include earnings stability, capital structure, profitability, accounting practices, and investing strategies. Within these, the quality factors that were also related to returns were investment strategies, dividend payouts, profitability, and accounting strategies.\nThe next thing to ask is, whether quality stocks are any different from standard run of the mill stocks when it comes to share price performance. For context, the last 12 months on the stock market have been dominated by a few key themes. These are artificial intelligence, inflation, interest rates, and GDP growth. Higher rates and inflation are bearish stock indicators, while growth and AI have proven to have kept the market buoyant at a time when rates are at two decade high levels. So, over the past year, exchange traded funds that track quality stocks have appreciated by 12% to 27%, the midpoint of which is slightly lower than the S&P 500's 23% price appreciation over the same time period. However, picking the right quality stocks appears to have its advantages as well, since the high end of the performance, i.e. 27%, is far higher than what the index has delivered.\nETFs and research aren't the only ones that talk about quality stocks. One hedge fund that's become quite well known for its focus on quality stocks is Cliff Asness\u2019 AQR Capital Management. One of the largest hedge funds in the world, AQR had a 13F investment portfolio worth $58 billion as of Q1 2024 end according to Insider Monkey's research. Close to a quarter of its portfolio is invested in the technology industry, and the second biggest category is services stocks. AQR focuses on stocks that follow its strategy of Quality Minus Junk or QMJ. According to its founder Cliff Asness, a quality stock is defined by its shareholder payouts, growth, profitability, and sound financial and general management. We recently took a look at some top AQR Capital management stocks and you can check them out by looking at 13 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness.\nBefore we head to our list of the best quality stocks, a general overview of the stock market is relevant. Right now, investors are wondering when the first interest rate cuts might occur. The latest bit on this front came in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data from the Commerce Department. This data set revealed that the 12 month inflation in the US stood at 2.7% in April 2024, which was still higher than the Fed's preferred rate of 2%. Additionally, the data also provided investors with some bearish signals. These were apparent in the readings for consumer spending, which slowed down to 2% in the first quarter of 2024 over the robust 3.3% reading in Q4 2023.\nLower spending means less money sloshing in the economy, and while this might help reduce prices, it can also affect business performance, economic growth, and naturally, stock market performance. Data from the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that 47% of all investors polled expect a 25 basis point rate cut in September, while an additional 7.5% believe that the Fed might get generous and cut rates by as much as 50 basis points.\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top quality stocks that hedge funds are buying.\nMethodology\nTo make our list of the best quality stocks to buy, we ranked the 30 largest constituents of a quality stock ETF and picked out those with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q1 2024. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 246\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. It's another highly rated big tech AI stock. The average of 52 one year Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) share price target is $512.99 and the average rating is Strong Buy. The firm has also beaten analyst EPS estimates in all four of its latest quarters. A Strong Buy doesn't scratch the itch? Well, consider a rather rare Sell rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s shares by BNP Paribas in May 2024. The firm took aim at Meta's AI spending, sharing that while other big tech AI players like Alphabet have the revenue to fund it, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) might find it difficult to do so. AI spending has been a key concern for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) investors, and they have often punished the shares because of it.\nAs of Q1 2024 end, 246 out of the 933 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey's research were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s stakeholders. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners held the most valuable stake which was worth $5.5 billion.\nLike Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s price to forward earnings ratio is 23.63 which is nearly in line with the S&P 500's 21. Additionally, while the revenue has grown by 57% over the past four years, the shares have appreciated by 123%, creating similar worries to Google's stock. However, Meta could benefit significantly from making its AI model Llama open source and capturing market share. While BNP Paribas is wary of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Harding Loevner took a different tone in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\nMeta\u2019s AI-powered Advantage+ product is winning an increasing share of advertisers\u2019 budgets, supporting the company\u2019s continued dominance of the digital-advertising market. Meta\u2019s content-recommendation engine also has improved engagement and monetization for the Reels video feature, as competition from TikTok abates. Netflix reported better-than-expected subscriber growth for the fourth quarter of 2023 and improving profitability, trends that management said would continue in 2024.\nOverall, META ranks 2nd among the 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy now. You can visit 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy to see the other quality stocks that are on the hedge fund radar. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an AI play, our conviction lies in the belief that there are other AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Author": "  Scott Levine, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The face of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, founded the social networking company 20 years ago. Now organized under the parent company Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Facebook remains one of the most influential social media sites on the internet under the leadership of Zuckerberg, the company's largest shareholder.\nBut that's not to say that there aren't other individuals and institutions with sizable positions in Meta. Let's dig under the surface a little and see who the other major investors in Meta stock are.\nIn terms of insiders, the next-largest Meta shareholder after Mark Zuckerberg is Sheryl Sandberg. In addition to serving as the company's chief operating officer for 14 years, Sandberg was a member of the company's board of directors, a position which she left in May 2024. According to a May 31, 2024 regulatory filing, Sandberg owns 639,610 shares of Meta stock, representing about 0.03% of the 2,191,446,233 outstanding shares of the company's Class A stock.\nWith regards to institutional owners, Vanguard holds the top spot among the social media company's investors, owning 186,347,527 shares of Meta stock. Representing about 8.4% of Meta Class A stock, Vanguard's ownership stake is impressive. But it's worth noting that BlackRock also has a hefty position, owning 7.1% of Meta stock in its iShares series of exchange-traded funds.\nAfter seeing the sizable positions that some hold in Meta, retail investors may be wondering if they should pick up shares for themselves. In light of the commanding position that Meta has in social networking, it's a more-than-reasonable consideration. What's especially worth recognizing is the company's commitment to incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into the various platforms that the company owns, making it a worthy option for investors looking for AI exposure that transcends semiconductor companies.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), we liked what we saw.\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Meta Platforms:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.29 = US$56b \u00f7 (US$223b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\nThus, Meta Platforms has an ROCE of 29%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 6.4% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Meta Platforms compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Meta Platforms .\nWe'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Meta Platforms. The company has employed 96% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 29%. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.\nIn short, we'd argue Meta Platforms has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 167% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\nLike most companies, Meta Platforms does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Foo Yun Chee ",
        "Text": "By Foo Yun Chee\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Meta Platforms will not launch its Meta AI models in Europe for now after the Irish privacy regulator told it to delay its plan to harness data from Facebook and Instagram users, the U.S. social media company said on Friday.\nThe move by Meta came after complaints and a call by advocacy group NOYB to data protection authorities in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Spain to act against the company.\nAt issue is Meta's plan to use personal data to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models without seeking consent, although the company has said it would use publicly available and licensed online information.\nMeta on Friday said the Irish privacy watchdog had asked it to delay training its large language models (LLMs) using public content shared by Facebook and Instagram adult users.\n\"We're disappointed by the request from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), our lead regulator, on behalf of the European DPAs ... particularly since we incorporated regulatory feedback and the European DPAs have been informed since March,\" the company said in an updated blogpost.\nIt said the Irish request is a step backwards for European innovation and competition in AI development.\n\"Put simply, without including local information we'd only be able to offer people a second-rate experience. This means we aren't able to launch Meta AI in Europe at the moment,\" Meta said.\nThe DPC welcomed Meta's pause, saying its decision came after intensive engagement with the regulator.\nMeta said the delayed launch of its AI models would also allow it to address requests from Britain's Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO).\nThe ICO welcomed Meta's decision, saying it would continue to monitor major developers of generative AI, including Meta, to review the safeguards they have put in place and ensure the information rights of UK users are protected.\nNOYB's chair Max Schrems attributed Meta's temporary halt to the group's complaints filed last week.\n\"So far there is no official change of the Meta privacy policy, which would make this commitment legally binding. The cases we filed are ongoing and will need a determination,\" he said in a statement.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Additional reporting by Padraic Halpin in Dublin and Muvija M in London; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta, Andrea Ricci and Jan Harvey)\n"

        "Title": "Meta axed his AI biology research team. Now this \u2018Meta AI Mafia\u2019 member\u2019s new startup has $142 million to chase his protein-generating dream",
        "Author": "  Sharon Goldman ",
        "Text": "In August 2023, Meta disbanded a research team of a dozen scientists that had trained an AI large language model for biology\u2014as part of Mark Zuckerberg's \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d that led to over 20,000 layoffs.\nBut Alexander Rives, who led the research cohort known as Meta\u2019s \u201cAI protein team,\u201d was not deterred by Meta\u2019s move. He immediately spun up a startup with a core group of his former Meta colleagues, called EvolutionaryScale, to continue their work building large language models that, instead of generating text, images or video, generate recipes for entirely new proteins.\nThis idea is to essentially make biology programmable, with potential applications ranging from drug development and cancer treatment (such as antibodies) to environmental protection techniques (for example, enzymes\u2014which are proteins\u2014can help degrade plastic). Researchers would be able to specify the function of the protein and other attributes, such as its toxicity to humans, as a prompt and have the AI model return the DNA formula for manufacturing exactly that protein.\nToday, the New York and San Francisco-based EvolutionaryScale announced it has raised over $142 million in seed funding, led by Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, and Lux Capital, with participation from Amazon Web Services (AWS), NVentures (NVIDIA\u2019s venture capital arm) and angel investors. The announcement adds Rives and his ex-Meta team to a growing list of Meta alumni\u2014a \u201cMeta AI Mafia\u201d of sorts\u2014that have made waves with new startups in the space, most notably Mistral.\nIn addition to the funding, the company also announced that it had created ESM3, which Rives told Fortune is a generative model for biology that has been trained on more computation than any other LLM in that space. The model, having been trained on nearly 4 billion proteins from the natural world, can simultaneously reason over the DNA sequence, physical structure, and function of proteins\u2014three fundamental aspects of proteins\u2019 biology and biochemistry. And in a new paper, EvolutionaryScale showed how it applied ESM3 to generate an entirely new fluorescent protein\u2014a type of protein first isolated in glowing jellyfish\u2014that, in nature, would take millions of years of evolution to create.\nThe AI model, he explained, can process the three-dimensional structure of proteins as a language\u2014as an alphabet of different characters\u2014that can then be prompted like other models including ChatGPT. But in this case, the \u201cgrammar\u201d of proteins allows the model to be prompted with any combination of the sequence, structure and function of a protein. \u201cWe see that the model is able to find very creative solutions to these prompts,\u201d he said.\nTo train such a large-scale model requires expertise in both biology and machine learning and massive amounts of computing power\u2014which explains the jaw-dropping early fund raise. \u201cThey require a great deal of compute to build and train, similar to other frontier modeling efforts across AI,\" Rives said. The fund raise, he said, \u201creally reflects the resources that we need to do that.\u201d\nEvolutionaryScale is far from the only company honing on the potential for generative AI-powered biology or even pursuing LLMs specifically. InstaDeep, a London-based company that was acquired in 2023 by BioNTech, best known for helping to create the Pfizer Covid vaccine, has created an LLM for genomics, although it is not as large as the one EvolutionaryScale is working on. Profluent, a San Francisco-based AI-enabled biotech startup, is also focused on developing LLMs to design new proteins. And Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold is a model that predicts the structure of proteins using a generative AI model.\nNat Friedman, who led the funding round in EvolutionaryScale with his investing partner Daniel Gross said Rives and the other Meta alumni are a \u201cdream team.\u201d (Gross recently teamed up with ex-OpenAI\u2019s Ilya Sutskever and Daniel Levy to launch a new startup, Safe Superintelligence.)\n\u201cThis was clearly the team that had invented protein language modeling and had all the capacity to continue to scale this up,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cAlex thinks very big. He wants to build a full multimodal model that captures all the complexity of biology. I had been looking for someone who had that ambition and vision and scale of thinking and the expertise to pull it off.\u201d\nRives said ESM3 will have an immediate impact on scientific research, with academics able to use open versions of the model for free. The company will also offer a commercial version for pharmaceutical companies to use in drug discovery and development. This is similar to the model Google DeepMind has pursued, with version of AlphaFold available to researchers for free, but with a separate spin-out company, Isomorphic Labs, working on partnerships with pharmaceutical companies.\nAs for Meta, Rives said he was not terribly surprised when the company disbanded his team.\n\u201cMeta is not a biotechnology company,\u201d he said. While Meta\u2019s open research culture made it an \u201cincredible\u201d place to do the work, he added, \u201cwe were reaching the point where we really wanted to go to the next level of scaling these models. I think building a new company was really the right place to do that.\u201d\nIt\u2019s an \u201cunbelievably talented alumni group that\u2019s come out of\u201d Meta, Freidman said. \u201cThey hired some incredible people\u2014and I think the EvolutionaryScale team is very grateful to Meta for incubating their efforts.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Meta (META) is looking to revitalize its Facebook app for users other than your weird Uncle Greg with a fresh push to grab Gen Z\u2019s attention. Facebook head Tom Alison is pitching the social network as a place for young adult users between the ages of 18 and 29 to connect, shop, and keep up with the latest trends.\n\"In order to stay relevant, we have to build for the next generation of social media consumers ... Gen Z,\" Alison said during a creator-centric event in New York City on Friday. \"Our product roadmap is driven by the needs of young adults.\"\nThe 20-year-old social network that turned Meta into a tech powerhouse isn't as popular among teens as its sister app, Instagram. According to Piper Sandler\u2019s latest Taking Stock with Teens survey, just 32% of teens use Facebook each month compared to 80% who use Instagram and 72% who access TikTok.\nBut according to Alison, Facebook is a match for users in their late teens and 20s who are navigating various life changes.\n\u201cAs we were doing a lot of research we saw, for example, when somebody's moving to their first apartment, they're already going to [Facebook] Marketplace. And then they're \u2026 often joining a group in their new college to meet new people,\u201d Alison said.\n\u201cAnd we realized, well, a lot of this kind of stuff is already happening on Facebook. We just need to do a really good job bringing it together.\u201d\nPart of that process has included enticing creators to join the platform by improving both its video efforts via its short-form video platform, Reels, and its search function.\nThe strategy seems to be working so far. According to Alison, Facebook has been growing in the US for several quarters and year over year with young adults. What\u2019s more, people spend 60% of their time on Facebook watching videos.\nFacebook took a rare hit after user numbers declined in Q2 2022 from 2.936 billion monthly active users to 2.934 billion, eliciting predictions that the platform was on a downward trajectory. Since then, however, the social network has grown each quarter from Q3 2022 through Q4 2023. The company didn't report monthly active Facebook users in its latest quarterly report.\nAlison says his team was initially concerned that the updates to the platform could alienate the older users the social network has become associated with.\nThe group, however, has largely taken to the feature improvements, as have the millennials who first joined the social network when it launched in 2014.\n\u201cI do think Facebook has had a unique staying power because we've always been willing to change,\u201d Alison said.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other hedge fund-approved stocks.\nInvesting, broadly speaking, narrows down to two strategies. These see an investor decide whether to buy a stock for the short term and make quick profits or hold it for years to patiently wait for the returns to accrue. One of the most successful investor of our times, Warren Buffett (see his latest portfolio), is an ardent follower of the latter approach, and his wealth bears testament to his success.\nOf course, deciding to pick the right stocks to sit on for years isn't easy or else everyone would be rich by now. However, there are ways in which one can gain an edge over others. One such way is to see what the professionals are doing and then emulate their strategy. At Insider Monkey, we get right at the heart of investing by picking out the top stocks that hedge funds are investing in. Why hedge fund stock picks? Well, these professionals, who almost often charge an arm and a leg for their services, conduct extensive due diligence to pick out the right set of stocks. After all, no one would invest with a hedge fund if the fund was simply picking stocks by flipping a coin.\nYet, while due diligence is great and necessary to protect investors, investing, at the end of the day, is all about returns. By the looks of it, the funds do seem to know what they're doing. Last year, the top ten hedge fund stock picks ended up outperforming the S&P benchmark stock index by 48.9 percentage points. In other words, while the index returned 26.1% in 2023, the top ten stocks returned 75.1% through price gains. This trend is also present in the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2023 as these posted 53.2% in gains to outperform the S&P by 27 percentage points. Unsurprisingly, year to May 29th, the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2024 led the S&P's 11% and posted 20.2% in gains.\nUnfortunately, though, data shows that as of 2021 end, 14% of the stock market was made of active funds while 16% was accounted for by passive funds. Compared to passive funds accounting for 8% of the market a decade ago with 20% belonging to active funds, it's clear that the broader public believes that shifting to passive is a safer investment approach. After all, while everyone wants to make money, no one wants to lose it either.\nBut what if one could make their own investing decisions and gain an inside track to investing by figuring out what stocks most hedge funds have invested in? Well, at Insider Monkey we regularly compile data from more than 900 hedge funds to see where the smart money is headed. This is how we know that the top hedge fund stocks outperformed the benchmark index last year, and it's also a strategy that's helped us beat the market over the last 10 years. Compared to the SPY's 235.6% in returns between 2014 and May 2024, the 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 463.7%.\nBut wait. At this point, you could argue that since hedge fund SEC filings come with a 45 day lag, perhaps they aren't that important. After all, it might be more important to know what the funds are doing now. Well, since we've been compiling top hedge fund stocks since 2012 in our quarterly newsletter, we can guarantee you that the top hedge fund stocks haven't changed by much since 2018. So not only isn't the time lag that significant, but by subscribing to our newsletter, you can gain an early track to see which stocks are falling out of favor among the funds as well.\nSo, all this talk about the top hedge fund stocks might make you wonder about the stocks themselves. Curious? Check out the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. We also cover legendary investors through pieces such as Warren Buffett\u2019s 12 Longest Held Stocks.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the top ten hedge fund stocks, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900+ hedge fund filings for Q1 2024 and picked out the stocks with the highest number of investors.\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 246\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the largest social media and communications firms in the world. Its primary social media platform Facebook provides it with a stable revenue base due to a sizeable amount of users that are targetted through advertisements. At the same time, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has made key moves in the AI industry through its Llama model and impressed developers by making Llama open source. To maintain its dominance, the firm has to regularly ensure that users remain engaged on Facebook and Instagram and do not migrate to other social media networks such as Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter). Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s decision to buy hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs for AI training have also placed it in a key position in the AI industry since the GPUs are in short supply and those with access can gain advantages in developing new models. Should the firm succeed in commercializing Llama, then the future could be very bright for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\nBaron Funds is of the view that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) can maintain its key role in the industry due to its sizeable user base and key ties with advertisers. In its Q1 2024 investor letter, the fund outlined:\nShares of Meta Platforms, Inc., the world\u2019s largest social network, rose 37.3% in the quarter due to robust fourth quarter top-line growth of 25% year-over-year with operating margins more than doubling year-over-year to 41%, benefiting from the year of efficiency12 as Meta\u2019s headcount was down 22% year-over-year (note that the profitability of the core business is even stronger as Reality Labs\u2019 losses of over $4.5 billion in the quarter are included in the overall operating income metric). Meta also guided for first- quarter revenue growth of approximately 29% year-over-year, which was better than expected. Advertiser satisfaction and adoption of Meta remains strong, core app engagement is healthy with video daily watch time up 25% year-over-year and the total number of monthly active users up 6% year-on-year to 3.98 billion in the fourth quarter, and Instagram Reels and click-to-message ads monetization continues to improve. Meta also continues to rapidly innovate in GenAI, with its leading research lab releasing widely adopted open-source models (e.g., Llama 2), and internal algorithms and core apps becoming augmented with AI (e.g., Meta\u2019s recommendation engine). We remain shareholders and believe Meta can sustain its leading market share in digital advertising thanks to strong network effects enabled by its massive user and advertiser base. Additionally, we believe the company\u2019s innovative culture, large installed base, and leading GenAI research should enable it to embed AI and GenAI into its offerings with further monetization opportunities ahead. For example, AI agents could help scale business messaging, handling a large volume of customer requests on behalf of business customers, making business messaging at scale more viable.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best hedge fund-approved stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now to see the other hedge fund-approved stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "These 4 Measures Indicate That Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Is Using Debt Safely",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of March 2024 Meta Platforms had US$18.4b of debt, an increase on US$9.93b, over one year. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$58.1b in cash, so it actually has US$39.7b net cash.\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Meta Platforms had liabilities of US$28.1b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$45.2b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$58.1b as well as receivables valued at US$13.4b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$1.77b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\nThis state of affairs indicates that Meta Platforms' balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$1.25t company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Meta Platforms also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.\nOn top of that, Meta Platforms grew its EBIT by 72% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Meta Platforms's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. While Meta Platforms has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. During the last three years, Meta Platforms generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 80% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\nWhile it is always sensible to look at a company's total liabilities, it is very reassuring that Meta Platforms has US$39.7b in net cash. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$50b, being 80% of its EBIT. So is Meta Platforms's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Meta Platforms   you should know about.\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +2.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has lost 0.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.67 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.19 points to a change of +35.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.15 indicates a change of +14.6% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n12 Month EPS\nProjected Revenue Growth\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $38.15 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +19.2%. The $158.97 billion and $179.82 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.8% and +13.1%, respectively.\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $36.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.3%. EPS of $4.71 for the same period compares with $2.64 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.48%. The EPS surprise was +9.03%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nValuation\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nBottom Line\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is under fire for allegedly withholding information from federal regulators during the reviews of its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, according to a recent court filing by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\nThe FTC is pushing to dismantle the social media conglomerate through an ongoing lawsuit, Bloomberg reported.\nMeta, previously known as Facebook, led by Mark Zuckerberg, acquired Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The FTC examined both deals at the time, Instagram through a thorough review and WhatsApp via a brief 30-day check.\nHowever, the agency has since been criticized for approving these transactions, leading to a 2020 lawsuit alleging that Meta monopolized the social networking market by buying emerging competitors.\nIn its latest filing, the FTC claims that Meta withheld crucial information during the original acquisition reviews. \"The FTC now has available vastly more evidence, including pre-acquisition documents Meta did not provide in 2012 and 2014,\" the filing states.\nThe FTC argues that the limited review requested by Meta at the time was insufficient.\nAlso Read: Meta Faces EU Investigation Over Child Safety Concerns: Report\nMeta, seeking to have the case dismissed before it goes to trial, contends that its substantial investments in Instagram and WhatsApp have greatly benefited consumers.\n\"The evidence instead shows that Meta faces fierce competition and that Meta's significant investment of time and resources in Instagram and WhatsApp has benefited consumers by making the apps into the services millions of users enjoy today for free,\" said Meta spokesperson Chris Sgro.\nInstagram has been pivotal to Meta's success, generating $16.5 billion in revenue in the first half of 2022, almost 30% of the company's total revenue.\nDespite this, the FTC alleges Meta has increased the ad load on Instagram and Facebook and neglected to innovate and improve Instagram's features.\nThis isn't the first time Meta has been accused of withholding information.

        "Author": "  KELVIN CHAN ",
        "Text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Meta wants to use data from users in privacy-conscious Europe to train its artificial intelligence models, the social media giant said Monday as it faces concerns about data protection while battling to keep up with rivals like OpenAI and Google.\nThe company, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said that in order to better reflect the \u201clanguages, geography and cultural references\" of its users in Europe, it needs to use public data from those users to teach its Llama AI large language model.\nMeta's AI training efforts are hampered by stringent European Union data privacy laws, which give people control over how their personal information is used. Vienna-based group NOYB, led by activist Max Schrems, complained last week to 11 national privacy watchdogs about Meta\u2019s AI training plans and urged them to stop the company before it starts training Llama's next generation.\nAI language models are trained on vast pools of data that help them predict the most plausible next word in a sentence, with newer versions typically smarter and more capable than their predecessors. Meta's AI assistant feature has been baked into Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp for users in the U.S. and 13 other countries, but notably not Europe.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t train our models on the public content that Europeans share on our services and others, such as public posts or comments, then models and the AI features they power won\u2019t accurately understand important regional languages, cultures or trending topics on social media,\u201d Stefano Fratta, global engagement director of Meta's privacy policy, said in blog post.\n\u201cWe believe that Europeans will be ill-served by AI models that are not informed by Europe\u2019s rich cultural, social and historical contributions.\u201d\nFratta said other companies including Google and OpenAI have already trained on European data. Meta won't use private messages to friends and family nor content from European users who are under 18, he said.\nSince May 22, the company has sent 2 billion notifications and emails to European users explaining its plans and linking to an online form to opt out, Fratta said.\nThe latest version of Meta's privacy policy is set to take effect on June 26, indicating that training for the next model will start soon after.\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Over the past year, many Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, sold US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$473 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$477. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 9.3% of Andrew Bosworth's holding.\nIn the last year Meta Platforms insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this free list of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\nThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Meta Platforms shares. Specifically, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth ditched US$2.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Meta Platforms insiders own about US$166b worth of shares (which is 14% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\nAn insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Meta Platforms makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms you should know about.\nBut note: Meta Platforms may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock is up an impressive 169% over the last five years. The last week saw the share price soften some 2.4%.\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Meta Platforms achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 22%. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\nWe know that Meta Platforms has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Meta Platforms will grow revenue in the future.\nIt's good to see that Meta Platforms has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 71% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 22%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Meta Platforms better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms that you should be aware of before investing here.\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Meta and Apple will likely be the first targets of Europe\u2019s new antitrust powers",
        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "Meta already has good reason to be mad at European tech regulators. On Friday, it had to effectively pause its rollout of Meta AI in Europe, at the request of its main privacy regulator in Ireland, after privacy advocates loudly complained that Meta can\u2019t train its AI on the personal data of European Facebook and Instagram users without their consent.\n\u201cWithout including local information we\u2019d only be able to offer people a second-rate experience,\u201d Meta griped, calling it \u201ca step backwards for European innovation.\u201d But that annoyance is nothing compared to what\u2019s reportedly around the corner.\nAccording to Reuters, the European Commission is gearing up to make Meta and Apple the first targets of its new antitrust powers, based on the Digital Markets Act that took effect a few months ago. As also reported by the Financial Times, Apple\u2019s charges will likely arrive first, followed by those for Meta.\nWe\u2019ll get to the Apple issues in a moment, but those that will reportedly lead to Meta charges are not a million miles away from those holding up its European AI ambitions.\nIn the case of Meta AI, the problem is that the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) demands that any processing of personal data needs a solid legal basis\u2014there\u2019s a list of six potential options. Meta had been hoping that it could get away with claiming vaguely that its \u201clegitimate interests\u201d justify the use of European users\u2019 data as model-training fodder, but that didn\u2019t fly with regulators, so its only plausible option is to get each user\u2019s consent. For whatever reason, it isn\u2019t taking that option just yet.\nMeta\u2019s DMA woes are also down to data protection and the need for consent, only this time it\u2019s about tracking users for ad-targeting purposes.\nOver the years, a succession of legal cases (initiated by Austrian activist lawyer Max Schrems) has systemically removed the legal justifications that Meta can use for this tracking, again leaving it with valid consent as the only remaining option. But because few people would naturally choose to opt into online surveillance, Meta attempted a subscription gambit in which users could pay as much as $13 monthly to get ad-free Meta services, otherwise they would have to consent to tracking in order to use Facebook and Instagram.\nAs I wrote in April, Europe\u2019s privacy regulators agreed with Schrems and other activists, deciding that Big Tech platforms generally can\u2019t claim they have valid consent for tracking if the only alternative is paying a fee. And because antitrust and privacy law have been blurring into each other in recent years\u2014regulators have realized that market-dominating companies maintain their positions partly through the accumulation of data\u2014this tactic arguably manages to fall foul of both the GDPR and the DMA.\nMeta declined to comment on the Reuters report, saying it was speculative.\nAs for Apple, well, if you followed the drama of that company\u2019s sullen attempts to comply with the letter of the DMA while trampling over its spirit, you can guess what those charges will likely be about. If you managed to stay blissfully unaware of the drama, here\u2019s the gist: The DMA forced Apple to allow third-party iOS app stores in Europe, but when it did so, it introduced a \u20ac0.50 ($0.54) \u201ccore technology fee\u201d for every first installation of each app published by a developer who chose to make its apps available in a third-party app store.\nIn other words, developers were finally free to steer clear of Apple\u2019s distribution mechanism and the revenue cut that Apple demands, but they\u2019d lose a ton of money if their app was free to download, as most are.\nCompanies with plans to introduce third-party app stores on iOS, like Meta and Microsoft, complained that Apple\u2019s new fee made the concept unviable. As the DMA demands that platform \u201cgatekeepers\u201d like Apple apply \u201cfair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory general conditions of access\u201d\u00a0for other businesses, I wrote at the time that Apple was unlikely to get away with this tactic. And here we are\u2014this is reportedly going to be the crux of the EU\u2019s charges.\nLike Meta, Apple declined to comment on the report of this oncoming train, which will bring with it the threat of fines running to a maximum of 10% of global annual revenue.\nMore news below.\nDavid Meyer\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to\u00a0Data Sheet?\u00a0Drop a line\u00a0here.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Alphabet, Meta, and Nvidia: 3 Tech Stocks Beloved by Billionaires",
        "Author": "  Bradley Guichard, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "It's hard to get broad agreement on much these days, as I'm sure we all see heading into election season. But one area of agreement, at least among billionaire hedge fund managers, is that investing in big tech stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is wise. It's been lucrative lately, with Nvidia leading the way, as shown below.\nOf the 16 hedge funds analyzed by The Motley Fool, at least 10 have the three stocks named above among their top 10 tech holdings (as of the fourth quarter of 2023).\nHere are some reasons, so you can determine if they should also be in your portfolio.\nBy diving into its financial results, it's easy to see why Alphabet is a favorite of hedge funds. In 2023, the company produced $307 billion in revenue and $84 billion in operating income. It followed this up with $81 billion in revenue and $25 billion in operating income in the first quarter, year-over-year gains of 15% and 46%, respectively. The 32% operating margin in the first quarter is particularly impressive. But perhaps the best quality is its ability to generate cash flow.\nAlphabet produced $102 billion in cash from operations (CFO) in 2023 and $29 billion in the first quarter of 2024, putting it on pace to smash the 2023 figure. Cash from operations is an important metric because it shows how a company's primary business performs and how much of the profit converts to cash. Since CFO is even higher than operating income, it confirms that Alphabet's earnings are high quality.\nIt's been decades since there was any true challenge to Google Search's dominance. However, the release of ChatGPT and Microsoft's investment in bringing it to Bing were wake-up calls. Since then, Alphabet has answered with artificial intelligence (AI) tools of its own. The company has developed them for years, but they are finally coming to the market.\nGemini is its most advanced generative-AI chatbot yet, able to answer complex queries, assist with coding, and much more. For instance, if you want to update your resume, you can list your experience and qualifications and Gemini will produce a sample resume almost instantly.\nAlphabet's current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 27, close to its five-year average. With its tremendous cash flow and continued growth, the stock is an excellent long-term investment.\nMeta, formerly Facebook, is making a big push to lead the AI arms race. Meta AI is a large language model (LLM) virtual assistant capable of answering complicated queries, solving complex problems, and other functions. It is Meta's answer to ChatGPT and is available on platforms like Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\nAt its heart, Meta is an advertising company; 98% of first-quarter revenue was from advertising. The more users and more time spent on its apps, the more revenue it will make. Meta AI could keep users from leaving the app for rivals, like ChatGPT or Google when looking for chatbot-type services.\nMeta's total revenue hit $36.5 billion in the first quarter with impressive 27% year-over-year growth. Operating income leaped from $7.2 billion to $13.8 billion.\nTiger Global Management appears to be Meta's biggest fan, as 19% of its tech portfolio is dedicated to its stock. Meta's current P/E ratio is slightly higher than its five-year average; however, the average is skewed to the downside by the stock's huge decline in 2022, as shown below.\nThis means the stock is likely close to its fair value. Meta also introduced its first-ever dividend this year. The yield is small now, at less than 1%, but given the company's profitability, it could rise significantly over time. Meta's recent results are terrific, making it easy to see why it is a billionaire favorite.\nNvidia's rise to become the most valuable company on the planet is incredible, and it was built on our endless appetite for data. Nvidia's graphic processing units (GPUs) and software are crucial components for data centers and are even more in demand due to the rise of AI.\nCloud software, data processing and storage, streaming services, and banking all rely on data centers to function.

        "Text": "Shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) popped on Wednesday, gaining as much as 3.1%. As of 11:34 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 2.4%.\nThe catalyst that sent the social media and artificial intelligence (AI) specialist higher was a vote of confidence from a Wall Street analyst.\nRaymond James analyst Josh Beck maintained his strong buy rating on the stock while increasing his price target to $550, up from its previous level of $525. That suggests potential upside of roughly 15% compared to the stock's closing price on Tuesday.\nThe analyst is particularly bullish on Meta's moves in generative AI, calling the company a \"top pick\" thanks to the list of AI \"building blocks\" it's assembling. This includes its growing roster of employees with AI credentials and Meta's robust computing infrastructure. These underpin the impressive performance of LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) 3, the large language model that powers Meta AI, \"one of the world's leading AI assistants,\" according to the company. The analyst is also impressed by Meta's ability to build multiple new AI models \"simultaneously\" without any risk to its core social media business.\nThe analyst is clearly on to something. In April, Meta unveiled two distinct versions of LLaMA 3 -- the 8 billion parameter model and the 70 billion parameter model. Parameters indicate the size of each model and the number of variables used to create it.\nMeta's social media platforms represent a treasure trove of information upon which to build its AI models, while also providing data for the targeted advertising that makes up the bulk of its revenue. The advent of generative AI represents a compelling opportunity for Meta to expand its revenue base, as the company charges the major cloud infrastructure services to make the LLaMA models available to their customers.\nMeta is still exploring other ways to leverage its AI expertise and profit from the AI revolution. At the same time, the company is poised to benefit from the ongoing recovery in the digital advertising market.\nFinally, at just 27 times earnings, Meta is a bargain, particularly when viewed in the context of its vast opportunity.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

And, though the stock is off all-time highs hit in April, it\u2019s up more than 450% from a 2022 trough.\nTrading at more than $500 a share, \u201cMeta is ripe for a split,\u201d said Ken Mahoney, president of Mahoney Asset Management, referring to what\u2019s seen as a key level for investors. The stock has benefited from appetite for AI exposure, buybacks and the introduction of a dividend in the past year.\nMeta shares slipped as much as 0.7% in early trading Tuesday.\nSplitting shares doesn\u2019t change underlying fundamentals for a company, but does lower the price per share. This can make a stock more appealing for smaller retail investors and employees, who may otherwise be deterred by high share prices. It could also make top technology stocks more likely candidates for potential inclusion in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average \u2014 currently, no stock in the index trades above $500 a share.\nThe practice is back in focus after Nvidia Corp. shares started trading on a split-adjusted basis Monday, following its announcement of a 10-for-1 split in May \u2014 with the stock up 28% since then. The artificial intelligence company is the sixth member of the S&P 500 to announce a stock split this year, up from four in 2023.\nAnalysts at Bank of America think it\u2019s a sign of more to come in the technology sector. Nvidia\u2019s split marks the fourth Magnificent Seven company to make such a move since 2022 \u2014 the others are Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc. \u2014 and Apple Inc. did its own share split a few years earlier, in 2020.\nBank of America recently identified potential candidates for stock splits including technology companies such Broadcom Inc., Lam Research Corp., Super Micro Computer Inc., KLA Corp. and Netflix Inc. The analysts also noted that Microsoft Corp., though not near $500 a share, could be poised for a stock split as it hasn\u2019t done one in more than two decades.\nTo be sure, splitting shares doesn\u2019t guarantee outperformance; some 30% of stocks that split shares saw negative returns 12 months later, according to Bank of America. In addition, an analysis from Trivariate Research found that megacap companies that split shares had mixed results in the next year, highlighting slumps in Tesla after its most recent split and Nike Inc. after its 2015 split.\nTop Tech News\nApple Inc. took the wraps off long-awaited new artificial intelligence features, including a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, betting that a personalized and understated approach to the technology will win over customers.\nBillionaire Elon Musk said he would ban Apple Inc. devices from his companies if OpenAI\u2019s artificial intelligence software is integrated at the operating system level, calling the tie-up a security risk.\nBritish personal computer maker Raspberry Pi shares jumped on its first day as a public company, offering a boost to London\u2019s struggling market for new stock listings.\nSaudi Aramco\u2019s venture capital arm has deployed more cash to Tenderd, a United Arab Emirates-based firm backed by Peter Thiel, which uses AI-generated insights to help reduce emissions.\nA California lawmaker has dropped his proposed ban of social media app TikTok on state government devices as a result of a federal law that forces its parent company to sell its app or be shut down in the US.\nEarnings Due Tuesday\nPostmarket\nOracle\n(Adds stock move at market open in fourth paragraph.

        "Author": "  Daniel Wiessner ",
        "Text": "By Daniel Wiessner\n(Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Thursday revived a software engineer's proposed class action claiming Meta Platforms refused to hire him because it preferred to give jobs to foreign workers who are paid lower wages.\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 ruling said that a Civil War-era law barring discrimination in contracts based on \"alienage\" extends to bias against U.S. citizens.\nThe decision reverses a California federal judge's dismissal of a lawsuit by Purushothaman Rajaram, a naturalized U.S. citizen who says Meta passes over American workers for jobs in favor of cheaper visa recipients. Rajaram is seeking to represent a class that includes thousands of workers.\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company in court filings has denied wrongdoing and said Rajaram failed to show that Meta intended to discriminate against U.S. workers.\nDaniel Low, a lawyer for Rajaram, said that bias against U.S. citizens is a significant problem in the tech industry.\n\"We expect that this ruling will lead to more lawsuits seeking to end such discrimination,\" Low said in an email.\nThe 9th Circuit had never before addressed whether the federal law, Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, provides protections from hiring discrimination for U.S. citizens.\nThe only other appeals court that has considered the issue, the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit, said the law does not prohibit bias against U.S. citizens in a 1986 decision. The split created by the 9th Circuit on Thursday raises the chances that the U.S. Supreme Court could take the case if Meta appeals.\nConservative groups have increasingly cited Section 1981, which also bars race discrimination in contracts, in challenging companies' diversity initiatives and the hiring of foreign visa workers.\nThursday's decision could be a major boon to plaintiffs in a growing number of cases alleging bias against U.S. workers, at least in California and the eight other states covered by the 9th Circuit. Unlike Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal law banning workplace discrimination, Section 1981 does not cap the damages that plaintiffs can receive if they win lawsuits, and it does not require them to file complaints with government agencies before suing.\nApple last year agreed to pay $25 million to settle a U.S. government lawsuit accusing the tech giant of illegally favoring immigrant workers over U.S. citizens and green card holders for certain jobs. The company denied wrongdoing.\nAnd last month, a conservative legal group founded by former Trump administration officials called for a federal investigation into Tyson Foods' alleged practice of disproportionately hiring foreign workers, including minors and people in the U.S. illegally. Tyson called the claims \"completely false.\"\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Bill Berkrot, Alexia Garamfalvi and Nick Zieminski)\n"

It seems that Meta is once again blatantly ignoring the judgements of the CJEU,\" Schrems said, adding that opting out was extremely complicated.\n\"Shifting the responsibility to the user is completely absurd. The law requires Meta to get opt-in consent, not to provide a hidden and misleading opt-out form,\" Schrems said, adding: \"If Meta wants to use your data, they have to ask for your permission.

Both transactions were scrutinized by the FTC at the time before they closed \u2013 Instagram as part of an in-depth review and WhatsApp with a simple 30-day one.\nIn the years since, the agency has faced significant criticism for allowing the deals to move forward. In 2020, the antitrust agency sued Meta alleging that it monopolized the personal social networking market by buying up emerging rivals. Meta is seeking to have the case thrown out before a trial, arguing that it has invested billions in the apps and that the FTC shouldn\u2019t be able to renege on its prior approval of the mergers.\nIn its filing Tuesday, however, the FTC said the case involves \u201cinformation Meta had in its files and did not provide\u201d during the original reviews.\n\u201cAt Meta\u2019s request the FTC undertook only a limited review\u201d of the deals, the agency said. \u201cThe FTC now has available vastly more evidence, including pre-acquisition documents Meta did not provide in 2012 and 2014.\u201d\nMeta said that it met all of its legal obligations during the Instagram and WhatsApp merger reviews. The FTC has failed to provide evidence to support its claims, a spokesperson said.\n\u201cThe evidence instead shows that Meta faces fierce competition and that Meta\u2019s significant investment of time and resources in Instagram and WhatsApp has benefited consumers by making the apps into the services millions of users enjoy today for free,\u201d spokesperson Chris Sgro said in a statement. \u201cThe FTC has done nothing to build its case over the past four years, while Meta has invested billions to build quality products.\u201d\nInstagram\u2019s popularity has been key to Meta\u2019s continued success. Instagram produced $16.5 billion in the first six months of 2022, bringing in almost 30% of the company\u2019s overall revenue, according to court filings in the case. Meta doesn\u2019t break out Instagram revenue during its quarterly earnings reports.\nTuesday\u2019s court filing isn\u2019t the first allegation that Meta failed to turn over information that might have impacted the initial merger reviews. In 2017, European antitrust regulators fined Meta 110 million euros ($122.1 million) for providing misleading information about the WhatsApp deal.\nMeta has also degraded its platform for users most reliant on their apps, significantly increasing the ad load on first Instagram and then its flagship product Facebook, the agency said in the filing. It also \u201cchronically deprived Instagram of resources to innovate and improve features,\u201d the FTC said.\nUS District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, who is overseeing the lawsuit, hasn\u2019t indicated when he may rule on Meta\u2019s request nor has he set a trial date for the case.\nThe case is US Federal Trade Commission v.

The EU\u2019s move is a preliminary step. But eventual fines for breaches can be as high as 10% of global annual revenue, or 20% for repeated violations.\nMeta introduced separate, ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram in November, to ward off growing regulatory pressure over its processing of users\u2019 personal data.

        "Text": "Nobody is safe from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s now permanent efficiency measures, not even the company\u2019s upper echelons.\nAs of last year, Meta employed an army of 300 vice presidents staggered into five levels of seniority that are now the prime targets of Zuck\u2019s efficiency cuts, Business Insider reported, citing three people with knowledge of the company. In previous years, there were half as many VPs at Meta, Business Insider noted, and Zuckerberg reportedly wants to slice the roster down to 250.\nThe VP massacre comes after Zuckerberg first declared 2023 the \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d last February, which resulted in more than 20,000 layoffs that year, according to BI. Zuckerberg later made the changes permanent after witnessing employees \u201cexecute better and faster,\u201d and promised a \u201cleaner\u201d operating structure that included a flatter hierarchy.\nTo help cull supposedly lagging VPs, Meta is leaning on midyear performance reviews and formal annual performance reviews usually conducted in the first quarter. VPs who don\u2019t measure up to their peers through a process called \u201cstack ranking\u201d are likely to get the ax.\nThe VPs are also under the microscope of their superiors, who under company rules are required to label 10% to 12.5% of their reports as underperforming.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of top 10 AI stocks Wall Street analysts are upgrading. Meta Platforms ranks 2nd in the list. That's why the stock deserves a deeper look.\nThere has been much uproar about AI stock valuations and how investors are overpaying for mega-cap tech stocks that are promising something that still lies far into the future \u2014 productivity gains, real-life AI products and AGI. But the market doesn\u2019t seem to care what the AI skeptics and naysayers believe. There seems to be no end in sight to the AI-led gains in stocks. And analysts are expecting more. Goldman Sachs's Scott Rubner recently said that he sees a \"wall of money\" heading towards the market. Rubner pointed towards the whopping $7.3 trillion sitting in money market funds and said he believes the floodgates are about to open and investors would funnel that money into stocks. According to Rubner's model, the third quarter of 2024 is when we should expect billions ($29 billion, to be precise) to be flushed into the market.\nOne doesn\u2019t need to have a crystal ball to know where all of those billions would be headed. AI is the promising theme everyone is betting on and that everyone includes experts, billionaires, money managers and long-term value investors. Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that investors have been \"hesitant\" for much of the year, but they should just \"stick\" with \"what's working.\" AI, weight loss drugs and related themes is what's working these days, according to Lee.\nPhoto by Chris Liverani on Unsplash\nMethodology\nFor this article we picked the top AI stocks Wall Street analysts recently upgraded or gave bullish comments about.

        "Author": "  KELVIN CHAN ",
        "Text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 European Union regulators accused social media company Meta Platforms on Monday of breaching the bloc's new digital competition rulebook by forcing Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.\nMeta began giving European users the option in November of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram as a way to comply with the continent\u2019s strict data privacy rules.\nUsers can pay at least 10 euros ($10.75) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union\u2019s top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said preliminary findings of its investigation show that Meta's \u201cpay or consent\u201d advertising model was in breach of the 27-nation bloc\u2019s Digital Markets Act.\nMeta's model doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \u201cfreely consent\u201d to allowing their personal data from its various services, including Facebook, Instagram, Marketplace, WhatsApp, and Messenger, to be combined to target them with personalized online ads, the commission said.\nMeta's model also doesn't give users the option of a service that's less personalized but still equivalent to its social networks, it said.\n\u201cSubscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA,\u201d Meta said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to further constructive dialogue with the European Commission to bring this investigation to a close.\u201d\nThe commission had opened its investigation shortly after the rulebook, also known as the DMA, took effect in March. It's a sweeping set of regulations aimed at preventing tech \u201cgatekeepers\u201d from cornering digital markets under threat of heavy financial penalties.\nOne of the DMA's goals is to rein in the power of Big Tech companies that have collected vast amounts of personal data on their users, giving them an edge on rivals competing in online ad or social media services. The commission indicated that in order for Meta to comply, it would like to see an option that doesn\u2019t rely on a user\u2019s full personal information being shared for advertising.\n\u201cThe DMA is there to give back to the users the power to decide how their data is used and ensure innovative companies can compete on equal footing with tech giants on data access,\u201d European Commissioner Thierry Breton, who oversees the bloc's digital policy, said in a statement.\nMeta now has a chance to respond to the commission, which must wrap up its investigation by March 2025. The company could face fines worth 10% of its annual global revenues, which could run into the billions of euros.\nUnder the Digital Markets Act, Meta is classed as one of seven online gatekeepers while Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and its online ad business are among two dozen \u201ccore platform services\u201d that need the highest level of scrutiny.\nMonday's decision is the latest in flurry of regulatory activity by Brussels targeting Big Tech companies. The EU leveled its first charges under the DMA a week ago, accusing Apple of of preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. It also recently charged Microsoft with violating the bloc's antitrust laws by by bundling its Teams messaging and videoconferencing app with its widely used Office business software.\n"

        "Title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Meta Platforms vs. Microsoft",
        "Author": "  Harsh Chauhan, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) have enjoyed varying fortunes on the stock market in the past year.\nMeta stock has jumped 82% in the past year as compared to the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's return of 37%. Microsoft, meanwhile, has gained just 29%. That seems a bit surprising as Microsoft kicked off the artificial intelligence (AI) wave by partnering with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, and has been quick to deploy AI applications across its portfolio.\nMeta has also been integrating AI tools into its family of social media apps and is driving tangible gains for advertisers who are using AI to create, manage, and optimize their ad campaigns. Here's a closer look at the AI prospects of both Meta and Microsoft and which one of these two is worth buying right now.\nThe biggest AI-related revenue opportunity for Meta Platforms lies in the digital advertising market. According to a survey by software-as-a-service provider Kaltura, 69% of marketing departments are paying for AI tools already and another 29% are considering deploying the technology soon.\nNot surprisingly, Grand View Research estimates that the adoption of AI in the marketing space could increase at an annual rate of nearly 27% through the end of the decade, generating annual revenue surpassing $82 billion at the end of the forecast period. Meta Platforms offers AI tools to advertisers so they can target the relevant audience and drive greater returns on the ad dollars they spend.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Meta's April earnings conference call that the revenue generated by its Advantage+ Shopping and Advantage+ App Campaigns \"has more than doubled since last year.\" Additionally, Meta's AI tools are helping advertisers automate some of the steps in the ad campaign creation process.\nThe good part is that Meta is witnessing an improvement in the adoption of these AI-focused tools by advertisers, which explains why its ad impressions and revenue are increasing nicely. In the first quarter of 2024, Meta's ad impressions were up 20% compared to the year-ago period. There was a 6% year-over-year increase in the average price per ad. As a result, the company's ad revenue increased nearly 27% year over year to $35.6 billion.\nMeta's overall revenue was up by a similar figure to $36.4 billion. Given that the ad business accounts for almost all of Meta's top line, the growing adoption of AI in the digital ad market bodes well for the company's future. Meta claims that AI is helping drive a 32% increase in returns on the ad dollar spent by advertisers. So, it won't be surprising to see more advertisers turning to the company's offerings, especially considering that its family of apps has a daily active user base of 3.24 billion.\nWhat's more, catalysts such as AI are expected to drive stronger annual bottom-line growth of 30% for the next five years. That would be a nice acceleration over the 11% earnings growth Meta has clocked in the past five years. So, this tech stock could deliver more upside thanks to AI, which won't be surprising. Deutsche Bank predicts that the company could gain a bigger share of the digital ad market because of this technology.\nMicrosoft stock may have underperformed the broader tech sector in the past year, but the company is a solid bet on the proliferation of AI. From cloud computing to personal computers (PCs) to gaming, Microsoft has multiple AI-related catalysts that could accelerate its growth in the long run.\nFor instance, the company's cloud computing market share has started improving thanks to AI. In the first quarter of 2024, Microsoft's cloud market share stood at 25%, up by 2 percentage points from the year-ago period. CEO Satya Nadella credited this improvement to AI when discussing the company's fiscal 2024 third-quarter results in April:\nAzure again took share as customers use our platforms and tools to build their own AI solutions. We offer the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from Nvidia, AMD, as well as our own first-party silicon. Our AI innovation continues to build on our strategic partnership with OpenAI; more than 65% of the Fortune 500 now use Azure OpenAI service.\nIt is worth noting that the number of $100 million-plus deals for Microsoft's Azure cloud platform increased a whopping 80% on a year-over-year basis in the previous quarter. Additionally, the number of $10 million-plus deals doubled from the year-ago period. All this bodes well for Microsoft as Fortune Business Insights estimates that the market for cloud-based AI services could grow from $60 billion in 2023 to $398 billion in 2030.\nMicrosoft is already capitalizing on this lucrative opportunity as its Azure cloud revenue was up 31% year over year in the previous quarter, with AI accounting for 7 percentage points of that growth.\nMeanwhile, the emergence of AI-enabled PCs presents another monetization opportunity for Microsoft. The company's Copilot chatbot is now available on 225 million PCs. The company is offering various subscription plans targeted toward personal users (for $20 a month per user), business users, and enterprise customers (both $30 a month per user). The good part is that customers are willing to pay for a Copilot subscription, with the number of GitHub developers on a Copilot subscription increasing 35% quarter over quarter in fiscal Q3 to 1.8 million.\nAnalysts are expecting Copilot to generate at least $10 billion in annual revenue by next year, but it won't be surprising to see that milestone arriving earlier as the market for AI assistants is expected to see almost 33% annual growth over the next five years, generating annual revenue of $61 billion in 2029 from this year's estimate of $15 billion, as per Mordor Intelligence.\nNot surprisingly, Microsoft's earnings growth is forecast to accelerate, thanks to the multibillion-dollar AI opportunities discussed above.\nThough Microsoft has underperformed Meta in the past year, it remains the more expensive stock. Microsoft trades at 13.5 times sales and 37 times trailing earnings. Meta, on the other hand, has a price-to-sales ratio of 9 and trailing earnings multiple of 27.\nIt is also worth noting that Meta is growing at a faster pace than Microsoft right now, as the latter's revenue was up 17% in the previous quarter to $62 billion and earnings jumped 20% year over year. As a reminder, Meta's revenue was up 27% in the previous quarter, while its earnings more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to $4.71 per share.\nSo, Meta looks like the better bet of these two AI stocks based on its current growth rates and valuation. However, Microsoft seems the more diversified bet of the two, which is why investors who are willing to look past its rich valuation can consider buying shares of this tech giant as well.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta is considering blocking news content from the platform in Australia if the government makes it pay licensing fees, a company representative told a parliamentary hearing on Friday.\nMeta's regional policy director Mia Garlick told lawmakers \"all options are on the table\" when asked if the company would block Australians from sharing news content to avoid paying fees.\n\"There's a large number of channels that people can get news content from,\" Garlick told the inquiry.\nShe said Meta was waiting for Canberra to decide if it would apply an untested 2021 law which gives the government the right to set the fees U.S. tech giants pay media outlets for links.\nThe comments are the strongest indication so far that Meta would take the same hardline approach in Australia it took in Canada in 2023 when that country introduced similar laws.\nMeta struck deals with Australian media firms including News Corp and the Australian Broadcasting Corp when the law was brought in Australia, but has since said it will not renew those arrangements beyond 2024.\nIt now falls on Australia's assistant treasurer to decide whether to step in and force Facebook to pay for news content. The assistant treasurer has said he is still collecting advice but that Meta seems to respect the law only when it suits.\nAustralia's two largest free-to-air television broadcasters, Nine Entertainment and Seven West Media, meanwhile said this week they were cutting jobs, citing loss of revenue once their deals with Meta expire.\nAsked on Friday if blocking news from Facebook in Australia would amount to sidestepping the law, Meta's Garlick said taking that action would be complying with it.\n\"Every other law - tax laws, safety laws, privacy laws - we work to comply with,\" she said. \"It's just compliance would look slightly different in relation to this law if it's fully enacted.\"\nGarlick defended Meta's processes for Australians to complain if they believed the company was spreading harmful misinformation or scams, although she said its content moderation centres were all in other countries.\nAsked about Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest, who is suing Meta for showing cryptocurrency scam advertisements featuring his face, Garlick said the company had processes in place to detect and stop scams, but \"there are a lot of challenges\".\nHow could Meta call itself an advertising business when \"some ads sell lies\", asked Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.\n\"We have policies and systems and tools to do everything we can to prevent those ads,\" Garlick replied.\n(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Stephen Coates and Miral Fahmy)\n"

The new AI tools will use behavior on Facebook and Instagram to target the messages to those customers most likely to be receptive to them, provided the customers use the same opted-in phone number across accounts.\nWhatsApp's head of strategic markets Guilherme Horn told Reuters that these AI tools would give business the possibility to optimize ad delivery to users most likely to engage. \"This is very important for business because they are paying for those messages.\"\nMeta has been ramping up efforts to earn money off WhatsApp, its biggest app in terms of daily users. Despite the service's popularity and its eye-popping $22 billion acquisition price tag in 2014, to date it has contributed only a sliver to Meta's total revenue.\nAt the conference, Meta also introduced a new AI chatbot to answer business inquiries directly in chat, an early test of Zuckerberg's goal to convince businesses to outsource their communications to automated tools.\nThe chatbot will assist users with common requests such as finding catalogs or consulting business hours, similar to existing AI-powered customer service platforms.\nIt also announced it's adding Brazil's instantaneous digital payment method PIX, once seen as a potential competitor, to its WhatsApp payment tool in the country.\nPIX, designed by central bank, has represented about 39% of the transactions made in Brazil last year, and offers similar services than WhatsApp payments tool, such as money transferences between individuals and purchases from companies.\nWhatsApp similarly started offering payment services from rival providers in India last year.\n(Reporting by Andre Romani and Dani Morera in Sao Paulo; Writing by Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Aurora Ellis)\n"

WhatsApp already includes an AI-powered assistant for regular users, but these new products were built specifically for businesses that regularly handle customer service queries and interactions. The new features will support more than 200 million businesses that rely on WhatsApp to chat with their customers, the company said.\n\u201cAny business should be able to quickly stand up an agent that can talk to your customers, provide support and facilitate commerce,\u201d Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday when he announced the new assistant during an event in S\u00e3o Paulo.\nWhatsApp, which has more than 2 billion users worldwide, is particularly popular in places like Brazil, India, Indonesia and Mexico, where it\u2019s common for people to chat with local businesses using the service. More than 120 million people use WhatsApp in Brazil each month, for example.\nThe company also plans to launch a version of its consumer-focused Meta AI assistant in Portuguese next month. Meta AI, which is powered by the company\u2019s large language model known as Llama, can answer users\u2019 questions across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\nMeta, which acquired WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion, has been searching for more ways to monetize its popular messaging app. A Business version of the app is currently free, but offers some paid features. The company also makes money by charging businesses to send some messages to their customers, and by selling ads on Instagram and Facebook that link to a WhatsApp chat, called click-to-message ads.\nMarketers will soon be able to create those ads using AI, the company announced Thursday. Meta is currently testing that feature in English-speaking markets such as the US and Singapore, with plans to expand further. Zuckerberg has previously said that click-to-message ads could generate $10 billion annually for Meta.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAs Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks\nFood Companies Hope You Won\u2019t Notice Shortages Are Raising Prices\nChina\u2019s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\nTesla Shareholders Face the $56 Billion Question\nLegacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Author": "  Chris Morris ",
        "Text": "Mindlessly scrolling through Instagram could be about to get a good bit more difficult as Meta is reportedly testing non-skippable ad in the social media app\u2019s feed.\nTechCrunch reports the ads are already showing up for some users. As you scroll down the page, you\u2019ll come across what the site is calling an \u201cad break,\u201d which locks scrolling and requires the user to watch an ad which takes a few seconds.\nUnskippable ads are commonplace on YouTube, but this is the first time they\u2019ve been inserted into a scrolling formatted social media channel. (Instagram has had ads in its Reels section for some time, but those remain skippable. The new ads are part of the user\u2019s main feed.)\nUsers who click the information icon next to the ads see a message reading, \u201cYou\u2019re seeing an ad break. Ad breaks are a new way of seeing ads on Instagram. Sometimes you may need to view an ad before you keep browsing.\u201d\nReaction, predictably, has been negative among users who have encountered the ads.\n\u201cI hate this new \u2018feature\u2019 so much\u2014it is so in your face and to me, feels like a terrible business decision,\u201d wrote one user on Reddit. \u201cThe whole platform is already basically \u2018soft ads\u2019 that generate revenue based on people being on there for ages, consuming content without thinking too much about it all and now they're forcing users to stop scrolling and drawing attention to the fact they're on an app designed to sell them things. So far, I simply close the app as soon as an ad break pops up and if this continues, I'll be unsubscribing.\u201d\nInstagram is hardly hurting financially. In April, court filings showed the Meta division already makes more money on advertising than YouTube. In 2020, the filings showed, Instagram made $22 billion in ad revenue, while YouTube made $19.7 billion. In 2019, Instagram took in $17.9 billion. YouTube earned $15.1 billion.\nInstagram is responsible for roughly one-third of Meta\u2019s revenues, though, which could be why the company is looking to boost that income.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Billionaires Are Selling Meta and Buying This Stock Instead",
        "Author": "  Ryan Downie, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Billionaire stock transactions can be valuable data for investors. You shouldn't expect to uncover any enormous secrets that reveal infallible strategies shared universally among the ultra-wealthy. However, you can gain important insights about the factors that are influencing sophisticated investors based on the stocks that are being purchased or sold most heavily by hedge funds and billionaires.\nThere's been a flurry of recent hedge-fund selling activity for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META). Numerous billionaires and high-profile funds, including Steven Cohen, Andreas Halvorsen, Lee Ainslie, Ken Griffin, Jonathan Soros, and David Tepper, have all unloaded a large volume of shares in recent months.\nMeta's recent first-quarter earnings report was strong but mostly in line with analyst expectations. The company achieved 27% revenue growth and more than doubled its quarterly profits over the prior year.\nMeta reported higher user volume, more advertisement interactions, and more revenue per advertisement. That's a comprehensive set of improvements across its various revenue-driving components.\nMeta shares dropped steeply following the earnings report, despite the strong headline figures. The company's second-quarter outlook fell roughly 1.5% below consensus analyst expectations, and it also revised its full-year operating expense forecasts higher. Meta's sales guidance implies 18% annual growth next quarter, which marks a significant slowdown from the most recent results.\nIt's odd to see such a big sell-off following quarterly earnings that were overall positive or neutral. Meta did phenomenal work to stimulate growth while slashing costs in recent years. Those sorts of improvements are impossible to replicate year after year, but building incrementally on last year's improvements wasn't good enough for many investors.\nThis is evidence of unsustainably aggressive expectations and a \"what have you done for me lately?\" attitude from many shareholders. Meta's strong operational results and big returns have attracted a crowd of traders and short-term investors who piled in on the momentum. That's a recipe for volatility, as we saw after the last earnings report.\nIt's important to note that many of Meta's sellers still maintain large positions and that multiple billionaires and hedge funds have increased their Meta positions lately. Just recognize that the activity is skewed toward selling and reduced positions.\nThat's likely motivating many long-term investors to reassess their situations. Meta has returned 322% since the start of 2023, crushing the Nasdaq Composite's impressive 73% return over the same period.\nThat's led to rapid inflation in the stock's important valuation ratios. Meta's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free-cash flow ratio have roughly doubled year to date, climbing above 25. Neither is particularly expensive relative to the company's growth outlook, but the stock is no longer the glaring value buy it was last year.\nVolatility is up, analyst expectations are more difficult to meet, growth is slowing, the stock is more expensive, and there's less low-hanging fruit to drive operational improvements. It's not hard to see why some billionaires took this opportunity to lock in their significant gains over the past year and redeploy capital elsewhere.\nIt seems that billionaires and hedge funds haven't tired of the \"Magnificent Seven\" quite yet, with one of Meta's peers attracting attention. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a landing spot for some high-profile investors. Stanley Druckenmiller and Andreas Halvorsen opened large new positions, while Yan Huo, Paul Tudor Jones, Ray Dalio, Steven Schonfield, David Shaw, and Ken Griffin added significantly to their existing stakes.\nApple reported a 4% decline in revenue in its most recent quarterly financial report, with noteworthy weakness in the Chinese market and a discouraging outlook for iPhone sales. However, it posted its highest all-time earnings per share (EPS) and beat Wall Street's forecasts for sales and profits.\nLike many of its tech peers, Apple has cut operating expenses without hampering sales performance. It's also achieving record service revenues, which are recurring and have higher profit margins than device sales. That's important for predictable cash-flow generation.\nUntil May, Apple's recent performance in the stock market was less impressive. Shares fell roughly 10% from the start of 2023 through April 2024. Its forward P/E ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio bottomed at approximately 25 earlier this year.\nApple's most recent financial data wasn't particularly encouraging, compared to Meta's, but there's a clear trend in the assessments by billionaire investors. Meta's rising valuation ratios met Apple's falling ratios, then the two stocks promptly switched courses. The timing of that reversal coincides with noteworthy hedge fund transaction activity.\nBillionaire investors don't always get it right. However, hedge fund managers and ultra-high-net-worth people have access to resources and information that are often unavailable to the general public.\nTransaction data suggests that sophisticated investors were assessing valuation and outlook, leading many to sell Meta and buy Apple. Don't just follow these moves blindly -- make sure that you consider the logic behind the trends.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "By Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) - A U.S. judge rejected Meta Platforms' bid to dismiss a lawsuit by billionaire Australian mining magnate Andrew Forrest over scam Facebook advertisements that show him promoting fake cryptocurrency and other fraudulent investments.\nIn a decision on Monday, U.S. District Judge Casey Pitts in San Jose, California said Australia's second-richest person can try to prove that Meta's negligence in allowing the ads breached its duty to operate in a commercially reasonable manner.\nForrest can also try to prove that his name and likeness was misappropriated by Meta, and not just by fraudsters behind the bogus ads.\n\"Dr. Forrest claims that Meta profited more from ads that included his likeness than it would have if the ads had not,\" Pitts wrote. \"This is enough to adequately plead that the alleged misappropriation was to Meta's advantage.\"\nLawyers for Meta declined to comment on Tuesday.\nThe Palo Alto, California-based company had argued that Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act immunized it from liability as a publisher of third-party content.\nBut the judge said Forrest's claims \"present a factual dispute regarding whether Meta's ad systems were neutral tools that anyone could use (or misuse) or whether the tools themselves contributed to the content of the ads.\"\nForrest said more than 1,000 of the ads appeared on Facebook in Australia between April and November 2023, leading to millions of dollars in losses for victims.\nThe 62-year-old is executive chairman of iron ore producer Fortescue Metals Group, and with his family is worth US$16.5 billion (AUD$24.8 billion), according to Forbes magazine.\nIn a statement, Forrest said Pitts' decision was the first where a social media company was unable to invoke Section 230 immunity in a U.S. civil case over its advertising business.\n\"This is a crucial strategic victory in the battle to hold Facebook accountable,\" he said.\nForrest is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.\nIn April, Australian prosecutors declined to pursue criminal charges that he brought against Meta in that country over scam cryptocurrency ads.\nForrest had sued under Australian laws that let individuals criminally prosecute foreign companies upon receiving prosecutors' consent.\nThe case is Forrest v Facebook Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-03699.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy)\n"

Bond Markets Say Maybe Forever\nTech Hits Stocks as Nvidia Extends Selloff to 13%: Markets Wrap\nThe two companies aren\u2019t in discussions about using Meta\u2019s Llama chatbot in an AI partnership and only held brief talks in March, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the situation is private. The dialogue about a partnership didn\u2019t reach any formal stage, and Apple has no active plans to integrate Llama.\nThe preliminary talks occurred around the time Apple started hashing out deals to use OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Gemini in its products. The iPhone maker announced the ChatGPT agreement earlier this month and said it was expecting to offer Gemini in the future.\nApple decided not to move forward with formal Meta discussions in part because it doesn\u2019t see that company\u2019s privacy practices as stringent enough, according to the people. Apple has spent years criticizing Meta\u2019s technology, and integrating Llama into the iPhone would have been a stark about-face.\nApple also sees ChatGPT as a superior offering. Google, meanwhile, is already a partner for search in Apple\u2019s Safari web browser, so a future Gemini deal would build on that relationship.\nSpokespeople for Apple and Meta declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the two companies were in talks about an AI partnership.\nApple unveiled a suite of artificial intelligence features at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10. The new technology \u2014 called Apple Intelligence \u2014 includes homegrown tools for summarizing notifications, transcribing voice memos and generating custom emoji.\nBut Apple\u2019s chatbot technology isn\u2019t as advanced as that of rivals, prompting it to seek out partners. The company also believes that customers will want the ability to switch between different chatbots depending on their needs, similar to how they might hop between Google and Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Bing for searches.\nApple continues to talk to AI startup Anthropic about eventually adding that company\u2019s chatbot as an option, the people said. Apple Intelligence will begin rolling out later this year as part of operating systems for the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\nThe current deal with OpenAI doesn\u2019t involve money swapping hands, but Apple will allow paying ChatGPT customers to access their subscriptions within the iOS operating system. That could generate revenue for OpenAI, a percentage of which could be headed to Apple in the form of App Store commissions.\nMeta and Apple were on friendlier terms a decade ago, when the iPhone maker was integrating Facebook into iOS. But the companies have become fierce rivals in recent years, competing over AI, home devices and mixed-reality headsets.\n\u2014With assistance from Kurt Wagner.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election\nCorporate Women\u2019s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash\nWhy BYD\u2019s Wang Chuanfu Could Be China\u2019s Version of Henry Ford\nHow to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Europe\u2019s privacy laws put Meta in a tight spot. Now its antitrust laws are going in for the kill",
        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "A week ago, Apple became the first company to face preliminary charges under the EU\u2019s new Big Tech antitrust law, the Digital Markets Act. Now, again as predicted, it\u2019s Meta\u2019s turn.\nThough they involve the same law, the two cases are in many ways very different.\nApple stands accused primarily of making it difficult and overly expensive for app developers to steer their iOS users to cheaper deals off the platform, where Apple doesn\u2019t get to take its lucrative revenue cut. Meta, however, is in trouble for charging a hefty monthly fee to Facebook and Instagram users who won\u2019t \u201cconsent\u201d to being surveilled across Meta and third-party services for ad-targeting purposes. This allegedly violates the DMA because, in the words of the European Commission:\n\u201c[Meta\u2019s model] does not allow users to opt for a service that uses less of their personal data\u00a0but is otherwise equivalent to the \u2018personalized ads\u2019 based service [and because it] does not allow users to exercise their right to freely consent\u00a0to the combination of their personal data.\u201d\nOne case is about restricting developers; the other about railroading users. However, both take aim at core business models. Apple still earns most of its money from selling iPhones, but services (including App Store commissions) are the second-most important part of its revenue mix, and perhaps one day the most important. The data of Meta\u2019s users is and probably always will be its lifeblood. Both cases therefore have enormous ramifications for their targets\u2019 future revenue flows.\nWhat the Commission is doing to Meta is essentially data-protection enforcement through antitrust means.\nThe DMA\u2019s rules reflect the increasing tendency of tech antitrust regulators to treat piles of data like the moat-building competitive asset they are. The Commission mentions \u201cpotential advantages compared to competitors who don't have access to such a vast amount of data, thereby raising high barriers to providing online advertising services and social network services.\u201d However, while there\u2019s a solid theoretical basis to this trend, it\u2019s hard to escape the idea that regulators are also taking this tack because others have failed.\nWhat Meta has done here isn\u2019t just allegedly illegal under the DMA; it also very likely violates the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect over six years ago. But enforcement of the GDPR has been patchy and achingly slow, largely because it\u2019s the responsibility of underfunded national privacy regulators (the Irish Data Protection Commission in Meta\u2019s case.) To avoid this problem, the DMA puts the European Commission itself in the role of enforcer, while also demanding a resolution to the case within a year of the investigation opening\u2014which, for both Meta and Apple, makes next March the deadline for averting disaster.\nThe DMA also threatens much higher fines than the GDPR\u2019s 4% of global annual revenue\u2014up to 10%, or even 20% if the company persistently breaks the rules.\nFunnily enough, Meta only attempted its pay-or-consent tactic because GDPR-based court rulings removed all its other legal options for profiting off its users\u2019 data without their actual free consent. \u201cSubscription for no ads follows the direction of the highest court in Europe,\u201d Meta protested in a statement this morning that also claimed its model \u201ccomplies with the DMA.\u201d\nSo, in a sense, privacy law corralled Meta into this position, and now antitrust law is going in for the kill.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 5, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Meta Platforms META, Vistra VST, Super Micro Computer SMCI and Arm Holdings ARM.\nThough investors may have forgotten by now, the 2022 tech bear market was brutal for U.S. equities. The sugar high from government spending led to several adverse factors. Forty-year highs in inflation spurred Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to change the Fed's multi-year (and seemingly never-ending) \"Dovish\" monetary stance to a complete 180-degree turn.\nIn an attempt to quell rampant inflation and provide an oasis for the regional banking sector (which was on the brink of failure), Powell hiked interest rates at a dizzying speed. In turn, high-valuation growth stocks got pummeled, and the Nasdaq 100lost a third of its value.\nThough the bear market was brutal for Wall Street, America's history illustrates that bear markets ultimately transform into opportunities for investors wise enough to have liquidity. That's because America's best and brightest minds never stop innovating. In other words, innovation leads to earnings growth, and EPS growth sparks share prices.\nThe launch of OpenAI and ChatGPT Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot marked the turning point for the tech sector and the U.S. equities market. Within weeks of its launch, ChatGPT grew like wildfire and became the fastest consumer software app to eclipse the 100-million user mark in history.\nThough there are no signs that the AI revolution is slowing, investors should learn lessons from what we have seen thus far -- because history tends to repeat itself.\n1. Invest in Leaders, Avoid Laggards \nWhen a mega-trend captures the public's interest, it can be easy for investors to be less selective. For example, in the heat of the internet bubble in the late 1990s, investors bid up any stock with a \".com\" in its name. However, over time, the institutional-backed stocks with solid fundamentals and robust earnings growth provide the most sustainable moves. For example, Nvidia, which is up nearly 200% over the past year, has grown EPS at a juicy triple-digit clip for four straight quarters and has deep-pocketed institutional backers like Fidelity.\nConversely, unprofitable, non-institutional quality AI companies are dramatically underperforming tech leaders like Meta Platforms.\n2. Look for Companies Selling \"The Picks and Shovels\"\nDuring the gold rush, innovative entrepreneurs became rich by selling the picks and shovels rather than searching for the gold itself.\nAgain, history repeats itself on Wall Street. Investors are beginning to understand how much energy will be required to run the data centers needed for the AI revolution. Utilities like Vistra are all less obvious ways savvy investors have cashed in on the rush.\n3. Trends Tend to Persist\nGrowth investing legend William O'Neil once pointed out, \"It is one of the great paradoxes of the stock market that what seems too high usually goes higher, and what seems too low usually goes lower.\" I have found this quote to be accurate. Investors do not need to catch bottoms to be successful. Instead, they can latch on to momentum trades and manage downside risk.Super Micro Computer gained nearly 250% in 2023. However, the stock was far from done. SMCI quadrupled in early 2024 before retreating recently.\n4. Valuation is Not a Timing Tool\nAn important lesson is that valuation metrics like the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio are not a valid timing tool \u2013 especially for innovative growth stocks. While the numerator (price) is known, the denominator (sales) is not known (moving forward).\nBecause of this misconception, Zacks Investment Research heavily weights its analysis and ratings based on forward EPS expectations. Amateur investors would probably be surprised to find that NVDA's p/s has actually fallen since mid-2023 despite the massive bull move in the stock.\n5. Moving Averages are a Trend Guide\nThe 10-week moving average is a fantastic trend guide for intermediate growth investors because institutional investors tend to support stocks at this level if they intend to increase their position. AI play Arm Holdings is a perfect example of the power of the 10-week average. Investors who only held onto the stock when it trended above the 10-week captured much of the gains while avoiding disaster.\nEach moment on Wall Street is unique. However, history tends to rhyme when it comes to megatrends.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 27, 2024 \u2013 Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, \"For Q2, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.2% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2022.\"\nNote: The following is an excerpt from this week\u2019s Earnings Trends report. You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here>>>\nHere are the key points:\nThe setup for the Q2 earnings season, whose early reports have started trickling in, is one of continued resilience coupled with a steadily improving outlook. Given the favorable revisions trend ahead of this reporting cycle, we will be looking for further improvement in the earnings outlook.\nFor 2024 Q2, S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.2% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues. This will be the highest earnings growth rate since the +9.9% growth rate in the first quarter of 2022.\nEarnings growth for the Energy sector is on track to turn positive in Q2 after remaining in negative territory over the preceding four quarters.\nQ2 earnings for the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 companies are expected to be up +25.5% from the same period last year on +13.1% higher revenues. Excluding the \u2018Mag 7\u2019, Q2 earnings growth for the rest of the index drops to +4.6% (from +8.2%).\nQ2 earnings growth for the index drops to +5.6% from +8.2% if the Tech sector\u2019s +15.5% growth is excluded.\nRegular readers of our earnings commentary are familiar with our favorable take on the overall earnings picture. A big part of our positive view reflects developments on the revisions front, both for the current period (2024 Q2) as well as the remainder of the year.\nAs noted earlier, the current +8.2% earnings growth expected for the S&P 500 index is barely down from where the growth rate stood at the start of the period.\nIn addition to the Energy sector, Q2 estimates have increased for the Tech, Utilities, Transportation, and Autos sectors, helping partly offset negative cuts for the other sectors.\nThe revisions trend for the Tech sector has been positive for a while now, which is important since the sector alone is on track to bring in almost 30% of all S&P 500 earnings over the coming four-quarter period.\nThe 2024 Q2 quarter will be the fourth consecutive quarter of robust Tech sector earnings growth, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up +15.5% from the same period last year.\nFor full-year 2024, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up +17.3%, followed by another strong showing expected next year.\nSome of the major Tech stocks that have led the market\u2019s gains this year are also experiencing positive estimate revisions.\nTake, for example, Meta Platforms META and Nvidia Corp. NVDA. The current $20.16 per share earnings estimate for META for this year is up from $17.64 at the start of the year and $14.92 on June 30th, 2023. The magnitude of positive revisions to NVDA\u2019s estimates is in a league of its own.\nWe will be closely watching how the revisions trend for the space unfolds as the Q2 reporting cycle really gets going, but early results from the likes of Oracle ORCL and Adobe ADBE suggest that we can expect continued favorable momentum here.\nA big contributing factor to the Tech sector\u2019s positive earnings outlook is the sector\u2019s margins outlook.\nWe are already in record territory with Tech sector margins, with 2024 margins expected to exceed last year\u2019s record level. The expectation is for some more gains next year and the year after, with the ever-growing share of higher-margin software and services in the overall Tech earnings pie explaining the favorable trend. Part of this likely also reflects optimism about the impact of AI on the sector\u2019s productivity.\nPlease note that this year\u2019s +9.1% earnings growth on only +1.7% top-line gains reflects revenue weakness in the Finance sector. Excluding the Finance sector, the earnings growth pace remains unchanged, but the revenue growth rate improves to +3.9%. In other words, about half of this year\u2019s earnings growth comes from revenue growth, with margin gains accounting for the rest.\nOn the margins front, 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to have higher margins in 2024 relative to last year, with Tech, Basic Materials, Medical, and Consumer Discretionary as the big gainers.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Navigating Market Uncertainty: Intrinsic Value of Meta Platforms Inc",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nAs of 2024-06-10, Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $548.47. It's currently trading at a price of $492.96. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 10.12%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$17.55\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n11%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.45%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 35.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n622.62\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n930.79\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n548.47\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $588.03. This valuation indicates that the Meta Platforms Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 16.17%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Title": "New Meta-Study Highlights That Hydrolysis Prevents the Formation of Persistent PLA Microplastics in the Environment",
        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "A systematic review of published scientific literature conducted by HYDRA Marine Sciences finds that in the presence of water or humidity, the bioplastic polylactic acid (PLA) will fully hydrolyze, and no persistent nano- or microplastics will remain or accumulate in the environment.\nHAAKSBERGEN, Netherlands, June 25, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A new meta-study report commissioned by Holland Bioplastics, an association advancing bioplastics knowledge worldwide, concludes that the fundamental characteristics of polylactic acid (PLA), a biobased polymer made entirely from fermented plant sugars, and the hydrolysis process indicate that PLA does not produce persistent microplastics. The literature research, completed by HYDRA Marine Sciences, a research laboratory, shows that unlike non-biodegradable polymers, which will persist and permanently accumulate as nano- or microplastics in the environment, PLA will hydrolyze into molecules of ever-smaller size, becoming soluble in water and eventually fully biodegraded.\nThe report\u2019s findings were drawn from an initial scan of over 30,000 reports, of which 500 were identified by HYDRA as relevant and of sufficient quality for deeper review. The research confirmed that the environmental degradation of PLA is mainly driven by hydrolysis, an abiotic process that occurs in the presence of moisture or humidity. As long as these conditions prevail, the molecular weight and size of any PLA objects or fragments will continually decrease via hydrolysis, at a rate determined by temperature, until the polymer chains are so short that the material becomes soluble in water. These soluble substances, oligomers and lactic acid monomers, will subsequently be biodegraded by microorganisms into biomass, water, and carbon dioxide.\nNeat PLA and its oligomers are also widely recognized as non-toxic substances. Lactic acid, the monomer building block of PLA, is classified as Generally Recognized as Safe by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Union (EU). Many PLA grades comply with long-standing global legislation for food contact requirements in the US and EU. Additionally, specific grades of PLA have been approved and used for decades in medical applications such as sutures, tissue scaffolds, and drug administration substrates. After use in the body, these PLA polymers are safely absorbed and bioassimilated by the human body.\n\"As a society, we must work to end the plastics crisis from both ends: developing collection and waste processing infrastructure and products that are compostable, reusable, and recyclable while simultaneously choosing more responsible materials for the products we rely on today,\" said Erwin Vink, Board Member from Holland Bioplastics. \"These findings confirm that as we are growing access to waste infrastructure globally if PLA is leaked into the environment, it will not have the long-term impact as a microplastic that we know occurs with non-biodegradable polymers.\"\n\"The meta-study shows that in contrast to non-biodegradable plastic, which will persist and permanently accumulate as micro- and nanoplastics in the environment, PLA in the environment will not leave persistent pollution as long as humidity and water are present,\" said Christian Lott, Managing Director, HYDRA Marine Sciences. \"However, we must be aware that it does not belong in the environment, and it is critical that we do not use these attributes to encourage littering or slow the development of global waste infrastructure. Degradation of any material must be balanced with accumulation, or how much material is entering the environment, in order to reduce harm to the environment.\"\nProducing the biobased polymer, PLA, starts with plants as they sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide in sugar molecules through the process of photosynthesis. Plant sugars are then fermented using microorganisms to produce the monomer lactic acid, a safe, non-toxic substance that is also used to preserve foods and is produced by our bodies during physical exertion. This lactic acid is then polymerized into the polylactide (PLA) biopolymer used to make a wide range of products like cups, cutlery, bin liners, or flexible food packaging. Because PLA is made from plants that absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) and water found in nature, when it is composted, hydrolyzed, or biodegraded, the CO2 and water will return back to nature, making the process circular.\nTo follow Holland Bioplastics and its member companies that supported this study, Futerro, Total-Energies Corbion, and NatureWorks, as they continue to make strides toward the global expansion of bioplastics for a circular economy, visit hollandbioplastics.nl.\nAbout Holland Bioplastics\nHolland Bioplastics is an organization that connects parties directly or indirectly involved in the production of raw materials, materials and products, and research and marketing for bioplastics with the aim to spread, share, and make knowledge accessible about bioplastics. With the vision that bioplastics make an important contribution to the transition from a linear oil-based economy to a biobased and circular economy.\nAbout HYDRA Marine Sciences\nHYDRA Marine Sciences GmbH is a distinguished institute for aquatic research, documentation, and consulting.

        "Text": "Alibaba Group Holding, the e-commerce giant that is investing heavily in generative artificial intelligence (AI), has updated its open-source AI models with claims of besting Meta Platforms' Llama 3 model in certain tasks.\nAlibaba Cloud on Friday launched Qwen2 - the second iteration of its open-source Tongyi Qianwen family of large language models (LLM), the technology behind chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT - with a series of updates including multilingual pre-training and an expanded the context window. That means it now allows for much longer queries and answers, putting in it the league of the world's most powerful open source LLMs.\nQwen2 comes in five variations. The high-end Qwen2-72B model consistently offered better results than Meta's Llama 3-70B - the strongest open-source AI model from the Facebook owner - in various benchmark tests, according to Alibaba. Tests include maths, coding, natural and social sciences, engineering and the humanities, the company said in a post published to the model's official GitHub page.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\nAlibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, has launched Qwen2 just one month after unveiling Tongyi Qianwen 2.5, which is closed source. The company said at the time that model performs better in various Chinese capabilities than GPT-4, OpenAI's most advanced model, which is also closed source.\nThe five variations of Alibaba's Qwen2, from the more nimble Qwen2-0.5B to its most sophisticated Qwen2-72B, have between 490 million and 72.7 billion parameters. They are also trained on 27 languages, in addition to Chinese and English: nine from Europe, four from the Middle East, and 14 from Asia.\nThe rapid follow-up launch of a new AI model, with capabilities matching leading global models, reflects the confidence that the Chinese firm has in funnelling an increasing amount of resources into an AI race that has engulfed much of the tech industry.\nMany other Chinese companies, from the biggest tech giants to myriad start-ups, have been forging ahead in their own LLM development efforts, recently igniting a domestic price war.\nShenzhen-based social media and video gaming giant Tencent Holdings announced its own dedicated chatbot in late May called Yuanbao, backed by the company's latest Hunyuan LLM. Tencent said its home-grown model has gone through a series of enhancements since its launch last September.\nHunyuan has been baked into more than 600 business scenarios across Tencent's organisations, as it aims to use AI to help boost efficiency. Alibaba is also looking to leverage AI to help transform businesses.\nAlibaba.com, the e-commerce giant's business-to-business cross-border sourcing platform, has recently introduced its own AI-powered tools to help connect sellers and buyers to boost sales, Zhang Kuo, the platform's president, told the Post in a recent interview.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 17, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Airbnb ABNB, Uber Technologies UBER, Robinhood HOOD, Meta Platforms META and Reddit RDDT.\nInvesting in private and public markets are entirely different endeavors, though they share some similarities: innovation, earnings growth and sound management are integral drivers that determine investment performance of both.\nBelow are five main distinctions between private and public markets that investors must understand, including:\nWhether you're investing in private or public companies, each endeavor is risky. However, assuming all else is equal, private firms are far riskier than public firms. Private firms are often earlier in their growth curve (or are just an idea) and do not have to meet the same stringent requirements of a public stock exchange. That said, if successful, the reward for investing in a private firm is far greater because investors on the ground floor can enjoy the company's full growth and potentially take advantage of an IPO.\nA private investor or VC (venture capitalist) should be considered a home run hitter. While private investors will \"strike out\" more, they can be successful by hitting home runs and gaining a piece of the next Airbnb or Uber Technologies before everyone else.\nBecause public companies are traded each weekday on a major stock exchange like the S&P 500 Index, they offer far more liquidity. Whether this is an advantage or a disadvantage depends on the eye of the investor. For example, a private investor may be forced to hold for years before they can even think about selling.\nIn other words, if the investment is good, they will be forced to hold and can potentially catch the next multi-bagger (however, this works in both directions). Conversely, a public investor can quickly and easily exit a position they do not feel comfortable in.\nPublic markets have an overwhelming advantage in terms of access. A public investor only needs to fund an account at a discount broker such as Robinhood to take advantage of fresh IPOs. Conversely, private investors must become \"accredited\" to invest in less-regulated securities like private firms. Accredited investors must have a certain income. Furthermore, most private companies require a minimum investment, while public investors can invest any amount they wish.\nLike most investments, the individual investor's personal situation and investing framework will play an important role in which direction to take. Success can be found in both public and private investing but since most investors only have access to public markets, we will break down some common IPO pitfalls to avoid.\nBuying an IPO on day one is a bad decision for most investors for two reasons: First, it generally takes time for the market to find equilibrium or price discovery. Second, insiders and early investors can use the liquidity event to sell shares. The Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) IPO was a perfect example. Facebook went public in May 2012. However, shares did not eclipse the IPO high until late 2013.\nSolution: Wait for the lockup expiry (the period insiders must wait before selling shares) to pass, and let the price settle and form a base structure.\nIn a 2016 interview, Mark Cuban explained the problem with IPOs: \"Companies are waiting seven, nine, ten years or longer to go public and by then their hyper-growth is typically gone.\" In other words, instead of going public while the company is still growing rapidly, firms wait until growth is slow, and worse, use the IPO as a liquidity event to sell into.\nSolution: Look for stocks with a strong Zacks Rank or robust EPS estimates. Zacks Consensus Estimates aggregate earnings estimates from several prominent banks to derive a consensus estimate. Ideally, an IPO should have double-digit or triple-digit EPS growth.\nBullish catalysts are necessary for a stock to grow because competition is fierce on Wall Street.\nSolution: Find a company with a unique and new bullish catalyst. For example, social media firm Reddit, which just went public, benefits from the AI revolution because its platform is optimal for training large language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT.\nPublic and private investing each have pros and cons. To be successful in public investing, investors should avoid three common pitfalls.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

The tests will begin in the U.S.\nThe social media company's announcement comes on the same day as a16z-backed chatbot company Character.AI is rolling out the ability for users to talk with AI avatars over a call.\nIn a post on his broadcast channel, Zuckerberg noted that these chatbots will be clearly marked as AI so users are aware.\n\"Rolling out an early test in the U.S. of our AI studio so you might start seeing AIs from your favorite creators and interest-based AIs in the coming weeks on Instagram. These will primarily show up in messaging for now, and will be clearly labeled as AI,\" he said.\n\"It's early days and the first beta version of these AIs, so we'll keep working on improving them and make them available to more people soon,\" Zuckerberg added.\nZuckerberg noted that it worked with creators like the meme account Wasted and technology creator Don Allen Stevenson III to roll out early versions of creator-made chatbots.\nIn an interview Zuckerberg shared on his social channels, the CEO expanded on the use cases for AI avatars, saying, \"There needs to be a lot of different APIs that get created to reflect people's different interests. So a big part of the approach is going to be enabling every creator, and then eventually also every small business on the platform, to create an AI for themselves to help them interact with their community, and their customers if they're a business,\" he added.\nCreators may also want to use AIs to engage with fans, as they don't currently have time to respond to all the incoming messages.\nStill, he admitted that how good the AI avatars will ultimately be is going to become something of an \"art form\" that evolves and improves over time.\n\"I don't think we know going into this, what is going to be the most engaging and entertaining and trust-building formula for this,\" Zuckerberg noted. \"So we want to give people tools so that you can experiment with this and see what ends up working well,\" he said.\nMeta will initially begin testing the feature with around 50 creators and a small percentage of users, and will then roll it out to more people over the next couple of months, with the hope of having it fully launched by August.\nMeta first announced its AI studio last year at its developer conference to let businesses build custom chatbots.\nAdditional reporting: Sarah Perez\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/27/meta-starts-testing-user-created-ai-chatbots-on-instagram/\n"

        "Text": "Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT), the owner of Truth Social, has seen its valuation soar to a surprising $6 billion, even after a recent decline in its share price.\nThis figure has drawn incredulity from industry experts, given the company\u2019s modest revenue and user base compared to major social media platforms.\nMicrosoft Corp\u2019s (NASDAQ:MSFT) LinkedIn co-founder and venture capitalist Reid Hoffman expressed his disbelief at the valuation, CNN reports.\nIn 2023, Trump Media generated only $4.1 million in revenue, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of over 1,400.\nIn contrast, social media giant Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has a price-to-sales ratio of just nine. Hoffman suggested a more appropriate valuation for Trump Media would be around $40 million.\nThe sharp decline in Trump Media\u2019s share price began on May 30, following Donald Trump\u2019s conviction on 34 felony counts.\nUniversity of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter and media mogul Barry Diller have both criticized the stock\u2019s valuation, with Diller describing it as a \u201cscam.\u201d\nTMTG stock gained 186% in the last 12 months.\nWhether to sell or hold a stock largely depends on an investor's strategy and risk tolerance. Swing traders may sell an outperforming stock to lock in a capital gain, while long-term investors might ride out the turbulence in anticipation of further share price growth.\nSimilarly, traders willing to minimize losses may sell a stock that falls a certain percentage, while long-term investors may see this as an opportunity to buy more shares at a discounted price.\nShares of Trump Media & Technology have gained 187.28% year to date. This compares to the average annual return of 54.04%, meaning the stock has outperformed its historical averages. Investors can compare a stock's movement to its historical performance to gauge whether this is a normal movement or a potential trading opportunity.\nInvestors may also consider market dynamics.

        "Author": "  David Nadelle ",
        "Text": "For much of 2023, you couldn\u2019t even glace sideways at a media source without mention of the so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks. While some of the shine has come off the group as a whole during the first half of 2024, they are still among the best stocks to watch on the stock market today due to their oversized market capitalizations.\nFind Out: In 5 Years, These 2 Stocks Will Be More Valuable Than Apple\nLearn: 4 Genius Things All Wealthy People Do With Their Money\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks \u2014 Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 still dominate today\u2019s financial news after driving the S&P 500\u00a0in 2023. They account for about half of the weighting of the Nasdaq index, which is loaded with market-cap, tech-heavy companies.\nYou could easily buy stock in all Magnificent Seven stocks in one fell swoop by investing in funds like the Vanguard Growth EFT or Mega Cap Growth EFT, which include high percentages of the U.S. megacap stocks. However, if you\u2019re looking to cash in by owning stock in one of the seven, and are trying to decide between investing in like Alphabet Inc. (Google\u2019s parent company) or Meta Platforms Inc. (the owner of Facebook and Instagram), here are some things that may sway your decision.\nWealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.\nAs The Motley Fool notes, tech behemoths Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are fairly similar: both businesses rule their respective industries by making excellent products, both initiated dividends for the first time this year and both make a killing generating enormous amounts of revenue money through digital advertising.\nWhen dissecting two companies of this size, it\u2019s really easy to sit on the fence. If you believe in the potential of the metaverse and are willing to take on higher risk for potentially higher rewards, Meta might be the better choice. If you prefer a more diversified company with steady revenue from various sources, Alphabet could be a more stable investment.\nHowever, while both companies have vast growth potential and are poised to continue to change the world as we know it from a technological perspective, they differ in the details, and evaluating the direction in which each company may move in the future many dictate where you want to place your hard earneds.\nTrading in internet search engines, cloud infrastructure, entertainment, media, advertising, consumer electronics and mobile operating systems, Alphabet\u2019s main sources of income are YouTube and Google, the world\u2019s leaders in internet searching and online video content searching, respectively.\nIt\u2019s net worth \u2014 or market cap \u2014 is $2.175 trillion today, up nearly 40% year-over-year, per Stock Analysis. And Google stock has beaten its earnings per share (EPS) and sales estimates 100% of the time in the past year, according to TipRanks, making it a \u201cstrong buy.\u201d Of the 38 analysts giving stock ratings, only five have the company\u2019s stock as a hold (none have it as a sell).\nWriting for The Motley Fool, Randi Zuckerberg, former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister of Mark, feels her brother\u2019s company is in a better position than Alphabet to take advantage of the forthcoming AI frontier.\nProviding the world with social media apps like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, Meta Platform\u2019s core earnings drivers are in advertising, the metaverse, consumer electronics and social media. Meta isn\u2019t worth as much as Alphabet, but it\u2019s still got a very well-lined purse.\nIt\u2019s now ranked as the seventh largest company in the world, with a market cap of $1.260 trillion. According to Investors.com, on April 24,\u00a0Meta beat analyst expectations\u00a0by $0.39 in earnings per share ($4.71 to $4.32) and although its executives provided a lighter-than-expected sales forecast for the current quarter, Meta stock remains a good, but maybe not a great, buy. Morningstar thinks it should be selling at $400 per share as opposed to hovering around its current $432 price (Alphabet is ~$176 USD today).\nMs. Zuckerberg is correct about Meta\u2019s favorable position moving forward and Mark is bullish about investing in AI. Meta\u2019s audience is found primarily on Facebook, and in December, the company reported a daily user figure of 2.11 billion and a monthly active user number of 3.07 billion. \u201cFew companies, of any sort, can boast of audience numbers on this scale,\u201d said TipRanks.\nBut with users comes competition, and if more people \u2014 especially legions of young influential people \u2014 spend more time on apps like TikTok, it may come at the expense of people spending time on Facebook or Instagram. Meta will always be fighting for user time and advertising money.\nAdditionally, any hard regulatory limitations or rule changes on how user data can be utilized could turn an audience away. Google\u2019s plan to phase out cookies for 100% of Chrome users by Q3 2024 is already underway and will significantly change the ad strategies of companies that use them, including Meta\u2019s big platforms.\nMeanwhile, Alphabet\u2019s non-internet search AI subsidiaries \u2014 besides the fiasco-filled launch of Gemini \u2014 have already been met with positive reviews. Waymo, the company\u2019s autonomous vehicle has already put self-driving cars on the streets of San Francisco. Alphabet has also developed encouraging Large Language Models (LLMs) that will have far reaching applications for \u201cthousands of small and medium-sized businesses,\u201d according to Laura Martin of Needham & Company. \u201cGenerative AI requires a constant inflow of millions of data points each day to keep an LLM up to date, and GOOGL ingests more data than its competitors, thanks to Search and YouTube,\u201d Martin explained.\nIf you are a hedge bettor, both companies\u2019 AI investment and election year ad spending is going to go through roof, barring a major economic downturn, and both are sound investments. But thinking ahead, Alphabet is a stronger buy of the two. It is cheaper, has healthier consensus upsides and is getting all its sources homed in on the AI revolution better than many of its Magnificent Seven rivals, including Meta.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n5 Places in America To Retire That Are Just as Cheap as Mexico, Portugal and Costa Rica\n10 Best Items To Buy at Five Below for Summer\n5 Moves Every Woman Should Consider Before Retirement\nThis is The Single Most Overlooked Tool for Becoming Debt-Free\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Meta vs. Alphabet Stock: Which Is a Better Investment?\n"

        "Text": "We recently published a list of the\u00a0Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nThe second half of 2024 is here and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve remain elusive, with warnings about valuations and AI-led market hype growing louder. A number of notable Wall Street analysts have recently warned that the markets remains more concentrated than ever where just a few stocks account for most of the gains, thanks to their dominance in the AI industry. Many also believe the market is up for a correction as it has entered the overbought territory. Financial services company BTIG recently said in a report that the world\u2019s fifth-largest exchange-traded fund by assets under management (AUM), QQQ Trust Series 1, now trades \u201cwell into\u201d overbought territory based on its Relative Strength Index technical indicator.\u00a0 QQQ tracks \u00a0the Nasdaq-100 Index and it\u2019s not surprising to see the ETF showing signs of being overbought as more and more investors pile into mega-cap tech stocks in order to ride the AI bandwagon.\nFor this article we scanned the holdings of the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF and picked top technology holdings of the fund with higher Relative Strength Index (RSI) values. Usually, an RSI value of 60 and above shows a stock is overbought. We have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors with these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is an important constituent of the QQQ which is overbought now according to investment firm BTIG.

In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion. \u00a0However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it\u2019ll bode well for the stock down the road.\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta\u2019s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\nRGA Investment Advisors stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc.

        "Text": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta is considering blocking news content from the platform in Australia if the government makes it pay licensing fees, a company representative told a parliamentary hearing on Friday.\nMeta's regional policy director Mia Garlick told lawmakers \"all options are on the table\" when asked if the company would block Australians from sharing news content to avoid paying fees.\n\"There's a large number of channels that people can get news content from,\" Garlick told the inquiry.\nShe said Meta was waiting for Canberra to decide if it would apply an untested 2021 law which gives the government the right to set the fees U.S. tech giants pay media outlets for links.\nThe comments are the strongest indication so far that Meta would take the same hardline approach in Australia it took in Canada in 2023 when that country introduced similar laws.\nMeta struck deals with Australian media firms including News Corp and the Australian Broadcasting Corp when the law was brought in Australia, but has since said it will not renew those arrangements beyond 2024.\nIt now falls on Australia's assistant treasurer to decide whether to step in and force Facebook to pay for news content. The assistant treasurer has said he is still collecting advice but that Meta seems to respect the law only when it suits.\nAustralia's two largest free-to-air television broadcasters, Nine Entertainment and Seven West Media, meanwhile said this week they were cutting jobs, citing loss of revenue once their deals with Meta expire.\nAsked on Friday if blocking news from Facebook in Australia would amount to sidestepping the law, Meta's Garlick said taking that action would be complying with it.\n\"Every other law - tax laws, safety laws, privacy laws - we work to comply with,\" she said. \"It's just compliance would look slightly different in relation to this law if it's fully enacted.\"\nGarlick defended Meta's processes for Australians to complain if they believed the company was spreading harmful misinformation or scams, although she said its content moderation centres were all in other countries.\nAsked about Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest, who is suing Meta for showing cryptocurrency scam advertisements featuring his face, Garlick said the company had processes in place to detect and stop scams, but \"there are a lot of challenges\".\nHow could Meta call itself an advertising business when \"some ads sell lies\", asked Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.\n\"We have policies and systems and tools to do everything we can to prevent those ads,\" Garlick replied.\n(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Stephen Coates and Miral Fahmy)\n"

        "Author": "  Daniel Wiessner ",
        "Text": "By Daniel Wiessner\n(Reuters) -A U.S. appeals court on Thursday revived a software engineer's proposed class action claiming Meta Platforms refused to hire him because it preferred to give jobs to foreign workers who are paid lower wages.\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 ruling said that a Civil War-era law barring discrimination in contracts based on \"alienage\" extends to bias against U.S. citizens.\nThe decision reverses a California federal judge's dismissal of a lawsuit by Purushothaman Rajaram, a naturalized U.S. citizen who says Meta passes over American workers for jobs in favor of cheaper visa recipients. Rajaram is seeking to represent a class that includes thousands of workers.\nMeta, which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company in court filings has denied wrongdoing and said Rajaram failed to show that Meta intended to discriminate against U.S. workers.\nDaniel Low, a lawyer for Rajaram, said that bias against U.S. citizens is a significant problem in the tech industry.\n\"We expect that this ruling will lead to more lawsuits seeking to end such discrimination,\" Low said in an email.\nThe 9th Circuit had never before addressed whether the federal law, Section 1981 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, provides protections from hiring discrimination for U.S. citizens.\nThe only other appeals court that has considered the issue, the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit, said the law does not prohibit bias against U.S. citizens in a 1986 decision. The split created by the 9th Circuit on Thursday raises the chances that the U.S. Supreme Court could take the case if Meta appeals.\nConservative groups have increasingly cited Section 1981, which also bars race discrimination in contracts, in challenging companies' diversity initiatives and the hiring of foreign visa workers.\nThursday's decision could be a major boon to plaintiffs in a growing number of cases alleging bias against U.S. workers, at least in California and the eight other states covered by the 9th Circuit. Unlike Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal law banning workplace discrimination, Section 1981 does not cap the damages that plaintiffs can receive if they win lawsuits, and it does not require them to file complaints with government agencies before suing.\nApple last year agreed to pay $25 million to settle a U.S. government lawsuit accusing the tech giant of illegally favoring immigrant workers over U.S. citizens and green card holders for certain jobs. The company denied wrongdoing.\nAnd last month, a conservative legal group founded by former Trump administration officials called for a federal investigation into Tyson Foods' alleged practice of disproportionately hiring foreign workers, including minors and people in the U.S. illegally. Tyson called the claims \"completely false.\"\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York; Editing by Bill Berkrot, Alexia Garamfalvi and Nick Zieminski)\n"
