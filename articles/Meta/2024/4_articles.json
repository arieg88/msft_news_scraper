        "Text": "By Max A. Cherney\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Meta Platforms unveiled details on Wednesday about the next generation of the company's in-house artificial intelligence accelerator chip.\nReuters reported earlier this year that Meta planned to deploy a new version of a custom data center chip to address the swelling amount of computing power necessary to run AI products in Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The chip, referred to internally as \"Artemis,\" will help Meta reduce its reliance on Nvida's AI chips and reduce its energy costs overall.\n\"This chip\u2019s architecture is fundamentally focused on providing the right balance of compute, memory bandwidth, and memory capacity for serving ranking and recommendation models,\" the company wrote in a blog post.\nThe new Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) chip is part of a broad custom silicon effort at the company that includes looking at other hardware systems too. Beyond building the chips and hardware, Meta has made significant investments in developing the software necessary to harness the power of its infrastructure in the most efficient way.\nThe company is also spending billions on buying Nvidia and other AI chips: This year CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company planned to acquire roughly 350,000 flagship H100 chips from Nvidia. Combined with other suppliers, Meta plans to accumulate the equivalent of 600,000 H100 chips this year, he said.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co will produce the new chip on its \"5nm\" process. Meta said it is capable of three times the performance of its first generation processor.\nThe chip has been deployed in the data center and is engaged in serving AI applications. The company said it has several programs underway \"aimed at expanding the scope of MTIA, including support of (generative AI) workloads.\"\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has invested a huge sum of cash into developing its virtual and augmented reality technology and the software and social platforms to support its hardware. Unfortunately, the business doesn't have much to show for it so far.\nReality Labs, the division of Meta housing its metaverse technology, generated a total of $6.3 billion in revenue over the past three years. That's resulted in an operating loss of $40 billion. And management expects 2024's operating loss to exceed the $16 billion it lost last year. That's a phenomenally large bet on the future of computing.\nWhile Meta Platforms' detractors decry the amount of spending Mark Zuckerberg and his team are putting into developing virtual and augmented reality platforms, investors shouldn't overlook the fact that it's spent about twice as much on something else entirely over the past three years.\nSince 2021, Meta Platforms has bought back $92 billion worth of its own stock. As of the end of 2023, it had $31 billion available and authorized for repurchases, and it added another $50 billion to that authorization at the start of February.\nMeta's massive step-up in share repurchases over the past three years is an indication of the strength of its operations and balance sheet.\nMeta generated $43 billion in free cash flow in 2023. That's a huge bounce-back from the $18.4 billion it generated in 2022 and up from the $38.4 billion generated in 2021. 2022 was a bit of an anomaly for Meta, as a pullback in advertising spending combined with Meta's massive increase in capital expenditures curbed its financial results. However, the return to growth in 2023 indicates the long-term strength of Meta's business.\nImportantly, Meta's capital expenditures are mostly related to its Family of Apps business, not Reality Labs. It's spending on data centers and servers is for its artificial intelligence, which powers everything from its ads business to its content recommendation algorithm. Reality Labs spending is mostly tied to research and development (R&D).\nR&D spending has consistently climbed higher, but has largely stayed in line with revenue. That said, Meta spends more as a percentage of revenue on R&D than its peers. But with a strong operating margin, that shouldn't be a concern for investors.\nAll this means Meta's ability to invest in the future, including things like the metaverse and AI, doesn't curb its ability to return cash to shareholders through repurchases and its newly initiated dividend.\nDespite numerous challenges, Meta has been able to stave them off and continue growing free cash flow over time. There's very little chance that will change anytime in the foreseeable future.\nMeta's network effect offers a protective moat. It counts nearly 4 billion monthly active users across its family of apps. That locks people into its apps, even when competitors pop up. We've seen Meta counteract the effect of new forms of entertainment (Stories, TikTok, etc.) by simply integrating similar features into its app and leveraging its network effect.\nContinually improving its products, including its advertising products, requires a lot of investments. Still, Meta has shown strong operating margin expansion, and it should continue to show operating leverage over the next few years as it ramps up monetization of Reels, its TikTok competitor (which has been a drag on its results until recently).\nWhile Meta's spending heavily on the metaverse, especially relative to the amount of revenue it currently produces, it's not spending an unreasonable amount. If it turns out to be the next major computing platform, as Zuckerberg thinks it will, the investment will prove well worth it. And given that it's growing its free cash flow, returning boatloads of cash to investors, and still spending enough to keep growing its core Family of Apps business, investors should remain optimistic about the future.\nEven after shares have climbed to start the year, the stock trades for just 25 times forward earnings. With its massive share repurchase plans and strong outlook, it's worth paying the premium over the S&P 500 for the tech giant.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

Quote\n\u00a0\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\nMeta\u2019s first-quarter top line is expected to have benefited from Facebook\u2019s expanding user base (more than 3.065 billion monthly active users) and growing adoption of reels. Increased engagement for Meta\u2019s its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.Effective usage of AI has been helping the company keep its users engaged. AI-driven feed recommendations have been a key catalyst.Reels have been a major growth driver for Instagram. Meta remains focused on growing Reels as part of its overall portfolio of video services, which make up more than half of time spent on Facebook and Instagram.Meta has been leveraging gen AI to boost user experience across its apps. AI stickers, AI-based editing tools, advanced conversational assistant \u2014 Meta AI \u2014 and others to improve user engagement.It has been experimenting with incorporating gen AI to help creators create different captions and thumbnails.Meta has also started to roll out Reels in Meta AI chats. It is also exploring ways to make Facebook more attractive and fun-filled for users leveraging Meta AI.Higher engagement levels are helping to steady its user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Asia Pacific Daily Active Users (DAUs) in the first quarter is pegged at 926 million, indicating 6.07% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for the Rest of World is expected to have increased 5% to 690 million DAUs.Regarding Monthly Active Users (MAUs), the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Asia Pacific is pegged at 1.376 billion, suggesting 4% year-over-year growth.

The consensus estimate for worldwide MAU is pegged at 3.087 billion, indicating a 3.3% year-over-year increase.Nevertheless, Meta\u2019s top line is expected to reflect the negative impact of the challenging macroeconomic environment and persistent inflation that is anticipated to have kept ad spending budgets under pressure. This is likely to have weighed on ad revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.In the fourth quarter of 2023, Meta\u2019s ad revenues represented 96.5% of total revenues, which increased 23.8% year over year to $38.71 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2024 ad revenues is pegged at $35.59 billion, indicating 26.6% year-over-year growth.\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

        "Title": "4 Reasons to Buy Meta Platforms' Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "Author": "  Keithen Drury, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Listing out your top reasons to buy a stock before purchasing it is a wise idea. First, it allows you to go back and check your notes and learn from your decisions -- whether you were right or wrong. Second, it helps organize your thoughts and gives you items to look for in quarterly reports. While the reasons to buy or own a stock may evolve over your ownership, it's always smart to keep this list updated.\nFor me, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) looks like an awesome stock to buy right now. Here's my list of four reasons why you should buy Meta's stock like there's no tomorrow.\nThere's no doubt that Meta Platforms' core business of social media platforms is steady. Meta has a solid grasp on this sector with its Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Messenger platforms.\nWhile your experience on these sites may vary, family daily active people (someone who utilizes at least one of Meta's properties daily) reached a new all-time high of 3.19 billion in Q4. With an estimated 8 billion people worldwide, nearly half of the population is a Meta Platforms user. That's an amazing statistic.\nWith how widespread Meta's products are, it's hard to foresee the company struggling. Its wide diversification and huge audience mean it would affect the world if Meta collapsed. As a result, I'm confident in Meta's longevity, as the chance of a downside is relatively low.\nIn addition to Meta's rising user base, it's also growing sales and profits nicely. The advertising market hit a soft spot in late 2022 and early 2023, but has since come roaring back. This is critical to understand as the majority of Meta's revenue comes from the ads you see on its various platforms.\nIn Q4, Meta's ad revenue rose to $38.7 billion, up 24% year over year. It wasn't just one region; everywhere saw strong revenue growth.\nRegion\nQ4 Revenue\nYOY Revenue Growth\nU.S. & Canada\n$17.78 billion\n19%\nEurope\n$9.16 billion\n33%\nAsia-Pacific\n$7.32 billion\n23%\nRest of world\n$4.45 billion\n32%\nData source: Meta Platforms. Table by author, YOY=year over year.\nThe previous year, Meta wasn't optimized for profits because its ad sales were down, which also dragged earnings down. With strong ad sales, this allowed Meta Platforms to post its best operating margin since 2021 thanks to increased revenue and steady expenses.\nMeta is succeeding as a business, and with Wall Street analysts projecting 17% growth for 2024, it's a great sign that its growth should continue.\nSome stocks in today's market are trading at outlandish valuations, but not Meta. Its shares trade for 24 times forward earnings, which isn't cheap, but it's not expensive, either.\nOutside the dip in 2022 (when Meta was relentlessly spending on its Reality Labs division during a down ad market, which caused its profits to plummet), Meta has consistently traded at a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in the upper 20s.\nThis means if Meta hits the earnings expectations Wall Street has set in one year, the stock will be undervalued from a historical basis. That's a great position and is another reason I'd want to buy the stock.\nLast to discuss is Meta Platform's Reality Labs division. This division houses its metaverse, virtual reality, and augmented reality aspirations. While some of the uses of these technologies have been somewhat gimmicky, if they could be combined with the power of generative AI, they could become must-have products.\nFor example, Meta has been working on Ego AI, which is essentially a how-to AI for tasks like playing tennis, cooking, or painting. This technology would interact with augmented reality glasses and be a game changer for how we learn new tasks. While that product may be years or decades away, if it comes out, it will undoubtedly be a hit.\nWith the stock essentially only valuing Meta based on its advertising business, any new AI technologies that Meta develops will be a bonus. All these reasons combine to convince me that Meta Platforms is a no-brainer stock to buy right now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nOn April 24, 2024, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) released its 8-K filing, detailing a remarkable financial performance for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. The company reported a substantial year-over-year revenue increase of 27%, achieving $36.455 billion, compared to $28.645 billion in the same period last year. This performance not only reflects a robust growth trajectory but also surpasses the analyst's revenue estimate of $36.148 billion for the quarter.\nMeta, the world's largest online social network, continues to expand its influence through platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. With nearly 4 billion monthly active users across its family of apps, Meta's primary revenue comes from advertising, constituting over 90% of its total income. This quarter's financial success was further underscored by a significant increase in net income, which soared by 117% to $12.369 billion from $5.709 billion in Q1 2023, comfortably exceeding the estimated $11.320 billion.\nMeta's operational efficiency is evident in its increased daily active people (DAP), which rose by 7% year-over-year to 3.24 billion in March 2024. Additionally, ad impressions across its apps grew by 20%, and the average price per ad increased by 6%. These metrics not only demonstrate Meta's robust engagement rates but also its effective monetization strategies.\nThe company's income from operations reflected a remarkable improvement, with a 91% increase to $13.818 billion, up from $7.227 billion in the prior year. The operating margin expanded significantly from 25% to 38%, highlighting Meta's enhanced profitability and operational leverage.\nMeta's commitment to innovation and growth is evident in its strategic investments, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and the development of the metaverse. The launch of Meta AI with Llama 3 marks a significant step forward in the company's AI initiatives. Despite a 10% reduction in headcount, Meta's focus on streamlining operations and investing in high-potential areas remains clear.\nFor the upcoming quarter, Meta expects total revenue to range between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, considering a 1% headwind from foreign currency impacts. The company also revised its total expense outlook for 2024 to $96-99 billion, up from the previous forecast of $94-99 billion, due to increased infrastructure and legal costs.\nMeta's balance sheet remains robust with $58.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The company's aggressive capital return program continued with $14.64 billion in share repurchases and $1.27 billion in dividend payments. This reflects Meta's strong cash generation capabilities and commitment to returning value to shareholders.\nThe company's capital expenditures for the quarter stood at $6.72 billion, as it continues to invest heavily in infrastructure to support its AI and metaverse initiatives. Looking ahead, Meta plans to further increase its capital expenditures in the range of $35-40 billion for the full year.\nMeta Platforms Inc's impressive first quarter results set a positive tone for 2024. With significant revenue and net income growth, alongside strategic investments in AI and the metaverse, Meta is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the digital landscape. Investors and stakeholders can look forward to continued innovation and growth as the company navigates the dynamic tech environment.\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Meta Platforms Inc for further details.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has been one of the best-performing stocks on the market since the beginning of 2023, gaining more than 300% at one point.\nHowever, that momentum didn't help the social media giant Wednesday night after it reported first-quarter earnings. Meta stock plunged 15% after hours on the update, even though first-quarter results were strong.\nRevenue in the first quarter jumped 27% to $36.5 billion, its fastest growth rate in several quarters, and edged out estimates at $36.2 billion. Operating margin improved from 25% to 38% as advertising growth returned and the company benefited from last year's cost cuts. On the bottom line, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share jumped 114% to $4.71, topping expectations at $4.32.\nOther key metrics also testified to the resurgence of the business, as the average price per ad rose 6% and total impressions jumped 20%. Its user base continued to grow as well, with the company reporting a 7% increase in family daily active people.\nHowever, what spoiled an otherwise strong quarter was the company's guidance. Meta called for only modest sequential revenue growth in the second quarter of $36.5 billion to $39 billion, or $37.75 billion at the midpoint, which was below the analyst consensus at $38.29 billion.\nMeta didn't give guidance on the bottom line, but the company raised both its expense guidance for the year and its capital expenditure guidance, which also seemed to impact investor sentiment. The company now expects total expenses for the year of $96 billion to $99 billion, up from its previous range of $94 billion to $99 billion, and it forecast $35 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures versus its earlier forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.\nStocks are valued based on future cash flows, so in some ways it makes sense that investors are more concerned with guidance than the strong first-quarter results.\nOn the surface, the increase in expense guidance is modest, as it just raised the midpoint by $1 billion, but investors may be skeptical about another boondoggle, since the company's metaverse project has torched tens of billions of dollars with seemingly little benefit so far. In the first quarter, the Reality Labs segment, which is focused on the metaverse, brought in just $440 million in revenue and posted an operating loss of $3.8 billion.\nMeta said the increase in expense guidance was due to higher infrastructure and legal costs, and that operating losses would continue to increase meaningfully in Reality Labs. As for capital expenditures, it cited increased infrastructure investments to support its AI roadmap.\nIn addition to the guidance, Meta's valuation has gotten a lot richer as the stock has soared over the last year or so, and the pullback may reflect that reality.\nIt's not easy to parse Meta's investment, as the spending on Reality Labs and AI represent different things, though the company sees them as connected.\nManagement seems to have no plan for driving profitability from Reality Labs, and the recent results show that the Quest 3 has been a disappointment. On the other hand, the AI investments seem justified, especially as the generative AI opportunity still seems wide open.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg touted the company's Meta AI assistant and explained how the company was working on turning the chatbot into a more capable agent that can follow more complex assignments and do things like research information or book flights. Given that nearly half of the world's population uses a Meta product every day, the company has the user relationships to leverage as it seeks to build an audience, giving it a competitive advantage.\nAt the current price, Meta seems likely to be a winner over the long term, as it still dominates social media advertising and has proven it's capable of controlling spending when needed.\nHowever, the stock is likely to be volatile over the coming months as the spending ramp-up is risky. Investors should be prepared for a further pullback, but for long-term investors, the current sell-off looks like a buying opportunity.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "The Nasdaq Composite has been on a raging bull run as investors feel confident about the state of the economy and the possibility of interest rate cuts. This robust market environment has propelled some businesses more than others.\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has been a huge beneficiary. The social media stock has skyrocketed 460% in the past 17 months. This means a $1,000 investment back then would be worth $5,600 today, a fantastic gain in less than two years' time.\nEven though shares still look reasonably valued, at a current forward P/E ratio of 25.4, investors need to know these three things before even considering buying the stock.\nMeta's crown jewel segment is the family of apps, which includes popular social media services like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. Because these services are free, the business generates the vast majority of its revenue -- 98% in 2023 -- from advertising. \nBecause of Meta's wide reach and high engagement, it has become a digital ad powerhouse, commanding an estimated 20% of the U.S. industry's market share in 2023, according to Statista. Only Alphabet is ahead of Meta.\nThe positive view is that this industry still has sizable growth potential, particularly as internet users and usage increase over time. This essentially expands the virtual real estate needed to display ads. Meta, with its ability to collect invaluable data, target specific users, and introduce AI tools, will only improve its services for ad customers.\nInvestors should also understand that the digital ad market has proven to be somewhat cyclical. As the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in 2022 in anticipation of an economic downturn, marketing executives pared back spending, which led to a temporary slowdown in the industry.\nThose four social media apps I mentioned have almost 4 billion monthly active users. That is a colossal figure that represents nearly half of the global population. This gives Meta unrivaled reach and scale.\nThe result is that this business benefits from powerful network effects. Its users are also the ones creating content, which leads to a positive feedback loop that makes the apps better over time. This is precisely what makes up Meta's wide economic moat.\nThis should give prospective investors confidence because the company's competitive position isn't likely to be disrupted anytime soon. Meta facilitates social connections and interactions, which is a basic human need that isn't going to change.\nTo be fair, anyone with some funding and coding skills could in theory develop and launch a new social media app in no time. The issue, though, is that gaining enough scale and adding enough users will be an impossible task. Why would people gravitate toward a service that not everyone else is using? This dynamic gives Meta the upper hand.\nPart of the reason Meta's stock tanked in 2022 was because shareholders weren't pleased with the company's aggressive spending. Meta's operating margin went from 40% in 2021 to 25% in 2022. It also didn't help that founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg was relentlessly focused on his metaverse ambitions.\nBut Meta did a wonderful job driving efficiencies over the course of 2023. Total costs and expenses essentially remained flat compared to 2022, leading to an expanding operating margin that came in at 35% last year. Huge numbers of employee layoffs helped in this regard.\nMeta is focused on investing more in its AI capabilities. But it's extremely encouraging to know that the business still generated $43 billion of free cash flow in 2023. And it has a $47 billion net cash position on the balance sheet, demonstrating its financial fortitude.\nInvestors looking to buy shares now understand that Meta is a leader in digital advertising that benefits from powerful network effects. Plus, this is a very profitable enterprise. All this means that perhaps it's a good idea to add the stock to your portfolio.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "One of the more useful functions of Meta Platforms's (NASDAQ: META) core Facebook site is its messaging service. So it wasn't surprising that the company's share price fell on news that its messaging will no longer be available as a stand-alone app in a top mobile marketplace in China. Meta's stock closed Friday more than 4% down in price, which was a far steeper tumble than the 0.9% drop of the S&P 500 index.\nBefore market open, The Wall Street Journal reported that a clutch of popular messaging apps were removed from Apple's App Store that day. This included Facebook Messenger, plus Telegram and Signal. The iPhone maker said this was done by request, with rather vague \"national security concerns\" cited as the reason.\nThe Journal quoted an unnamed Apple spokesperson as saying that \"We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree.\"\nFacebook Messenger, Telegram, and Signal are inaccessible behind the so-called Great Firewall erected by the Chinese government. However, it is common for people in the country to find ways around such restrictions, and messaging apps are popular. The country's authorities have historically been suspicious of these apps, as they consider them to be conduits of material unfavorable or even threatening to the government.\nThe removal of Facebook Messenger doesn't necessarily mean the removal of Facebook from Chinese society. As they always do, users in the massive Asian country will find a way to connect with social media, and if they have Facebook accounts, they'll probably continue to use them in some fashion -- even without Messenger. I don't think the sudden App Store ban is much of a threat to Meta's business.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Sanghamitra Saha ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms META is slated to report first-quarter earnings on Apr 24, 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $4.32, while the Most Accurate Estimate is $4.35, leading to an Earnings ESP of +0.62% for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company.\nThe social media giant saw a positive earnings estimate revision of a penny for the to-be-reported quarter over the last 7 days and 5 cents over the past month. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock.\nLet\u2019s analyze the Meta stock in detail.\nWhile Meta is sharing its foundational \"Llama\" models with developers, proprietary data and product implementations are still private. Meta's user data gives it an edge over peers in training their AI models. This user advantage helps Meta create engaging AI experiences, which leads to increased user engagement and higher advertising revenues, favoring advertiser ROI.\nReels are acting as a tailwind, per some market watchers. A TikTok ban would be a win for this segment\u2019s monetization. Moreover, ad spending growth has remained resilient, buoyed by higher prices.\nPer Skai, a leading omnichannel advertising platform, average cost-per-click (CPC) increased 13% year over year in paid search of the digital marketing field in Q4 of 2023. Meta proved to be a key beneficiary of this trend. Spending on product ads on Meta grew massively in Q4 of 2023. We expect this winning trend to have continued in Q1 of 2024.\nThe stock currently belongs toa top-ranked Zacks industry (top 22%) and a top-ranked Zacks sector (top 31%).\nMeta\u2019s advertising revenues topped analysts\u2019 estimates in the last four quarters for all geographic sectors, except US & Canada. In the previous six quarters, advertising revenues missed only in the September quarter in North America.\nDaily Active Users (DAUS) worldwide also topped analysts\u2019 estimates in the last for quarters. Monthly Active Users (MAUS) worldwide also surpassed analysts\u2019 estimates in three out of the last for quarters.\nWorldwide average revenue per user (ARPU) breezed past analysts\u2019 consensus estimates in the past four quarters, while the same metric emerged winner for North America in the past five quarters.\nThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial earnings growth of 63.6% from the prior-year quarter, way higher than the industry\u2019s growth rate of 28.8%. Revenues are expected to increase 26.6% versus 16.7% of the industry. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 19.71%, on average, in the last four quarters. The estimated five-year growth rate of Meta is 19.5% versus 17.1% growth rate of the industry.\nThe Meta stock has an upbeat Momentum Score of A and returned about 40% this year and 127% in the past year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nP/E (TTM) of Meta stands at 30.9X versus 34X possessed by the underlying industry. P/E of the upcoming year of the stock stands at 23.8X versus the 28.6X ratio held by the industry.\nSome valuation metrics like price/sales, price/book and price/cash flow are a little overvalued. Price/Sales of the stock is 9.4X versus 5.2X possessed by the industry. Price/book ratio of the Meta is 8.0X versus 5.3X recorded by the industry. Price/Free Cash Flow is 28.7X versus 21.7X reported by the industry.\nInvestors should not be bogged down by the slightly rich valuation of some metrics. Meta\u2019s huge global presence with a dependable user base, continuous innovation on the advertising front, which could boost monetization, a deeper focus on e-commerce advertising solutions, AI initiatives, a strong presence in virtual reality and the Metaverse make the stock a buy.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Meta Platforms Is Still Cheap Based on Its Powerful FCF",
        "Author": "  Mark Hake, CFA ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) stock looks too cheap at curent levels. Even though its market cap is worth almost $1.30 trillion at the time of writing, its powerful free cash flow could make it worth substantially more.\nThis analysis will show how that works out, including a price target based on its FCF margins, analysts' revenue estimates and using a FCF yield metric to value the company.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nHowever, one of the best reasons that Meta is attracting value investors is its return of capital to shareholders.\nMeta is now paying a dividend, having declared its first-ever dividend with its Feb. 1 release of 2023 earnings. This helped push the stock over 40.60% year to date when it closed at $497.37 per share on April 2, up from $353.58 at the end of 2023.\nThis dividend is easily affordable for the social media giant. It will cost only $5.10 billion annually (i.e., $2 dividend per share x 2.492 billion shares outstanding). That is only 10% or so of the estimated adjusted FCF of $48 billion this year.\nAnd since Meta also bought back almost $20 billion worth of its shares in the market last year, total returns to shareholders are now over $25 billion. That provides a good shareholder yield of 2%, of which 0.40% comes from the dividend and 1.60% is from buybacks.\nSource: Hake estimates\nThis helps put the stock in the same league as some of its peers. For example, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) does not yet pay a dividend. However, it spent $62 billion on share repurchases in 2023. That represented 3.20% of its $1.93 trillion market capitalization at the time of writing.\nHowever, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has spent just $20.40 billion on dividends and $20.70 billion on buybacks in the last 12 months ending December, according to GuruFocus financial data. In total, that $41.10 billion in shareholder returns represents just 1.32% of its market cap.\nSo Meta's 2% shareholder yield, including its dividend and buybacks, looks reasonable and could even grow higher as its free cash flow rises.\nThe company's basis metrics have been doing quite well. Monthly average users have climbed consistently in the last three years by 6.40% annually on a compound average growth rate basis. And this has led to a revenue CAGR of 16.20% in the last three years.\nIn fact, the total Facebook plus Instagram and What's App MAU figures are now almost 4 billion as of fourth-quarter 2023. At this pace in the next years, its family or group of products MAU figures could reach almost 5 billion by sometime in mid-2026.\nAnd revenue, using a survey of 57 analysts, could rise 17.50% this year to $158.50 billion and 12.50% to $178 billion in 2025. That works out to a three-year CAGR of 10% this year and over 15% by the end of 2025.\nMoreover, last year, Meta Platforms generated $43 billion in free cash flow. That means this is the cash the company generated after all its operating cash expenses, including working capital changes and capital expenditure spending.\nThe company calculates its free cash flow by deducting from operating cash flow both its capex spend as well as principal payments on its finance leases. This slightly lowers its FCF figures, but it provides a useful way to forecast the company's FCF going forward.\nIn the past five years, Meta's revenue has almost doubled from $69.70 billion in 2019 to $134.90 billion in 2023. This has been driven by its consistent MAU growth.\nAs a result, analysts now project revenue could rise by over 32%, or almost one-third, by the end of 2025. That will lead to much higher adjusted free cash flow, as seen in the chart below.\nThis shows the company's adjusted free cash flow margins have now recovered from the post-Covid low of 15.80% in 2022 to almost 31.90% in 2023. Moreover, based on company guidance, it is likely its FCF margin will stay over 30% in both 2024 and 2025.\nFor example, management told analysts in the earnings call that its capex spending will be in the range of $30 billion to $37 billion.\nSo using a $35 billion estimate and also its operating cash flow margin of roughly 53%, its adjusted FCF will be $48 billion this year, up 11.60% from last year's $43 billion in adjusted free cash flow.\nThis calculation can be seen in the table below. It is based on analysts' revenue forecasts, a 53% operating cash flow margin, a 30% increase in 2024 capex spending over 2023 (from $27 billion to $35 billion) and a deduction of lease principal payments.\nThe net result is that by 2025 Meta may be generating $55 billion in adjusted FCF, a 28% rise over 2023.\nAs a result of this strong FCF forecast, a much higher price target can be set. For example, assuming the company was to pay out 100% of its FCF as a dividend, its dividend yield is likely to be around 3%. This, in fact, is higher than its existing 2% shareholder yield, as shown earlier in this discussion, so it is a conservative estimate\nIt is also the same as multiplying Meta's adjusted FCF by 33.30 times since 3% is the inverse of a 33.30 multiple. The table below shows how this works out.\nThe bottom line is Meta stock could be worth $1.60 trillion by the end of 2024 and $1.83 trillion by 2025 using these metrics.\nThat implies that currently the stock is at least 26% undervalued at the time of writing, compared to its $1.26 trillion market cap. The price target is about $627 per share this year and $719 next year.\nThis is significantly higher than most other analysts. For example, AnaChart.com, a new sell-side analyst tracking service, shows the average price target of 46 analysts today is $542.13 per share. That is only 10% above today's price. However, the highest target of $575 per share is close to our price target of $627 per share based on its free cash flow margins and FCF yield.\nThe bottom line is that Meta looks undervalued, given its consistent MAU and revenue growth, even after much capex spending is factored in. The company's powerful FCF is likely to continue to surprise the market and push its underlying value much higher.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms Inc showcases robust revenue growth and solid operational income in its latest 10-Q filing.\nDespite competitive pressures, META continues to innovate and invest in future technologies, including the metaverse.\nBrand strength and user engagement remain pivotal to META's sustained market dominance.\nRegulatory challenges and privacy concerns pose significant threats to META's operational landscape.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nOn April 25, 2024, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) released its 10-Q filing, revealing a substantial year-over-year revenue increase from $28,645 million to $36,455 million. This impressive growth is a testament to META's enduring appeal and innovative edge in the social networking domain. The company's net income nearly doubled, surging from $5,709 million to $12,369 million, reflecting META's operational efficiency and strategic prowess. With a user base nearing 4 billion across its family of apps, META's financial health is indicative of its market leadership and potential for future expansion.\nBrand Power: Meta Platforms Inc's brand is synonymous with social networking, a testament to its pioneering role and continued innovation in the industry. The company's suite of products, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, are household names, commanding a massive and loyal user base. This brand equity translates into significant competitive advantages, such as high barriers to entry for competitors, pricing power, and a strong bargaining position with advertisers and partners. The brand's strength is evidenced by its ability to maintain user engagement despite the emergence of new social media platforms, ensuring a steady stream of advertising revenue, which accounts for over 90% of META's total revenue.\nFinancial Robustness: META's latest financials underscore its robust balance sheet and profitability. The company's revenue growth outpaces the increase in total costs and expenses, indicating effective cost management and scalability. With a net income margin improvement from 20% to 34%, META demonstrates its ability to translate top-line growth into bottom-line results. This financial strength provides META with the flexibility to invest in long-term growth initiatives, such as the development of the metaverse, and to weather economic downturns.\nInnovation and Diversification: META's commitment to innovation is evident in its significant research and development investments, which totaled $9,978 million in the latest quarter. This focus on innovation not only enhances existing platforms but also drives the development of new technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality. META's diversification into hardware products and its ambitious vision for the metaverse position the company at the forefront of the next digital frontier, potentially unlocking new revenue streams and user engagement opportunities.\nDependence on Advertising Revenue: Despite its financial success, META's heavy reliance on advertising revenue is a vulnerability. With over 90% of its revenue stemming from advertising, shifts in advertiser spending, changes in advertising technology, or the emergence of ad-blocking tools could significantly impact META's financial performance. This dependence on a single revenue stream makes META susceptible to market fluctuations and requires a strategic approach to diversifying income sources.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks: META operates in a highly scrutinized regulatory environment, with ongoing concerns around privacy, data protection, and content moderation. The company's business model, which involves the collection and utilization of user data for targeted advertising, is subject to evolving privacy regulations and public sentiment. Compliance with these regulations can be costly and may limit META's ability to leverage its user data for advertising purposes, potentially affecting its revenue and growth prospects.\nUser Privacy Concerns: User trust is paramount in the social networking space, and any breach of privacy or data misuse can erode user confidence and engagement. META has faced criticism and legal challenges related to user privacy, which could lead to a loss of users or reduced user activity. Maintaining user trust while balancing the monetization of user data is a delicate and ongoing challenge for META.\nExpansion into Emerging Markets: META's global presence offers significant opportunities for growth, particularly in emerging markets where internet penetration is rising. By tailoring its products to local needs and investing in infrastructure to improve access, META can capture a larger share of these growing user bases. The company's ability to scale and localize its platforms can drive user growth and open up new advertising markets.\nMonetization of New Technologies: META's investments in the metaverse and virtual reality technologies present substantial opportunities for monetization. As these technologies mature and gain user adoption, META can leverage its first-mover advantage to establish new revenue models, such as virtual goods, services, and experiences. The potential integration of e-commerce and digital payments within the metaverse further expands META's revenue potential.\nStrategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: META has a history of strategic acquisitions that have bolstered its product offerings and user base. Continued strategic partnerships and acquisitions can enhance META's technological capabilities, expand its product portfolio, and consolidate its market position. Collaborations with content creators, businesses, and technology providers can enrich the user experience and create additional revenue channels.\nIntensifying Competition: The social networking landscape is highly competitive, with new entrants and established players vying for user attention and advertising dollars. META faces competition from platforms that offer similar or alternative services, particularly those that resonate with younger demographics. The company must continuously innovate and adapt to user preferences to maintain its market leadership and avoid losing users to competitors.\nRegulatory and Political Scrutiny: META's operations are subject to intense regulatory scrutiny, which can lead to restrictions, fines, or changes in business practices. Political and public pressure around issues such as misinformation, content moderation, and antitrust concerns can result in regulatory actions that constrain META's business model and operational flexibility. Navigating this complex regulatory landscape is critical to META's long-term success.\nTechnological Disruptions\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a 1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94-99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35-40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30-37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nQ1 was a good start to the year. We're seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer-term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.\n\u00a0\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse\u00a0efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 2, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com\u00a0and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March\u00a031, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is April\u00a024, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\n\u00a0\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months ended March\u00a031, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases.\u00a0We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n\u00a0\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions,

When it comes to mobile apps like Facebook and Instagram, Meta is beholden to mobile OS creators such as Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. Meta has taken particular issue with Apple in recent years, complaining that the iPhone maker\u2019s decisions around privacy and in-app fees for iOS applications have hurt Meta\u2019s business.\nZuckerberg is hoping to avoid that situation with the next wave of devices, including AR and VR headsets, and the company is spending aggressively to make that happen.

        "Text": "On Wednesday, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) topped Wall Street estimates with its first quarter results. But, stock plunged 16% due to a light revenue guidance that overshadowed the fact its revenue grew at a fastest quarterly rate since 2021 and net income more than doubled. Like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta didn\u2019t talk much about AI, until now. During the earnings call, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed the company\u2019s AI roadmap, hinting at a shift from chatbots to AI agents, highlighting confidence in the company\u2019s leadership on the AI front.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \nFor the first three months of the year, Meta reported revenue expanded\u00a027%\u00a0YoY to $36.46 billion, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $36.16. Net income more than doubled to $12.37 billion or $4.71 per share, surpassing LSEG\u2019s estimate of $4.32 as the Facebook-parent successfully lowered its\u00a0sales and marketing costs by 16% compared to last year\u2019s comparable quarter.\nAs for its userbase metric, Meta revealed there were 3.24 billion\u00a0family daily active people in March, which represents a 7% YoY rise while average revenue per user in the quarter was $11.20.\nDigital advertising makes 98% of Meta\u2019s revenue and it rose\u00a027%\u00a0YoY to $35.64\u00a0billion. Therefore, building leading AI has a lot to do with turning those efforts into ad dollars.\nWith revenue of\u00a0$440 million, Reality Labs unit reported a loss of $3.85 billion. Since the end of 2020, Meta\u2019s most important division it based its new identity on lost more than $45 billion.\nAs for the second quarter, Meta guided for revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, while analysts on average expected $38.3 billion.\nMeta guided for capital expenditures in the range between $35 billion and $40 billion, while previously forecasting\u00a0$30 billion to $37 billion. The increase is due to accelerated AI investments.\nMeta bought some time with long-term potential of AI.\nAfter a brutal 2022 during which Meta lost about two thirds of its value and figuring out how to live in a new privacy environment that Apple cooked up. But, Meta or more precisely, Zuckerberg, made sure that sure that smaller advertisers knew that,\u00a0thanks to Apple and the privacy changes it introduced, it got more expensive to reach their potential customers. Apple and Meta feud, or more precisely, the feud of their respective CEOs has been going on since 2014, at least. But Apple is well used to attacks regarding its App Store commissions and Tim Cook often simply leaves such comments without a response. But, Meta clearly preserved its users and ad dollars, and it seems to have succeeded to restore Wall Street\u2019s confidence with its cost cuts efforts it kicked off early last year, marking 2023 as its year of efficiency. Although AI still didn\u2019t provide the lift that Meta needs, Zuckerberg succeeded to convince Wall Street of the company\u2019s AI leadership potential, which will take time to be realized through the company\u2019s financials. But, then again, Meta certainly has a strong record of monetizing its services.\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Let's talk about the popular Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). The company's shares led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The recent rally in share prices has nudged the company in the right direction, though it still falls short of its yearly peak. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company\u2019s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let\u2019s take a look at Meta Platforms\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n View our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It\u2019s trading around 18% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Meta Platforms today, you\u2019d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $583.80, then there isn\u2019t much room for the share price grow beyond what it\u2019s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Meta Platforms\u2019s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it\u2019s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 74% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Meta Platforms. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\nAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in META\u2019s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven\u2019t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping tabs on META, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it\u2019s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\nWith this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms you should know about.\nIf you are no longer interested in Meta Platforms, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "Will Meta Platforms (META) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Meta Platforms (META), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry.\nWhen looking at the last two reports, this social media company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 15.81%, on average, in the last two quarters.\nFor the last reported quarter, Meta Platforms came out with earnings of $5.33 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.83 per share, representing a surprise of 10.35%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $3.62 per share and it actually produced earnings of $4.39 per share, delivering a surprise of 21.27%.\nFor Meta Platforms, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nMeta Platforms currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.05%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on April 24, 2024.\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

        "Title": "Is Beaten-Down Meta Platforms Stock a Buy on the Dip?",
        "Author": "  Cory Renauer, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) recently presented first-quarter results that exceeded expectations on the top and bottom lines. Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook outperformed expectations, but shares of their parent company still fell hard in after-hours trading.\nMeta stock was down about 15% when the market opened on Thursday, April 25. Here's a look at why it fell and reasons it could be a good stock to buy on the dip.\nMeta stock is down partly because its revenue projection for Q2 was a little lighter than expected. The average analyst on Wall Street expects $38.29 billion in total revenue, but management guided to a range between $36.5 billion and $39 billion.\nIn addition to a soft revenue projection, the market is reacting negatively to what many investors see as another of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's enormously expensive pet projects. This year Meta expects capital expenditures to land in a range between $35 billion and $40 billion as it hurls money at a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot. A few months ago management told investors to expect between $30 billion and $37 billion.\nA new AI chatbot that can compete with Microsoft and OpenAI's popular ChatGPT service could be extremely valuable. Unfortunately, Zuckerberg's metaverse blunder is making investors justifiably nervous. Over the past decade, Meta Platforms has spent more than $50 billion trying to build interest in the metaverse with dismal results.\nOperating losses from Reality Labs, the segment that houses metaverse operations, grew to $16 billion over the last 12 months, which was $2.3 billion more than the division lost in 2022. The company can't even keep total metaverse-related sales from shrinking. Revenue from Reality Labs over the trailing-12-month period fell to $2 billion from $2.2 billion in 2022.\nUnlike the metaverse, there's already plenty of demand for chatbots. Getting folks to use a free one should be a lot easier than asking them to strap a smartphone to their face.\nThe sums that Meta intends to spend on new products that might never pay off are staggering. The stock is still a buy because its well-established advertising business is profitable enough to overcome the losses.\nLast year was a generally lousy one for the cyclical advertising industry. Despite a cyclical challenge and metaverse losses, Meta Platforms' return on assets never fell below 12% in 2023.\nMETA Return on Assets data by YCharts.\nIt's been more than 8 years since the company reported a return on assets below 10%. That's heaps better than peers like Pinterest and Snap, both of which have been reporting negative returns.\nWith reported returns that are much better than its social media industry peers, it's clear that Meta benefits from a strong competitive advantage, in this case, a network effect. Meta's profits aren't the only sign of a strong network effect either. In Q1, the company averaged a stunning 3.24 billion daily active users across its family of applications.\nThe rapid rise of TikTok proves that this industry can turn on a dime. That said, Meta's network effect appears durable. For example, you might find Facebook's incessant recommendations and advertisements off-putting, but you probably keep the app on your phone for access to local groups and events.\nMeta Platforms is going to spend heaps on AI and metaverse initiatives, but it's returning even more to investors. The company declared a dividend earlier this year that currently offers a 0.5% yield. Plus, it returned $14.6 billion to shareholders in Q1 in the form of share repurchases.\nTrailing-12-month earnings per share are up by 153% over the past five years, and the next five could be just as successful. Despite Meta's proven track record, the market isn't expecting much growth from Meta Platforms. At recent prices, you can buy the stock for just 21.6 times forward-looking earnings expectations. Scooping up some shares on the recent dip to hold over the long run looks like a smart move.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms (META) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Meta Platforms (META) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.28, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.28 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 46 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 40 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87% and 2.2% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>The ABR suggests buying Meta Platforms, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nShould You Invest in META?\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month to $20.01.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms.

More importantly, the research firm said that after a new market share analysis, it believed Meta could capture 50% of incremental ad dollars in the industry in 2024, its highest ever.\nThe analyst predicted its revenue could grow 20%, compared to just 9% for the digital ad industry overall, driven in part by new generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Meta stock (META) fell more than 10% on Thursday after CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the social media company is pouring more cash into its AI efforts, spooking investors.\nThe CEO, however, tried to assuage investor concerns about the company\u2019s spending during Wednesday\u2019s earnings call, noting that Meta has made similar moves when transitioning to other new technologies in the past.\n\u201cWe've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook, where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it. We saw this with Reels, Stories, as Newsfeed transitioned to mobile, and more,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\nBut he also admitted that it will likely take years before Meta turns a profit on its AI investments. In January, Zuckerberg announced via an Instagram post that Meta will purchase some 350,000 Nvidia H100 AI chips by the end of the year. While Nvidia doesn\u2019t release the exact price of its data center chips, estimates indicate they cost anywhere between $20,000 and $40,000 apiece. That would put Meta\u2019s estimated costs well into the billions of dollars.\nMeta CFO Susan Li backed up Zuckerberg\u2019s statements in her earnings note commentary, raising the company's full-year total expenses estimate from a range of between $94 billion and $99 billion to between $96 billion and $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. Li said that the company\u2019s investments will also increase in the years ahead.\n\"While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,\" Li said.\nWhile Wall Street\u2019s early reaction to Zuckerberg\u2019s comments may have turned off some investors, experts say the investments will likely pay off in the long run more than, say, the company\u2019s metaverse play.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Meta is all in on AI but to achieve its vision, the company must make big investments in infrastructure. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s \u2018heads up\u2019 was reminiscent of what he once said about the metaverse,\u201d Forrester vice president and research director Mike Proulx said in a statement.\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t exactly go so well, but this is different than Meta\u2019s metaverse gamble because AI has real and practical use cases now. The question remains whether Meta can contend in the AI race while maintaining a strong financial position,\u201d he added.\nWilliam Blair analyst Ralph Schackart, meanwhile, said that while the timing and scale of Meta\u2019s generative AI investments will be larger and longer than its prior build-outs, making moves now will put Meta in a more competitive position against rivals.\n\u201cWe believe [Meta] is still exercising prudence in spending and ultimately will be one of the leaders in the AI race. However, this may take some time and further proof points to investors,\u201d he wrote in an investor note.\nMeta\u2019s AI investments include two divisions, one dedicated to consumer users and the other focusing on advertisers. On the consumer front, there\u2019s the company\u2019s new Meta AI chatbot which answers users\u2019 general knowledge questions. Then there\u2019s Meta AI\u2019s customer side, which allows advertisers to build out advertising campaigns on the company\u2019s social platforms using AI.\nAll of the focus on Meta\u2019s AI investments, however, overshadowed the fact that the company still beat analysts\u2019 expectations on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, posting earnings per share (EPS) of $4.71 in the quarter on revenue of $36.46 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $4.30 on revenue of $36.12 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe company did, however, say it anticipates Q2 revenue slightly off the midpoint of what Wall Street was expecting. Meta said it will see second quarter revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion; estimates called for $38.24 billion.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Author": "  Anthony Lee ",
        "Text": "Shares of social network operator Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) fell 17.2% in the pre-market session after the company reported first-quarter results with revenue guidance for the next quarter, missing analysts' expectations. Meta also raised its forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year. The increased costs are related to the company's AI infrastructure.\nOn the other hand, Meta delivered solid revenue, operating profit, and EPS growth this quarter, which beat analysts' estimates. During the quarter, Meta released its AI assistant, Meta AI. This product was rolled out across its family of apps and is powered by Llama 3, an open-source large language model that is a ChatGPT competitor. The product is quite exciting and we recommend readers to try it out.\nOverall, this quarter's print was solid, but the weaker expected revenue for next quarter and higher expenses for the full year are spooking investors.\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Meta? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\nMeta's shares are somewhat volatile and over the last year have had 2 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Meta and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 3 months ago, when the stock gained 21.9% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, operating income, and EPS, all exceeding analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024, partly explaining why Meta had a strong quarter.\nLooking ahead, Meta's Q1 2024 revenue guidance topped Wall Street's forecast, while its anticipated full-year 2024 capital expenditures came in slightly higher. The company expects this capex growth to come from investments in servers, including AI and non-AI hardware (you're welcome, Nvidia), and data centers as it ramps up construction for its new data center architecture. These investments will be key for its open-source large language model, Llama, to successfully compete against OpenAI's closed-source ChatGPT.\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the quarter was the announcement of a quarterly dividend - the first in the company's history. Stockholders, as of February 22, 2024, were expected to receive $0.50 per share per quarter. Overall, this was a really good quarter that should please shareholders.\nMeta is up 24.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $432.05 per share it is still trading 18.1% below its 52-week high of $527.34 from April 2024.

        "Text": "Meta committed to increasing AI spending in 2024 to between $35-40bn in its earnings call on Thursday (24 April), which saw the company's share price drop 15%. The move highlighted Meta's commitment to generative AI and firmly signalled its pivot from its all-metaverse focus of the last few years.\nThe AI investment comes amid a rapidly-evolving AI race, which has seen industry heavyweights including Google, OpenAI and Microsoft roll out AI services and products at a rapid rate.\nWhile Meta did not specify how much, the company stated that it expected its AI expenditure to increase in the years following 2024 as it continues to build AI infrastructure.\nMeta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company had experienced a good start to the financial year. Meta recorded a total Q1 2024 revenue of $36.4bn, which is a 27% increase from last year.\nHowever, Zuckerberg told investors that it would take time before Meta\u2019s AI investments returned significant revenue back to the company.\nFacebook, once a social media company, rebranded to Meta in 2021. At the time, Zuckerberg said the rebranding highlighted the company\u2019s new focus on creating the metaverse.\nThe metaverse, as Zuckerberg imagined it, is a digital world where people can interact, work, shop, and play in a variety of immersive virtual settings. The goal was to make digital interactions feel more like real-life experiences, like internet shopping in a 3D virtual supermarket or holding online corporate meetings in a digitally-rendered boardroom.\nFor a moment in time, the metaverse was the industry\u2019s biggest buzzword. Technology giants such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia were all involved in various ways. Other industries were involved too, for example, Walmart unveiled its own metaverse experience.\nHowever, this all changed with the arrival of GenAI and OpenAI\u2019s groundbreaking ChatGPT chatbot. The buzz that had once surrounded the future of the metaverse dissipated and Meta was forced to pivot.\nIn Meta\u2019s Q1 2024 earnings call, Zuckerberg heavily focused on AI investments. While he mentions the metaverse three times, it is only in relation to AI.\nMeta released its latest AI model, Llama 3, along with an image generator that updates photos through user prompts earlier this month.\nThe new models were integrated into Meta AI, the company\u2019s virtual assistant, which the company said is more sophisticated at coding, creative writing and reasoning than offerings from its rivals, naming both Google and France\u2019s Mistral AI.\nMeta\u2019s new AI assistant is being placed centrally across the company\u2019s products, including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. Similar to OpenAI\u2019s popular ChatGPT, Meta AI will also get its own website.\nZuckerberg said in 2023 that Meta sees \u201can opportunity to introduce AI agents to billions of people in ways that will be useful and meaningful\".\nAt first glance, it looks like Meta could be turning its back on the metaverse in favour of GenAI, a technology which has proven interest and potential revenue value. The grand metaverse vision has not been a lucrative journey to market so far for Meta. The company's Reality Labs division, which handles all of the VR technology, lost over $13bn in 2022.\nHowever, Laura Petrone, principal analyst at research and analysis company GlobalData, told Verdict that Meta\u2019s aggressive AI spending is a needed foundation for its metaverse ambitions.\n\u201cI think rather than making a U-turn on the metaverse, Meta sees AI as a critical component of its long-term metaverse plans. Its AI investments are linked with building the foundation for the metaverse,\u201d Petrone told Verdict.\n\u201cIn particular, the AI-powered agent, which received a lot of attention during its earnings announcement, seems to be at the centre of its idea of the future of social media, providing the kind of interaction that anticipates the one it envisages in the digital universe,\u201d she added.\nAlthough virtual assistants are nothing new, the increasingly personalised agents incorporating GenAI could potentially provide a much more engaging way to reach customers, Petrone said.\n\"The race among Big Tech to monetise users\u2019 attention using AI is heating up,\" she added.\nJeff Watkins, chief product and technology officer at xDesign, told Verdict that Meta\u2019s AI investments are more of a detour from the metaverse rather than an abandonment.\n\u201c[Meta is] forward thinking enough to understand that AI can be a significant revenue stream, as well as it being a crucial player in realising the Metaverse, aiding in creating worlds, characters and interactions,\u201d Watkins said.\n\u201cThe recent announcement that their VR headset operating system is being opened up to other hardware providers shows that Meta are still moving the needle on virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality,\u201d he added.\nResearch and analysis company GlobalData forecast that 2024 will see an increased rollout of AI products on the market.\nBy 2027, it expects global GenAI revenues to exceed $33bn achieving a CAGR of 80% from 2022.\n\"Does Meta\u2019s pivot to AI signal a widespread abandonment of the metaverse?\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.\n\n\u00a0\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. Beat Analyst Estimates: See What The Consensus Is Forecasting For This Year",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Last week, you might have seen that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) released its quarterly result to the market. The early response was not positive, with shares down 7.9% to US$443 in the past week. Meta Platforms reported US$36b in revenue, roughly in line with analyst forecasts, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) of US$4.71 beat expectations, being 8.9% higher than what the analysts expected. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results.\n See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nTaking into account the latest results, the most recent consensus for Meta Platforms from 56 analysts is for revenues of US$158.8b in 2024. If met, it would imply a meaningful 11% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to expand 11% to US$20.10. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$158.7b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$20.02 in 2024. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\nIt will come as no surprise then, to learn that the consensus price target is largely unchanged at US$523. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. There are some variant perceptions on Meta Platforms, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$600 and the most bearish at US$400 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await Meta Platforms shareholders.\nAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. The period to the end of 2024 brings more of the same, according to the analysts, with revenue forecast to display 15% growth on an annualised basis. That is in line with its 16% annual growth over the past five years. Compare this with the broader industry, which analyst estimates (in aggregate) suggest will see revenues grow 9.8% annually. So it's pretty clear that Meta Platforms is forecast to grow substantially faster than its industry.\nThe most important thing to take away is that there's been no major change in sentiment, with the analysts reconfirming that the business is performing in line with their previous earnings per share estimates. Happily, there were no major changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow faster than the wider industry. There was no real change to the consensus price target, suggesting that the intrinsic value of the business has not undergone any major changes with the latest estimates.\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Meta Platforms going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here..\nDon't forget that there may still be risks.

Instead, they\u2019re alarmed.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTesla Soars on Tentative China Approval for Driving System\nHSBC CEO Quinn Unexpectedly Steps Down After Almost 5 Years\nStocks Trade for 390 Minutes a Day.

But the spending forecast, coupled with slower sales growth than anticipated, sent the shares tumbling as much as 16% in New York on Thursday morning, the biggest drop since October 2022.\nIt was a familiar pitch for Zuckerberg, who has said before that the company\u2019s futuristic technological bets will eventually pay off \u2014 and that savvy shareholders should stick around.\n\u201cSmart investors see that the product is scaling and that there is a clear monetizable opportunity there even before the revenue materializes,\u201d he said during a conference call following Meta\u2019s first-quarter earnings report.\nThe strategic pivot may have caught investors by surprise because it had embraced aggressive cost-cutting in recent quarters to boost profit. Its stock had been up 39% so far this year at market close and was trading near all-time highs for the past month.\nThe company credits AI for some of its recent user growth and advertising success, pointing to improvements within its recommendation algorithms. Meta has been one of the best-performing stocks among its Big Tech peers.\nThe Facebook parent is now plowing ever more resources into artificial intelligence, which requires significant investments in computing power \u2014 part of an arms race with rivals from Alphabet Inc. to Microsoft Corp. for supremacy in this fast-developing technology. Zuckerberg warned that the investments would increase \u201cmeaningfully\u201d and take a long time to generate returns for the social networking company \u2014 perhaps years \u2014 but urged them to see the long-term benefits that AI has to offer.\nZuckerberg took a similar tack when Meta pivoted toward building the so-called metaverse and other futuristic technologies, like VR headsets and smart glasses. Those endeavors have been pricey. Reality Labs, the division inside Meta that is spearheading these efforts, lost $16 billion in 2023. But Zuckerberg says that advancements the group has made in the past year \u2014 especially its success with its AI chatbot and Ray-Ban smart glasses \u2014 has given him confidence that further investment is necessary.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten more optimistic and ambitious on AI,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a place where we\u2019ve shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world. And that opens up a lot of additional opportunities beyond just ones that are the most obvious ones for us.\u201d\nAchieving that vision will be expensive. The Menlo Park, California-based company raised its estimates for costs for the year and now believes capital expenditures will be $35 billion to $40 billion. Earlier, it estimated expenses related to things like servers, AI hardware and data centers would be $30 billion to $37 billion.\n\u201cWe expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said in a statement, referring to 2025.\nAt the same time, the social networking company also projected second-quarter sales of $36.5 billion to $39 billion, with the midrange of that forecast less than analysts\u2019 average estimate.\nThose metrics overshadowed what was otherwise a solid first quarter, with revenue of $36.5 billion, an increase of more than 27% over the same period a year ago. Profit that more than doubled to $12.4 billion.\n\u201cFor all Meta\u2019s bold AI plans, it can\u2019t afford to take its eye off the nucleus of the business \u2014 its core advertising activities,\u201d Sophie Lund-Yates, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note on Wednesday. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean ignoring AI, but it does mean that spending needs to be targeted and in line with a clear strategic view.\u201d\nIn the previous quarter, Meta announced a $50 billion stock buyback, in addition to the company\u2019s first-ever quarterly dividend. It was an effort to placate investors frustrated by the company\u2019s aggressive spending on technologies that have yet to fully pay off.\nIn recent months, Zuckerberg has made AI a priority, refocusing Meta on the technology after OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot in 2022, sparking a frenzy of competition and development among the big tech companies. Meta has started inserting AI into every facet of the business, from Instagram and Facebook to its smart glasses.\nThe company announced plans for a new $800 million data center in January, and is also developing its own chips for artificial intelligence services. Meta is also working on several new iterations of its large language model, known as Llama, for powering chatbots and other AI services.\nRead More: How AI Replaced the Metaverse as Zuckerberg\u2019s Top Priority\nThe company reiterated its broader 2024 spending plans, saying it will shell out $96 billion to $99 billion for the calendar year, up slightly from a low-end target of $94 billion to $99 billion. It previously said that much of that would go toward infrastructure costs in addition to long-term bets on augmented and virtual reality.\nMeta\u2019s mixed report comes on the same day that President Joe Biden signed a bill into law that would force TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance Ltd., to sell the popular video service or face a ban in the US. The potential elimination of a major competitor could give a boost to Meta\u2019s advertising business since its short-video offering Reels is a clone of TikTok.\nReels now makes up about 50% of the time that people spend on Instagram, Li said on a call with analysts. When asked specifically about the TikTok legislation, she said it was too soon for the company to understand the potential impact.\nMeta has had a turbulent past few years, with a Covid-era bump in users and activity on the platform during lockdowns followed by a subsequent pullback in advertising in 2022. Meta also gorged on hiring when times were good, leading to some 10,000 job cuts in 2023, a period Zuckerberg dubbed the \u201cyear of efficiency.\u201d\nThose painful moves paved the way for the significant increase in profit the company is seeing now. First-quarter revenue was the highest ever in that period. More people are also returning to Meta\u2019s products.\nZuckerberg said the Threads app, similar to the former Twitter and launched last July, now has more than 150 million monthly active users \u2014 including Taylor Swift.\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke and Subrat Patnaik.\n(Updates with share trading in second paragraph.

Last year, the social media giant released its own version of an AI model to compete with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. It also added new generative AI features to its social apps, including customized stickers and celebrity-faced chatbot characters.\nIn October, the company said it would spend as much as $35 billion on infrastructure to support AI, including data centers and hardware. \u201cAI will be our biggest investment area in 2024,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg told investors that month.\nA significant amount of that spending will likely still flow to Nvidia, which builds the popular H100 graphics cards that power AI models.

So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\nIt was great to see Meta deliver solid revenue, operating profit, and EPS growth this quarter, which beat analysts' estimates. That was driven by more daily active users than expected and 6% year-on-year growth in average ad prices. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed analysts' expectations and it took up its forecasted operating expenses and capital expenditures for the full year. The increased costs are related to the company's AI infrastructure.\nDuring the quarter, Meta released its AI assistant, Meta AI. This product was rolled out across its family of apps and is powered by Llama 3, an open-source large language model that is a ChatGPT competitor. The product is quite exciting and we recommend readers to try it out.\nOverall, this quarter's print was solid but the weaker expected revenue for next quarter and higher expenses for the full year are spooking investors. The company is down 9.4% on the results and currently trades at $447.52 per share.\nMeta may have had a tough quarter, but does that actually create an opportunity to invest right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n"

        "Title": "Here's What Was Wrong With Meta's Q1 Earnings Report",
        "Author": "  Daniel Sparks, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) were hammered during after-hours trading on Wednesday, sliding more than 16% at one point. The big pullback in the stock price came after the company released its first-quarter earnings report.\nInterestingly, the social media specialist's report actually included some pretty upbeat data about Q1 itself. Revenue and earnings per share (EPS), for instance, were both ahead of analysts' average forecasts for the two metrics. So why did the stock fall?\nProbably because of Meta's guidance. Not only did it say it's now expecting to spend more on capital expenditures during 2024 than it previously anticipated, but its second-quarter revenue guidance implies a significant deceleration in its year-over-year growth rate.\nMeta's first-quarter financial performance was quite impressive. Total revenue rose 27% year over year to $36.5 billion, beating analysts' consensus forecast for about $36.2 billion.\nThis top-line performance put the figure at the high end of management's guidance for the period for revenue between $34.5 and $37 billion. Further, this marked an acceleration from the 25% year-over-year revenue growth Meta reported in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nSuch strong sales growth, combined with benefits from the company's increasing focus on efficiency, unsurprisingly led to significant operating margin expansion and, ultimately, a more than doubling in earnings per share. Meta's operating margin expanded from 25% in the year-ago quarter to 38%, while earnings per share rose 114% to $4.71.\nThis performance was fueled by healthy user metrics, including a 7% year-over-year increase in daily users across its platforms, a 20% jump in ad impressions, and a 6% boost in average price per ad.\nThese strong results put cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the period at about $58 billion, even as Meta spent approximately $14.6 billion buying back its stock and paid out $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders.\nConsidering Meta's incredible first-quarter results, the company's guidance for a slowdown is a bit surprising. Management's outlook for second-quarter revenue of between $36.5 billion and $39 billion implies 18% year-over-year growth -- a dramatic deceleration from the 27% growth the company reported in Q1.\nSuch a significant expected pullback in its top-line year-over-year growth rate may cause some investors to worry. They might be asking: Could growth slow even more in the coming quarters?\nThis is particularly concerning in a high-interest-rate environment like the ones consumers are in today. Investors are looking for clues as to whether or not this will negatively impact consumers to the point that advertisers start being more judicious about their marketing budgets.\nAnother reason Meta investors may be disappointed is the company increased its outlook for capital expenditures for the full year. Management said it now expects to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from a previous forecast for $30 billion to $37 billion. This increase is due to a continued acceleration of Meta's infrastructure investments to support its artificial intelligence (AI) product development, said Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li in the company's first-quarter earnings report.\nSlowing growth combined with higher-than-expected capital expenditures are definitely good reasons for investors to be incrementally cautious.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Meta (META) reported its first quarter earnings on Wednesday, and while it beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines, a disappointing Q2 forecast sent shares of the social media giant plummeting as much as 14% in early trading Thursday.\nMeta says it will see second quarter revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, falling short of midpoint estimates of $38.24 billion.\nIn addition to the downbeat Q2 forecast, Meta CFO Susan Li raised the company's full-year total expenses estimate from a range between $94 billion and $99 billion to between $96 billion and $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.\nOn the company's earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, \"As we're scaling capex and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently. But realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products.\"\nLi said Meta also continues to expect its Reality Labs division to report increased year-over-year operating losses as the company builds out its various AI, AR, and VR efforts.\n\"While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts,\" Li said in a release.\nMeta reported earnings per share of $4.71\u00a0in the quarter on revenue of $36.46 billion. Wall Street was anticipating EPS of $4.30 on revenue of $36.12 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\nMeta stock had been on a tear, climbing 131% over the last 12 months and more than\u00a039% year to date. That\u2019s far better than chief rival Google (GOOG, GOOGL) which is up 50%\u00a0in the last 12 months and 13%\u00a0year to date.\nWhile part of Meta\u2019s stock performance has to do with a recovery in the digital advertising market, the company\u2019s stock price also rocketed higher last quarter after the social media company announced it was initiating a $0.50 per share dividend and increased its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion.\nThe company did not announce any updates to its shareholder return initiatives on Wednesday.\nMeta has made a series of announcements regarding its AI efforts in recent months, including debuting its Meta AI chatbot and Llama 3 large language model on April 18.\nThe chatbot, however, has already garnered controversy after it joined a private Facebook group for mothers in Manhattan and claimed to have a child of its own, 404 Media reported.\nOn the metaverse front, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced on Monday that Meta will make its Horizon operating system for headsets open source, allowing third-party companies like Lenovo and Microsoft to use it to build their own devices using the software. The idea is to bring more headsets to market while increasing Meta's reach in the AR/VR space.\nThe company also stands to benefit significantly if Congress's TikTok ban, which President Biden signed into law on Wednesday, survives legal challenges. If the app is locked out of the US, it stands to reason that users and creators would turn to rival platforms like Instagram to scratch their social media itches.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "Facebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is no stranger to strong advertising growth and that is helping fuel its outstanding returns, especially lately.\nBut even after explosive gains over the last year, analysts at Wells Fargo like the company's prospects enough to maintain an overweight (buy) rating on the shares. The firm slightly trimmed its price target from $609 to $600, but the new 12-month target still shows an upside of 15% over the current share price of $520.\nWells' analysts cited internal research into Meta's advertising performance that points to strong growth in the near term. The analysts expect the company to report strong results for the first quarter and issue solid guidance for Q2.\nIn the fourth quarter, Meta's revenue grew 25% year over year, driven by a 21% increase in ad impressions and a 2% increase in price per ad across its family of apps.\nA key theme for the social media leader this year is investing in artificial intelligence (AI) tools to improve its ad systems and products. In Q4, Meta rolled out tools to build ads with text and images using generative AI, and it planned to make these tools more broadly available toward the end of the first quarter.\nMeta is loaded with cash to invest for growth. Free cash flow more than doubled in 2023 to $43 billion. Growing profitability and opportunities to drive strong advertising growth from AI explain the stock's run over the last year, and why it may continue to hit new highs.\nDespite the stock's climb, it still trades at a reasonable valuation, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg is taking a page out of Google\u2019s Android playbook by announcing on Monday that his company will make its Meta Horizon operating system for AR/VR headsets open source. The move means that third-party firms will now be able to use Meta Horizon as the software backbone for their own headsets.\nZuckerberg announced the move via Instagram, saying that the next age of computing should be powered by an open software model.\n\u201cOur goal is to make it so that the open model defines the next generation of computing again with the metaverse, glasses and headsets,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cSo that\u2019s why we're releasing our operating system so that more companies can build different things on it.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s (GOOG, GOOGL) Android operating system is considered an open software model because it allows users to install third-party apps, albeit through a convoluted and annoying process. Windows PCs and Apple\u2019s (AAPL) Macs also offer open software models, letting you download and install any apps you\u2019d like.\nApple\u2019s iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Vision Pro, however, are closed, meaning you can only install software from Apple\u2019s App Store. It\u2019s worth noting that Zuckerberg has a long-running distaste for Apple and its closed software model. The CEO has repeatedly criticized the company for not allowing certain app features on the iPhone and introducing privacy options that cut off Meta\u2019s ability to capture user data.\nZuckerberg said Meta is already working with ASUS, Lenovo, and Microsoft (MSFT) on plans for future headsets, with more companies to follow. Though, he also pointed out that it will likely take a few years for the headsets to hit the market.\nThe plan, so far, seems to be for Meta\u2019s partners to develop headsets for specific use cases. Meta currently offers its Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest Pro, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\nIn his Instagram post, Zuckerberg pointed to an example of a lightweight headset that pairs to a computer on your desk dedicated to productivity work, while another could focus on watching movies and videos and be outfitted with high-resolution OLED displays.\nHe also touched on ideas for fitness-focused headsets built with lightweight, sweat-wicking materials, as well as an Xbox-style headset that connects to Microsoft\u2019s Game Pass service and a controller to let gamers play anywhere they want.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen a company try to build out an AR/VR ecosystem with third-party manufacturing partners. Microsoft also attempted to get its now-defunct Windows Mixed Reality platform off the ground with manufacturing partners like ASUS, Dell, Lenovo, and Samsung building headsets powered by the software.\nThe headsets never caught on, though, and Microsoft is now set to remove the platform entirely from the next big Windows 11 update.\nThe AR/VR headset market is still a relatively niche technology segment, even among teens. According to Piper Sandler\u2019s most recent Taking Stock with Teens survey, 33% of teens surveyed own a VR device, but only 4% use it on a daily basis. Another 13% said they use their headsets weekly, while a whopping 56% said they seldom use them. What\u2019s more, 32% of teens said they aren\u2019t interested in and have no plans to buy headsets.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The firm stands to benefit from digital advertising spending in a world of smartphone addicts. The owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp grew its daily active users by 8% in Q4 to 3.19 billion, with monthly users up 6% to 3.98 billion.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nOn top of reaching half of the globe, Meta is investing in its AI future, recently introducing its own new generation of AI chips to compete alongside the likes of Nvidia (NVDA) and others. Plus, Meta could benefit from an entirely new lane of growth if its metaverse dreams becomes a reality down the road.\u00a0\nOther Fundamentals \nMeta is a digital advertising titan, dwarfing its competitors such as Snap and Pinterest. Meta\u2019s revenue is projected to jump 18% in FY24 and 13% next year to $180 billion (up from $135 billion in 2023).\nMeta is projected to grow its adjusted EPS by 35% in FY24 and 16% in FY25, following 73% earnings expansion in 2023. Its Zacks consensus estimates for FY24 and FY25 earnings have surged 38% over the past 12 months and Meta crushed our estimates in the trailing four quarters.\nThe tech giant\u2019s balance sheet is stellar, helping it pursue new growth areas such as AI. Meta confirmed its commitment to shareholders earlier this year when it initiated a quarterly dividend. Wall Street is very high on the stock, with 40 of the 46 brokerage recommendations that Zacks has at \u201cStrong Buys.\u201d\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta stock has soared 125% in the last year and 450% off its 2022 lows, including a 40% YTD surge. The stock has pulled back off its early April records, slipping below its 50-day moving average recently for the first time this year alongside the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Meta might face selling pressure down to its 200-day or 21-week moving averages. But it has already cooled off from heavily overbought RSI levels to below neutral.\nDespite its rebound and its 735% climb in the last 10 years to easily double Tech, its valuation is impressive. Meta trades at an 8% discount to the Zacks tech sector and 60% below its highs at 23.8X forward 12-month earnings.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nMeta\u2019s positive EPS revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Meta\u2019s recent cooldown alongside the market makes the stock a potentially more appealing long-term buy-and-hold candidate for investors who can weather potential near-term volatility.\nOthers might want to wait until after Meta reports or a larger pullback, though the market-timing game is notoriously difficult.\u00a0\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Meta Platforms (META) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The market expects Meta Platforms (META) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2024. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 24, 2024, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\nZacks Consensus Estimate\nThis social media company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $4.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +63.3%.\nRevenues are expected to be $36.22 billion, up 26.4% from the year-ago quarter.\nEstimate Revisions Trend\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.5% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\nInvestors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.\nEarnings Whisper\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Meta Platforms?\nFor Meta Platforms, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.26%.\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.\nSo, this combination indicates that Meta Platforms will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Meta Platforms would post earnings of $4.83 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.33, delivering a surprise of +10.35%.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.\nBottom Line\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\nMeta Platforms appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Meta and Google announce new in-house AI chips, creating a \u2018trillion-dollar question\u2019 for Nvidia",
        "Author": "  Dylan Sloan ",
        "Text": "Meta just announced it\u2019s pushing further into the AI chip race, coming right on the heels of Google\u2019s own announcement of its Axion AI chip. Both companies are touting their new semiconductor models as key to the development of their AI platforms, and as alternatives to the Nvidia chips they\u2014and the rest of the tech industry\u2014have been relying on to power AI data centers.\nHardware is emerging as a key AI growth area. For Big Tech companies with the money and talent to do so, developing in-house chips helps reduce dependence on outside designers such as Nvidia and Intel while also allowing firms to tailor their hardware specifically to their own AI models, boosting performance and saving on energy costs.\nThese in-house AI chips that Google and Meta just announced pose one of the first real challenges to Nvidia\u2019s dominant position in the AI hardware market. Nvidia controls more than 90% of the AI chips market, and demand for its industry-leading semiconductors is only increasing. But if Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers start making their own chips instead, its soaring share price, up 87% since the start of the year, could suffer.\n\u201cFrom Meta\u2019s point of view \u2026 it gives them a bargaining tool with Nvidia,\u201d Edward Wilford, an analyst at tech consultancy Omdia, told Fortune. \u201cIt lets Nvidia know that they\u2019re not exclusive, [and] that they have other options. It\u2019s hardware optimized for the AI that they are developing.\u201d\nWhy does AI need new chips?\u00a0\nAI models require massive amounts of computing power because of the huge amount of data required to train the large language models behind them. Conventional computer chips simply aren\u2019t capable of processing the trillions of data points AI models are built upon, which has spawned a market for AI-specific computer chips, often called \u201ccutting-edge\u201d chips because they\u2019re the most powerful devices on the market.\nSemiconductor giant Nvidia has dominated this nascent market: The wait list for Nvidia\u2019s $30,000 flagship AI chip is months long, and demand has pushed the firm\u2019s share price up almost 90% in the past six months.\nAnd rival chipmaker Intel is fighting to stay competitive. It just released its Gaudi 3 AI chip to compete directly with Nvidia. AI developers\u2014from Google and Microsoft down to small startups\u2014are all competing for scarce AI chips, limited by manufacturing capacity.\nWhy are tech companies starting to make their own chips?\nBoth Nvidia and Intel can produce only a limited number of chips because they and the rest of the industry rely on Taiwanese manufacturer TSMC to actually assemble their chip designs. With only one manufacturer solidly in the game, the manufacturing lead time for these cutting-edge chips is multiple months. That\u2019s a key factor that led major players in the AI space, such as Google and Meta, to resort to designing their own chips. Alvin Nguyen, a senior analyst at consulting firm Forrester, told Fortune that chips designed by the likes of Google, Meta, and Amazon won\u2019t be as powerful as Nvidia\u2019s top-of-the-line offerings\u2014but that could benefit the companies in terms of speed. They\u2019ll be able to produce them on less specialized assembly lines with shorter wait times, he said.\n\u201cIf you have something that\u2019s 10% less powerful but you can get it now, I\u2019m buying that every day,\u201d Nguyen said.\nEven if the native AI chips Meta and Google are developing are less powerful than Nvidia\u2019s cutting-edge AI chips, they could be better tailored to the company\u2019s specific AI platforms. Nguyen said that in-house chips designed for a company\u2019s own AI platform could be more efficient and save on costs by eliminating unnecessary functions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like buying a car. Okay, you need an automatic transmission. But do you need the leather seats, or the heated massage seats?\u201d Nguyen said.\n\u201cThe benefit for us is that we can build a chip that can handle our specific workloads more efficiently,\u201d Melanie Roe, a Meta spokesperson, wrote in an email to Fortune.\nNvidia\u2019s top-of-the-line chips sell for about $25,000 apiece. They\u2019re extremely powerful tools, and they\u2019re designed to be good at a wide range of applications, from training AI chatbots to generating images to developing recommendation algorithms such as the ones on TikTok and Instagram. That means a slightly less powerful, but more tailored chip could be a better fit for a company such as Meta, for example\u2014which has invested in AI primarily for its recommendation algorithms, not consumer-facing chatbots.\n\u201cThe Nvidia GPUs are excellent in AI data centers, but they are general purpose,\u201d Brian Colello, equity research lead at Morningstar, told Fortune. \u201cThere are likely certain workloads and certain models where a custom chip might be even better.\u201d\nThe trillion-dollar question\nNguyen said that more specialized in-house chips could have added benefits by virtue of their ability to integrate into existing data centers. Nvidia chips consume a lot of power, and they give off a lot of heat and noise\u2014so much so that tech companies may be forced to redesign or move their data centers to integrate soundproofing and liquid cooling. Less powerful native chips, which consume less energy and release less heat, could solve that problem.\nAI chips developed by Meta and Google are long-term bets. Nguyen estimated that these chips took roughly a year and a half to develop, and it\u2019ll likely be months before they\u2019re implemented at a large scale. For the foreseeable future, the entire AI world will continue to depend heavily on Nvidia (and, to a lesser extent, Intel) for its computing hardware needs. Indeed, Mark Zuckerberg recently announced that Meta was on track to own 350,000 Nvidia chips by the end of this year (the company\u2019s set to spend around $18 billion on chips by then). But movement away from outsourcing computing power and toward native chip design could loosen Nvidia\u2019s chokehold on the market.\n\u201cThe trillion-dollar question for Nvidia\u2019s valuation is the threat of these in-house chips,\u201d Colello said. \u201cIf these in-house chips significantly reduce the reliance on Nvidia, there\u2019s probably downside to Nvidia\u2019s stock from here. This development is not surprising, but the execution of it over the next few years is the key valuation question in our mind.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Meta Platforms Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Meta Platforms (META) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to META for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nMeta Platforms' Business In-Depth\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Meta Platforms' main business drivers.\nMeta Platforms is the world\u2019s largest social media platform. The company\u2019s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta\u2019s family of products used by almost 3.98 billion people on a monthly basis as of Dec 31, 2023.Newly introduced metric, which is the family daily active people (DAP) that measures daily users of its family of products, was 3.19 billion, as of Dec 31. \u00a0Meta uses metrics like daily active users (DAUs) and monthly active users (MAUs) to measure Facebook\u2019s user base. As of Dec 31, 2023, DAUs and MAUs were 2.11 billion and 3.065 billion, respectively.Headquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Meta generated revenues worth $134.9 billion in 2023. Advertisement accounted for 97.8% of revenues. Marketers buy ads that can appear on multiple platforms including Meta, Instagram, Messenger and third-party applications and websites.Meta, thanks to its huge user base gained a significant market share in the advertising space wherein it faces tough competition from Google, Twitter, Amazon and Snapchat-parent Snap.Meta also faces significant competition from the likes of Apple (messaging), YouTube (advertising and video), Bytedance (social media) and Tencent (messaging and social media).Meta core app enables people to connect, share, discover and communicate with one other on mobile devices and personal computers. User engagement on core Meta platform is fostered by News Feed that displays an algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements customized for each user.Instagram is a community for sharing photos, videos and messages, enabling people to discover interests that they care about. People can express themselves through photos, videos and private messaging via Instagram Feed and Stories.Messenger helps people to connect with friends, family, groups and businesses across platforms and devices. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable and secure messaging application, used by people and businesses around the world to communicate in a private way.Meta also offers virtual reality (VR) products through its Oculus division.\nBottom Line\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Meta Platforms ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in April 2014 would be worth $8,938.32, or a gain of 793.83%, as of April 12, 2024, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.\nThe S&P 500 rose 186.34% and the price of gold increased 73.17% over the same time frame in comparison.\nAnalysts are forecasting more upside for META too.\nMeta is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. The company is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta\u2019s advertising revenues. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns.\nShares have gained 6.37% over the past four weeks and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "Title": "Meta shares sink on higher AI spending, light revenue forecast",
        "Author": "  Katie Paul and Yuvraj Malik ",
        "Text": "By Katie Paul and Yuvraj Malik\n(Reuters) -Meta Platforms disappointed investors on Wednesday with forecasts of higher expenses and lighter-than-expected revenue, knocking nearly $200 billion off its stock market value and raising fears the surging cost of AI is outpacing its benefits.\nShares of the Facebook and Instagram parent dropped about 15% in extended trade following the report, its market capitalization plunging to about $1 trillion.\nThe late-day slump in Meta's stock value was just short of the $232 billion one-day loss suffered on Feb. 3, 2022, which was the record one-day loss of market capitalization for any U.S. company.\nAlphabet shares fell 3% in extended trade and Microsoft declined 2%, with concerns that Wall Street may have underestimated the cost of the AI race hitting those Big Tech companies ahead of their reports on Thursday.\nNvidia lost 1.4% and Amazon dropped 2.6%.\nMeta said it expects April-June revenue in the range of $36.5 billion-$39 billion, with a midpoint of $37.8 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $38.3 billion, according to LSEG data.\nThe company raised its forecast for expenses this year to support investments in new AI products and the computing infrastructure needed to support them, adding that it expected spending would continue to increase next year.\nIt raised its 2024 total expense forecast to $96 billion-$99 billion, from $94 billion-$99 billion. It also expects 2024 capital expenditure to fall within a range of $30 billion-$40 billion, up from its earlier forecast of $35 billion-$37 billion, it said.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on a conference call that the focus on AI would \"grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products.\"\nZuckerberg's comments and the quarterly results tempered expectations for Meta's AI investments after a series of smash-hit quarters for the social media giant. Meta enjoyed the biggest one-day gain in market capitalization in Wall Street history after its last quarterly report, when it posted robust results and announced a first-ever dividend.\n\"Investors are skeptical of the growing AI spending. Some of those investments could take years to pay off,\" said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence.\n\"But Meta is in the AI race to win it, and Meta AI could be a dark horse. It has a built-in audience through its existing apps, and it will have an advantage in eventual monetization through its ad ecosystem,\" Enberg said.\nThe company has been updating its ad-buying products with AI tools and short video formats to boost revenue growth, while also introducing new AI features like a chat assistant to drive engagement on its social media properties.\nIt announced last week that it is giving its Meta AI assistant more prominent billing across its suite of apps, meaning it will start to see how popular the product is with users in the second quarter.\n\"For all Meta's bold AI plans, it can't afford to take its eye off the nucleus of the business - its core advertising activities,\" said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe company's metaverse-oriented Reality Labs division missed expectations for the first quarter, posting sales of $440 million. Investors had been expecting $475 million, according to LSEG data.\nThe unit's sales leaped 30% from the year prior, but were still below the average revenue of $523 million posted in previous first-quarter reports since Meta started disclosing Reality Labs revenue in 2021.\nReality Labs lost $3.8 billion in the quarter, putting it on track this year to match the $16 billion it lost over the course of 2023.\nZuckerberg also described potential monetization plans for Meta's AI chatbot, such as using it for business messaging and customer support.\nMeta theoretically stands to benefit from regulatory pressures bearing down on its Chinese-owned short video competitor TikTok, which is facing the threat of a U.S. ban, although Meta CFO Susan Li told investors she was not yet ready to assess the business impact of the potential setback for its rival.\nMeta posted first-quarter revenue of $36.5 billion, roughly in line with expectations of $36.2 billion, according to LSEG data.\nMeta's daily active people (DAP), a metric it uses to track unique users of any one of its apps Facebook, Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp in a day, grew 7%.\nDAP grew 8% in the preceding quarter.\nMeta disclosed only the DAP figure for user growth, a first for the company. It said earlier this year that it would no longer break out numbers for flagship social network Facebook, whose growth has slowed in recent years.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and Katie Paul in New YorkAdditional reporting by Noel Randewich in Oakland, California, and Sheila Dang in DallasEditing by Sriraj Kalluvila, Kenneth Li, Matthew Lewis and Tom Hogue)\n"

        "Author": "  BARBARA ORTUTAY ",
        "Text": "Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta said Wednesday its first-quarter profit more than doubled, boosted by higher advertising revenue and a 6% increase on the average price of ads on its platforms. But its shares dropped sharply in after-hours trading following lukewarm revenue guidance.\nMeta Platforms Inc. earned $12.37 billion, or $4.71 per share, in the January-March period. That's up from $5.71 billion, or $2.20 per share, in the same period a year earlier.\nRevenue rose 27% to $36.46 billion from $28.65 billion.\nAnalysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $4.32 per share on revenue of $36.14 billion, according to a poll by FactSet.\nFor the current quarter, the Menlo Park, California-based company said it expects revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. Analysts are expecting revenue of $38.25 billion for the second quarter, which is higher than the midpoint of Meta's guidance range.\nMeta also said it expects its 2024 capital expenses to be higher than anticipated due to its investments in artificial intelligence. It is forecasting expenses in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, up from its earlier guidance of $30 billion to $37 billion.\nThe company has been investing heavily in AI and earlier this month unveiled a new set of artificial intelligence systems that are powering what CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls \u201cthe most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\u201d\nMeta, along with leading AI developers Google and OpenAI, and startups such as Anthropic, Cohere and France\u2019s Mistral, have been churning out new AI language models and hoping to persuade customers they\u2019ve got the smartest, handiest or most efficient chatbots.\n\u201cMeta\u2019s earnings should serve as a stark warning for companies reporting this earnings season,\" said Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com \u201cEven though the company did beat estimates in all top- and bottom-line metrics, it didn\u2019t matter as much as the reported lowering revenue expectations for Q2. This is the exact opposite of what Tesla did yesterday and goes to show that investors are currently looking at the near future with heavy mistrust.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, electric vehicle maker Tesla reported that its first-quarter net income plummeted 55%. But it said it would accelerate production of new, more affordable vehicles, and on Wednesday its stock rose 12%.\nThe number of people using Meta's apps, meanwhile, continued to increase, with 3.24 billion users on average for March in its \u201cfamily of apps\u201d that includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. That's up 7% year-over-year. Beginning this quarter, the company will no longer disclose user figures for Facebook.\nMeta had 69,329 workers as of March 31, a decrease of 10% year-over-year. Zuckerberg called 2023 the \u201cyear of efficiency\" and the company laid off thousands to reduce expenses.\nMeta's shares fell 16% in after-hours trading. Meta's stock price has more than doubled over the past year thanks to a rebound in online advertising.\n"

        "Title": "We Think Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Can Manage Its Debt With Ease",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.\n See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nThe image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2023 Meta Platforms had debt of US$18.4b, up from US$9.92b in one year. But it also has US$65.4b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$47.0b net cash.\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Meta Platforms had liabilities of US$32.0b due within a year, and liabilities of US$44.5b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$65.4b and US$16.2b worth of receivables due within a year. So it actually has US$5.12b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\nHaving regard to Meta Platforms' size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$1.24t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Simply put, the fact that Meta Platforms has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.\nIn addition to that, we're happy to report that Meta Platforms has boosted its EBIT by 50%, thus reducing the spectre of future debt repayments. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Meta Platforms's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. Meta Platforms may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, Meta Platforms produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 78% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Meta Platforms has US$47.0b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with its EBIT growth of 50% over the last year. So we don't think Meta Platforms's use of debt is risky. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms that you should be aware of before investing here.\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Reported EPS is $4.71, expectations were $4.32.\nOperator: Good afternoon. My name is Krista and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Meta First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call will be recorded. Thank you very much. Ken Dorell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.\nKenneth Dorell: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Meta Platform's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; and Susan Li, CFO. Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's earnings press release and in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\nMark Zuckerberg: All right. Thanks, Ken, and everyone, thanks for joining. It's been a good start to the year both in terms of product momentum and business performance. We estimate that more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of our apps each day and we're seeing healthy growth in the US. And I want to call out WhatsApp specifically where the number of daily actives and message sends in the US keeps gaining momentum and I think we're on a good path there. We've also made good progress on our AI and Metaverse efforts and that's where I'm going to focus most of my comments today. So let's start with AI. We are building a number of different AI services from Meta AI, our AI assistant that you can ask any question across our apps and glasses, to creator AIs that help creators engage their communities and that fans can interact with, to business AIs that we think every business eventually on our platform will use to help customers buy things and get customer support, to internal coding and development AIs, to hardware like glasses for people to interact with AIs and a lot more.\nLast week, we had the major release of our new version of Meta AI that is now powered by our latest model, Llama 3 and our goal with Meta AI is to build the world's leading AI service, both in quality and usage. The initial rollout of Meta AI is going well. Tens of millions of people have already tried it. The feedback is very positive and when I first checked in with our teams, the majority of feedback we were getting was people asking us to release Meta AI for them wherever they are. So we've started launching Meta AI in some English speaking countries and we'll roll out in more languages and countries over the coming months. You all know our product development playbook by this point. We release an early version of a product to a limited audience to gather feedback and start improving it.\nAnd then once we think it's ready, then we make it available to more people. That early release was last fall and with this release, we are now moving to that next growth phase of our playbook. We believe that Meta AI with Llama 3 is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use and now that we have the superior quality product, we are making it easier for lots of people to use it within WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and Facebook. Now in addition to answering more complex queries, a few other notable and unique features from this release. Meta AI now creates animations from still images and now generates high quality images so fast that it can create and update them as you are typing, which is pretty awesome. I've seen a lot of people commenting about that experience online and how they've never seen or experienced anything like it before.\nIn terms of the core AI model and intelligence that's powering Meta AI, I'm very pleased with how Llama 3 has come together so far. The 8 billion and 70 billion parameter models that we released are best-in-class for their scale. The 400 plus billion parameter model that we're still training seems on track to be industry leading on several benchmarks and I expect their models are just going to improve further from open source contributions. Overall, I view the results our teams have achieved here as another key milestone in showing that we have the talent, data and ability to scale infrastructure to build the world's leading AI models and services and this leads me to believe that we should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world.\nAs we're scaling CapEx and energy expenses for AI, we'll continue focusing on operating the rest of our company efficiently, but realistically, even with shifting many of our existing resources to focus on AI, we'll still grow our investment envelope meaningfully before we make much revenue from some of these new products. I think it's worth calling that out that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product, but aren't yet monetizing it. We saw this with reels, stories as newsfeed transitioned to mobile and more and I also expect to see a multi-year investment cycle before we fully scaled Meta AI, business AIs and more into the profitable services I expect as well.\nHistorically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long-term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us and the initial signs are quite positive here too. But building the leading AI will also be a larger undertaking than the other experiences we've added to our apps and this is likely going to take several years. On the upside, once our new AI services reach scale, we have a strong track record of monetizing them effectively. There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute. And on top of those. AI is already helping us improve app engagement, which naturally leads to seeing more ads and improving ads directly to deliver more value.\nSo if the technology and products evolve in the way that we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and business for us over time. We are seeing good progress on some of these efforts already. Right now, about 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by our AI recommendation system. That's up 2x over the last couple of years and for the first time ever, more than 50% of the content that people see on Instagram is now AI recommended. AI has also been a huge part of how we create value for advertisers by showing people more relevant ads. And if you look at our two end-to-end AI powered tools, Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app campaigns, revenue flowing through those has more than doubled since last year.\nWe're also going to continue to be very focused on efficiency as we scale Meta AI and other AI services. Some of this will come from improving how we train and run models. Some improvements will come from the open source community and we're improving cost efficiency as one of the main areas that I expect that open sourcing will help us improve, similar to what we saw with open compute. We'll also keep making progress on building more of our own silicon. Our Meta training and inference accelerator chip has successfully enabled us to run some of our recommendations related workloads on this less expensive stack. And as this program matures over the coming years, we plan to expand this to more of our workloads as well. And of course, as we ramp these investments, we will also continue to carefully manage headcount and other expense growth throughout the company.\nNow in addition to our work on AI, our other long-term focus is the Metaverse. It's been interesting to see how these two themes have come together. This is clearest when you look at glasses. I used to think that AR glasses wouldn't really be a mainstream product until we had full holographic displays. And I still think that that's going to be awesome and is the long-term mature state for the product, but now it seems pretty clear that there's also a meaningful market for fashionable AI glasses without a display. Glasses are the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you hear, so they have full context on what's going on around you as they help you with whatever you're trying to do. Our launch this week of Meta AI with vision on the glasses is a good example where you can now ask questions about things that you're looking at.\nNow one strategy dynamic that I've been reflecting on is that an increasing amount of our Reality Labs work is going towards serving our AI efforts. We currently report on our financials as a Family of Apps and Reality Labs were two completely separate businesses, but strategically I think of them as fundamentally the same business with the vision of Reality Labs to build the next generation of computing platforms in large parts that way we can build the best apps and experiences on top of them. Over time, we'll need to find better ways to articulate the value that's generated here across both segments, so it doesn't just seem like our hardware costs increase as our glasses ecosystem scales, but all the value flows to a different segment. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses that we built with EssilorLuxottica continue to do well and are sold out in many styles and colors.\nSo we're working to make more and release additional styles as quickly as we can. We just released the new cat-eye Skyler design yesterday, which is more feminine and in general, I'm optimistic about our approach of starting with the classics and expanding with an increasing diversity of options over time. If we want everyone to be able to use wearable AI, I think eyewear is a bit different from phones or watches and that people are going to want very different designs. So I think our approach of partnering with the leading eyewear brands will help us serve more of the market. I think a similar open ecosystem approach will help us expand the virtual and mixed reality headset market over time as well. We announced that we're opening up Meta Horizon OS, the operating system we've built to power Quest.\nAs the ecosystem grows, I think there will be sufficient diversity in how people use mixed reality that there will be demand for more designs than we'll be able to build, for example, a work focused headset, maybe slightly less designed for motion, but may want to be lighter by connecting to your laptop, a fitness focused headset may be lighter with sweat wicking materials. An entertainment focused headset may prioritize the highest resolution displays over everything else. A gaming focused headset may prioritize peripherals and haptics or a device that comes with Xbox controllers and a game pass subscription out of the box. Now to be clear, I think that our first party Quest devices will continue to be the most popular headsets as we see today and we'll continue focusing on advancing the state-of-the-art tech and making it accessible to everyone, but I also think that opening our ecosystem and opening our operating system will help the overall mixed reality ecosystem grow even faster.\nNow in addition to AI and the Metaverse, we're seeing good improvements across our apps. I touched on some of the most important trends already with WhatsApp growth in the US and AI powered recommendations in our feeds and reels already, but I do want to mention that video continues to be a bright spot. This month, we launched an updated full screen video player on Facebook that brings together reels, longer videos and live content into a single experience with a unified recommendation system. On Instagram, reels and video continue to drive engagement with reels alone now making up 50% of the time that's spent within the app. Threads is growing well too. They're now more than 150 million monthly actives and it continues to generally be on the trajectory that I hope to see.\nAnd of course, my daughters would want me to mention that Taylor Swift is now on Threads. That one was a big deal in my house. All right, that is what I wanted to cover today. I am proud of the progress we've made so far this year. We've got a lot more execution ahead to fulfill the opportunities ahead of us. A big thank you to all of our teams who are driving all these advances and to all of you for being on this journey with us. And now here is Susan.\nSusan Li: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Q1 total revenue was $36.5 billion, up 27% on both a reported and constant currency basis. Q1 total expenses were $22.6 billion, up 6% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue increased 9% as higher infrastructure-related costs were partially offset by lapping reality lab's inventory-related valuation adjustments. R&D increased 6% driven mostly by higher headcount related expenses and infrastructure costs, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Marketing and sales decreased 16% due mainly to lower restructuring costs, professional services and marketing spend.\nG&A increased 20% as higher legal related expenses were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. We ended the first quarter with over 69,300 employees, up 3% from Q4. First quarter operating income was $13.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 13%. Net income was $12.4 billion or $4.71 per share. Capital expenditures including principal payments on finance leases were $6.7 billion driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $12.5 billion. We repurchased $14.6 billion of our Class A common stock and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to shareholders ending the quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt. Moving now to our segment results.\nI'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. Our community across the Family of Apps continues to grow with approximately 3.2 billion people using at least one of our Family of Apps on a daily basis in March. Q1 total Family of Apps revenue was $36 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Q1 Family of Apps ad revenue was $35.6 billion, up 27% or 26% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth followed by gaming and entertainment and media. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Rest of World and Europe at 40% and 33%, respectively. Asia-Pacific grew 25% and North America grew 22%. In Q1, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 20% and the average price per ad increased 6%.\nImpression growth was mainly driven by Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. Pricing growth was driven by advertiser demand, which was partially offset by strong impression growth, particularly from lower monetizing regions and surfaces. Family of Apps other revenue was $380 million in Q1, up 85% driven by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q1, Family of Apps expenses were $18.4 billion, representing approximately 81% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were up 7% due mainly to higher legal and infrastructure costs that were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Family of Apps operating income was $17.7 billion, representing a 49% operating margin.\nWithin our Reality Labs segment, Q1 revenue was $440 million, up 30% driven by Quest headset sales. Reality Labs expenses were $4.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year as higher headcount related expenses were more than offset by lapping inventory related valuation adjustments and restructuring costs. Reality Labs operating loss was $3.8 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are two primary factors that drive our revenue performance, our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, we remain pleased with engagement trends and have strong momentum across our product priorities. Our investments in developing increasingly advanced recommendation systems continue to drive incremental engagement on our platforms demonstrating that people are finding added value by discovering content from accounts they're not connected to.\nThe level of recommended content in our apps has scaled as we've improved these systems and we see further opportunity to increase the relevance and personalization of recommendations as we advance our models. Video also continues to grow across our platform and it now represents more than 60% of time on both Facebook and Instagram. Reels remains the primary driver of that growth and we're progressing on our work to bring together reels longer form video and live video into one experience on Facebook. In April, we rolled out this unified video experience in the US and Canada, which is increasingly powered by our next generation ranking architecture that we expect will help deliver more relevant video recommendations over time. We're also introducing deeper integrations of Generative AI into our apps in the US and more than a dozen other countries.\nAlong with using Meta AI within our chat surfaces, people will now be able to use Meta AI in search within our apps as well as feed and groups on Facebook. We expect these integrations will complement our social discovery strategy as our recommendation systems help people to discover and explore their interests while Meta AI enables them to dive deeper on topics they're interested in. Threads also continues to see good traction as we continue to ship valuable features and scale the community. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. There are two parts to this work. The first is optimizing the level of ads within organic engagement. Here we continue to advance our understanding of users' preferences for viewing ads to more effectively optimize the right time, place and person to show an ad to.\nFor example, we are getting better at adjusting the placement and number of ads in real time based on our perception of a user's interest in ad content and to minimize disruption from ads as well as innovating on new and creative ad formats. We expect to continue that work going forward while surfaces with relatively lower levels of monetization like video and messaging will serve as additional growth opportunities. The second part of improving monetization efficiency is enhancing marketing performance. Similar to our work with organic recommendations, AI is playing an increasing role in these efforts. First, we are making ongoing ads modeling improvements that are delivering better performance for advertisers. One example is our new ads ranking architecture Meta Lattice, which we began rolling out more broadly last year.\nThis new architecture allows us to run significantly larger models that generalize learnings across objectives and surfaces in place of numerous smaller ad models that have historically been optimized for individual objectives and surfaces. This is not only leading to increased efficiency as we operate fewer models, but also improving ad performance. Another way we're leveraging AI is to provide increased automation for advertisers. Through our Advantage+ portfolio, advertisers can automate one step of the campaign setup process, such as selecting which ad creative to show or automate their campaign completely using our end-to-end automation tools, Advantage+ shopping and Advantage+ app ads. We're seeing growing use of these solutions and we expect to drive further adoption over the course of the year while applying what we learned to our broader ads investments.\nNext, I'd like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. We continue to see compelling investment opportunities to both improve our core business in the near term and capture significant longer term opportunities in Generative AI and Reality Labs. As we develop more advanced and compute intensive recommendation models and scale capacity for our Generative AI training and inference needs, we expect that having sufficient infrastructure capacity will be critical to realizing many of these opportunities. As a result, we expect that we will invest significantly more in infrastructure over the coming years. Our other long-term initiative that we're continuing to make significant investments in is Reality Labs. We are also starting to see our AI initiatives increasingly overlap with our Reality Labs work.\nFor example, with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, people in the US and Canada can now use our multimodal meta AI assistant for daily tasks without pulling out their phone. Longer term, we expect Generative AI to play an increasing role in our mixed reality products making it easier to develop immersive experiences. Accelerating our AI efforts will help ensure we can provide the best version of our services as we transition to the next computing platform. We expect to pursue these opportunities while maintaining a focus on operating discipline and we believe our strong financial position will allow us to support these investments while also returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the US that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWe also have a jury trial scheduled for June in a suit brought by the State of Texas regarding our use of facial recognition technology, which could ultimately result in a material loss. Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect second quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5 billion to $39 billon. Our guidance assumes foreign currency as a 1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Turning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96 billion to $99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94 billion to $99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nTurning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, increased from our prior range of $30 billion to $37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect CapEx will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts. On to tax. Absent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In closing, Q1 was a good start to the year. We're seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress on our longer term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services over the coming years.\nWith that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.\nSee also\n20 Countries with the Highest Consumer Spending in the World and\n12 Countries with the Largest Slum Population in Europe.\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\n"

        "Text": "Mark Zuckerberg is Meta\u2019s lowest-paid employee\u2014at least on paper. The tech entrepreneur\u2019s base salary for 2023 was a humble $1 dollar, while the median worker at the tech giant took home a staggering $379,000.\nIn comparison, the average tech worker can expect to earn between $35,000 to $120,000 depending on the role, according to Indeed.\nBut don\u2019t be fooled by Zuckerberg\u2019s humble base pay and the fact that he didn\u2019t take home a bonus last year\u2014the billionaire still cost the company millions in compensation.\nAccording to a proxy filing statement published ahead of the annual meeting of shareholders at the end of May, the Facebook founder received $24.4 million in \u2018other compensation\u2019\u2014much of which covered his security costs.\nIn 2023, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp, revealed that it had increased Zuckerberg\u2019s personal security pre-tax allowance by 40% from $10 million in 2018 to around $14 million.\nThe announcement came just after the company laid off 11,000 employees, the equivalent of 13% of its workforce, leading various publications to link the two.\nHowever, since then the company has slashed thousands of more jobs, while Zuckerberg\u2019s spending on security has actually slightly decreased.\nIn 2022, the social networking chief splashed out $14,829,245 on personal security \u201cat his residences and during personal travel,\u201d according to the proxy filing. Meanwhile, last year\u2014during Meta\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d\u2014his security bill came to a total of $9,431,139.\nThe compensation payment also includes almost $1 million \u201cfor costs related to personal usage of private aircraft.\u201d\nWhile justifying the cost, Meta explained that it has identified \u201cspecific threats\u201d to Zuckerberg as the face of the brand, including being targeted by angry customers.\n\u201cWe believe that Mr. Zuckerberg's role puts him in a unique position: he is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,\u201d the company wrote in the filing.\n\u201cMr. Zuckerberg is one of the most-recognized executives in the world, in large part as a result of the size of our user base and our continued exposure to global media, legislative, and regulatory attention.\u201d\nFortune has contacted Meta for comment.\nZuckerberg\u2019s been part of the $1 salary club\u2014which has previously included Larry Page, Larry Ellison and the late Steve Jobs\u2014 since 2013, making his salary earnings just $11 in over a decade.\nBut he\u2019s seen his personal wealth balloon. In February, his net worth soared by $28 billion in just one day thanks to Meta\u2019s better-than-expected fourth quarterly results.\nAfter a year of being in cost-cutting mode, including dismissing about 21,000 workers, the company doubled its operating margin to 41% and decreased expenses by 8% year over year. \nAs a result of Meta\u2019s turnaround success, Zuckerberg\u2014whose wealth is largely tied to his stake in the social media giant\u2014has leap\u2013frogged Elon Musk as the world's third-richest person, according to data from Bloomberg.\nAs of April 23, Zuckerberg\u2019s net worth is $176 billion\u2014up from around $78 billion this time last year.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Meta spent $4.3 billion on its VR division in three months, and made *checks figures* $440 million in return",
        "Author": "  Andy Edser ",
        "Text": "VR is sometimes dismissed as a fad, with some seemingly desperate to ring the death knell on virtual reality and its associated hardware at the earliest opportunity. While we're not so convinced, the latest financial report from Meta shows staggering expenses in regards to its VR headset and augmented reality division that are difficult to ignore.\nMeta's first quarter results of 2024 reveal that Reality Labs, the company's business and research unit that develops and produces VR headsets like the Meta Quest 3, made $440 million, a 30% increase attributed to Quest headset sales. Reality Labs' expenses, however, were an eye-watering $4.3 billion.\nThis was actually down 1% year-over-year, as \"higher headcount related expenses were more than offset by lapping inventory related valuation adjustments and restructuring costs.\"\nStill, that leaves Reality Labs with an operating loss of $3.8 billion, which is hardly the sort of small change you wouldn't mind losing down the back of the sofa.\nThose of you with a good memory will also remember that this isn't the first time Meta's Reality Labs has suffered financially, as last year it was reported that it spent $4.279 billion in the last financial quarter of 2022.\nDespite owning a VR division that seems to be bleeding money, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has recently vowed to increase spending overall at Meta to turn it into \"the leading AI company in the world\" (via The Financial Times), which seems to have spooked investors and caused a 12% loss in share value in wake of his statements.\nFinancial woes indeed then, although its not like Meta has been shown to be particularly careful with its pocketbook recently. Aside from its VR losses, the company has been investing in AI-crunching hardware like the Nvidia H100 GPU en masse in order to train its language models, and current estimates indicate that this substantial investment could add up to $7 billion worth of the immensely powerful Nvidia chips by the end of the year.\nWell, AI hardware is expensive after all, with those H100 GPUs estimated to cost between $20,000 to $40,000 per unit.\nStill, when it comes to VR, all these heavy costs might eventually start to balance out. According to a tweet from tech investor Jack Soslow, a16z Games\u2014a company that raises investment funds for games industry founders, so prepare your appropriate dose of salt\u2014the Meta Quest line has sold more than you might think.\nVirtual reality\nBest VR headset: which kit should you choose? Best graphics card: you need serious GPU power for VR Best gaming laptop: don't get tied to your desktop in VR\nAccording to his data, Meta's Quest line beat Microsoft Xbox sales by a significant amount in the past two years. If his estimated eight to 12 million sales of headsets in 2024 proves out (you did take that salt, didn't you?) then we could potentially be looking at a trend towards VR headset adoption starting to outpace console sales as a whole, although lets face it, the Xbox Series S and Series X have been out for a while now, and it's probably no surprise that sales are on the decline.\nMmm, briny. Anyway, whether this proves to be an indicator of an eventual stratospheric rise of VR headsets into the heady heights of immense profitability, remains to be seen. For now, it seems to be something of an expensive bet, although time will tell whether all this immense spending eventually pays off.\n"

        "Text": "Shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) traded sharply lower Thursday morning, falling as much as 16%. As of 10:52 a.m. ET, the stock was still down 12.3%.\nThe catalyst that sent the social media titan lower was the company's quarterly financial report, but not for the reasons you might think.\nIn the first quarter, Meta reported revenue that grew 27% year over year to $36.4 billion. Expenses grew more slowly, increasing just 6%, which helped drive operating margins to 38%, up from 25% in the prior-year quarter. This fueled robust profits, as earnings per share (EPS) surged 114% to $4.71.\nTo put the results into context, analysts' consensus estimates called for revenue of $36.14 billion and EPS of $4.32, so Meta sailed past expectations with ease.\nMeta also noted that the number of users of its family of social media sites grew 7% year over year to 3.24 billion, while advertising impressions across its family of apps jumped 20%.\nThat mostly sounds like a cause for celebration, so what caused the stock to plummet? Meta's plans for artificial intelligence (AI) and the associated spending. Meta raised its full-year forecast for capital expenditures to a range of $35 billion to $40 billion, up from its prior outlook of $30 billion to $37 billion. Meta said, \"We continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our AI roadmap.\" It also said capital spending to support AI will be even higher in 2025.\nSince generative AI burst on the scene last year, the demand to incorporate these advanced algorithms has been off the charts. Meta is one of just a few big tech companies with the resources to create the large language models needed to bring generative AI to life.\nThe company's Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) AI is widely regarded as being among the top AI systems in the world, though CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged, \"We're investing and scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\nWhile many analysts (slightly) reduced their price targets on Meta stock, sentiment was surprisingly upbeat. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill seemed to capture the prevailing mood on Wall Street, saying that investors should \"buy the [Zuckerberg] shopping cart dip.\"\nWith Meta stock selling for just 22 times forward earnings, he's not wrong.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  David Meyer ",
        "Text": "It looks like Meta\u2019s strategy of charging European Facebook and Instagram users, for the privilege of not being tracked for ad-targeting purposes, ain\u2019t gonna fly.\nMeta introduced the subscriptions late last year in an attempt to grapple with the implications of a bombshell July ruling by the EU\u2019s highest court, which found that Meta had no legal basis for tracking its users across its services and third-party sites unless it got their express consent to do so. But privacy advocates swiftly complained, arguing that it\u2019s not real consent if the only alternative is shelling out yet another monthly subscription fee\u2014originally as much as \u20ac12.99 ($13.82) for an account used on both mobile and the web, before Meta last month proposed a drop to \u20ac5.99 as a way of mollifying its critics.\nToday, Politico first reported that the European Data Protection Board (EDPB)\u2014the umbrella organization for the EU\u2019s various privacy regulators\u2014had decided that the privacy advocates complaining about what they derisively called Meta\u2019s \u201cpay or okay\u201d model had a point.\n\u201cIn most cases, it will not be possible for large online platforms to comply with the requirements for valid consent if they confront users only with a binary choice between consenting to processing of personal data for behavioral advertising purposes and paying a fee,\u201d the EDPB said in its opinion, published later in the day.\nEDPB Chair Anu Talus said platforms \u201cshould give users a real choice when employing \u2018consent or pay\u2019 models,\u201d adding: \u201cThe models we have today usually require individuals to either give away all their data or to pay. As a result most users consent to the processing in order to use a service, and they do not understand the full implications of their choices.\u201d\n\u201cOverall, Meta is out of options in the EU,\u201d said Max Schrems, the Austrian activist lawyer whose 13-year legal crusade against Meta is what gradually removed those options, in a statement. \u201cIt must now give users a genuine yes/no option for personalized advertising. It can still charge pages for reach, engage in contextual ads and alike\u2014but tracking people for ads needs a clear \u2018yes\u2019 by users.\u201d\nMeta has tried using various legal justifications for scooping up and processing European users\u2019 personal data over the years since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018\u2014with each being successively shot down by regulators as being an unacceptable reading of the privacy law. First Meta claimed that this tracking was part of its user contract, then that it had a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d in conducting targeted advertising, and now that it\u2019s getting genuine consent from those who choose to avoid the new fees.\nSchrems claimed that the introduction of subscription fees as the alternative increased the proportion of people agreeing to be tracked from 3% to over 90%. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a lawyer to see that it\u2019s not \u2018freely given\u2019 consent,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, five years after the GDPR came into force, this is just the latest \u2018trick\u2019 to undermine EU law or at least delay compliance for a few more years.\u201d\nMeta did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune.\nIn other European regulatory news, Apple\u2019s latest beta version of iOS makes it possible for EU iPhone users to directly download apps from developers\u2019 websites, rather than having to use an app store. Originally reported by MacRumors, that is part of Apple\u2019s tortuous journey toward compliance with the new Digital Markets Act, a blockbuster antitrust law. There are conditions, though, including Apple\u2019s insistence that apps can only be eligible if they\u2019ve already had at least a million first installs on iOS in the EU, in the previous year.\nMeanwhile, the European Commission is miffed that TikTok launched a new \u201cTikTok Lite\u201d app in France and Spain before conducting a legally required risk assessment about its potential impact on young people\u2019s mental health, in particular \u201cpotential stimulation of addictive behavior,\u201d Reuters reports. The app, which is supposed to be for over-18s, rewards its use with points that can be exchanged for Amazon vouchers and the like. TikTok\u2014which the Commission is already formally investigating under the new online-content law known as the Digital Services Act\u2014now has all of one day to submit that risk assessment.

        "Author": "  Aditya Soni and Kanchana Chakravarty ",
        "Text": "By Aditya Soni and Kanchana Chakravarty\n(Reuters) -Shares of Meta Platforms sank 13% on Thursday, sparking a selloff in big technology stocks after the social media firm signaled its costly bet on AI could take years to pay off.\nThe drop was set to erase nearly $170 billion from the company's market value and triggered a fall of 3% to 4.2% in shares of AI-focused Microsoft and Alphabet, both of which report earnings after market close.\nThe focus on AI spending, however, sparked a more than 2% jump in shares of Nvidia, Broadcom and Marvel Technology, which analysts have called the picks and shovels of the generative AI boom. Intel, which has missed out on the AI-led rally, was up 0.7% ahead of earnings.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who floored Wall Street last year with his cost-cutting drive, said on a post-earnings call that costs would grow \"meaningfully\" over the coming years before the company makes \"much revenue\" from some of its AI products.\nThat stoked investor fears that Zuckerberg was plunging Meta into another costly endeavor at a time when its augmented and virtual reality business was losing billions of dollars each quarter.\n\"Investors were caught off guard by higher capital expenditure, exacerbated by slightly softer second-quarter revenue guide. As such, shares are entering the 'penalty box,'\" Baird Equity Research analysts said.\nMeta forecast April-June revenue below estimates and raised the bottom end of its 2024 total expense forecast by $2 billion on Wednesday. It also raised the top end of its capital expenditure view as it invests in data centers essential to its efforts to catch up with AI frontrunners OpenAI and Microsoft.\nThe dour expectations follow a series of smash-hit earnings that helped Meta nearly triple its stock in 2023 and powered the biggest one-day market value gain by any company in Wall Street history, of $196 billion, in February after its maiden dividend.\nStill, several analysts were positive on the investments, pointing to AI-driven engagement on content such as Instagram Reels and the warm reception for its virtual assistant Meta AI and early versions of its latest large language model, Llama 3.\n\"We think this time it is different,\" Evercore ISI analysts said. \"This investment cycle comes from a position of strength, as management continues to see a healthy ad demand environment into Q2 and improving user engagement.\"\nOverall, 19 analysts lowered their price targets on the stock, while 13 raised their view, according to LSEG data. The median price target now stands at $525, which is about 6% higher than its previous close.\nThe stock has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 23.12, compared with Microsoft's 31.17 and Alphabet's 22.07. It has gained nearly 40% so far this year, comfortably above the benchmark S&P 500 index's 6% gain.\n\"Being on the offensive with investment spending is generally great, but in internet it is very hard to underwrite which of those investments will pay back and when,\" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said.\n\"All of this culminates with investors wondering just how long this investment cycle will last, whether the opportunity and payback is real, all against a backdrop of decelerating growth.\"\n(Reporting by Siddarth S and Kanchana Chakravarty in Bengaluru and Amanda Cooper in London; additional reporting by Johann M Cherian; Editing by Alun John, Janane Venkatraman and Anil D'Silva)\n"

        "Title": "Meta releases early versions of its Llama 3 AI model",
        "Author": "  Katie Paul ",
        "Text": "By Katie Paul\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Meta Platforms on Thursday released early versions of its latest large language model, Llama 3, and an image generator that updates pictures in real time while users type prompts, as it races to catch up to generative AI market leader OpenAI.\nThe models will be integrated into its virtual assistant Meta AI, which the company is pitching as the most sophisticated of its free-to-use peers, citing performance comparisons on subjects like reasoning, coding and creative writing against offerings from rivals including Alphabet's Google and French startup Mistral AI.\nThe updated Meta AI assistant will be given more prominent billing within Meta's Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger apps as well as a new standalone website that positions it to compete more directly with Microsoft-backed OpenAI's breakout hit, ChatGPT.\nA landing page greeting visitors on that site prompts them to try having the assistant create a vacation packing list, play 1990s music trivia with them, provide homework help and paint pictures of the New York City skyline.\nMeta has been scrambling to push generative AI products out to its billions of users to challenge OpenAI's leading position on the technology, involving a pricey overhaul of computing infrastructure and the consolidation of previously distinct research and product teams.\nThe social media giant has been openly releasing its Llama models for use by developers building AI apps as part of its catch-up effort, as a powerful free option could stymie rivals' plans to earn revenue off their proprietary technology. The strategy has elicited safety concerns from critics wary of what unscrupulous actors may use the model to build.\nMeta equipped Llama 3 with new computer coding capabilities and fed it images as well as text in training this time, though for now the model will output only text, Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said in an interview.\nMore advanced reasoning, like the ability to craft longer multi-step plans, will follow in subsequent versions, he added. Versions planned for release in the coming months will also be capable of \"multimodality,\" meaning they can generate both text and images, Meta said in blog posts.\n\"The goal eventually is to help take things off your plate, just help make your life easier, whether it's interacting with businesses, whether it's writing something, whether it's planning a trip,\" Cox said.\nCox said the inclusion of images in the training of Llama 3 would enhance an update rolling out this year to the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, a product made with glasses maker Essilor Luxoticca, enabling Meta AI to identify objects seen by the wearer and answer questions about them.\nMeta shares were up 1.8% late on Thursday.\nMeta also announced a partnership with Google to include its real-time search results in the assistant's responses, supplementing an existing arrangement with Microsoft's Bing search engine.\nThe Meta AI assistant is expanding to more than a dozen markets outside the U.S. with the update, including Australia, Canada, Singapore, Nigeria and Pakistan. Meta is \"still working on the right way to do this in Europe,\" Cox said, where privacy rules are more stringent and the forthcoming AI Act is poised to impose requirements like disclosure of models' training data.\nGenerative AI models' voracious need for data has emerged as a major source of tension in the technology's development.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg nodded at the competition with OpenAI in a video accompanying the announcement, in which he called Meta AI \"the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\"\nZuckerberg said the two smaller versions of Llama 3 rolling out now, with 8 billion parameters and 70 billion parameters, scored favorably against other free models on performance benchmarks commonly used to assess model quality. The biggest version of Llama 3 is still being trained, with 400 billion parameters, he said.\nThose results were \"undoubtedly impressive,\" but also indicative of a growing performance gap between free and proprietary models, said Nathan Benaich, founder of AI-focused venture firm Air Street Capital.\nDevelopers have complained that the previous Llama 2 version of the model failed to understand basic context, confusing queries on how to \"kill\" a computer program with requests for instructions on committing murder. Rival Google has run into similar problems and recently paused use of its Gemini AI image generation tool after it drew criticism for churning out inaccurate depictions of historical figures.\nMeta said it cut down on those problems in Llama 3 by using \"high quality data\" to get the model to recognize nuance. It did not elaborate on the datasets used, although it said it fed seven times more data into Llama 3 than it used for Llama 2.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New YorkAdditional reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San FranciscoEditing by Nick Zieminski and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Author": "  Avi Kapoor ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is scheduled to post earnings results for its first quarter, after the closing bell on Wednesday.\nAnalysts expect the Menlo Park, California-based company to report quarterly earnings at $4.32 per share, up from $2.20 per share in the year-ago period. Meta is projected to report quarterly revenue of $36.16 billion, up from $28.64 billion in the same quarter last year, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Meta has beaten revenue estimates from analysts in six straight quarters.\nOn April 22, Keybanc analyst Justin Patterson maintained Meta Platforms with an Overweight rating and lowered the price target from $575 to $555, while JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone reiterated the stock with a Market Outperform and maintained a $550 price target.\nWith the recent buzz around Meta Platforms, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, Meta Platforms has a dividend yield of 0.40%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 50 cents a share ($2.00 a year).\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Meta Platforms, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Meta's $2.00 dividend: $6,000 / $2.00 \u00a0= 3,000 shares\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $1,488,300 worth of Meta Platforms, or 3,000 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $2.00 = 600 shares, or $297,660 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\nView more earnings on META\nAlso Read: Investor Sentiment Improves Further, Dow Jumps Over 250 Points\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\nMETA Price Action: Shares of Meta Platforms rose 3% to close at $496.10 on Tuesday.\nRead More: Tesla, Boeing And 3 Stocks To Watch Heading Into Wednesday\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Meta Platforms Stock Ahead Of Q1 Earnings originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Text": "By Yuvraj Malik and Katie Paul\n(Reuters) -Meta Platforms is sharing its Quest headset's operating system with rival device makers, including Microsoft, for the first time, it said on Monday, as it works to extend its influence over the emerging virtual and mixed reality industry.\nThe move will allow partner companies to build their headsets using Meta Horizon OS, a rebranded operating system that brings capabilities like gesture recognition, passthrough, scene understanding and spatial anchors to the devices that run on it, the company said in a blog post.\nThe social media company said partners Asus and Lenovo would use the operating system to build devices tailored for particular activities. Meta is also using it to make a limited edition version of the Quest headset \"inspired by\" Microsoft's Xbox gaming console, according to the company's statement.\nThe move underscores Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's ambition to own the computational platform that powers virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) devices, similar to the way Alphabet's Google became a key player in the smartphone market by making its mobile OS Android open source.\nMeta's VR business is one of the beneficiaries of that Google strategy, as Meta Horizon OS is itself Android-based.\nIn a video posted on Zuckerberg's Instagram account, he previewed examples of specialized headsets partners might make: a lightweight device with sweat-wicking materials for exercise, an immersive high-resolution one for entertainment and another equipped with sensation-inducing haptics for gaming.\nMeta said in its blog post that ASUS' Republic of Gamers is developing a gaming headset and Lenovo is working on an MR device for productivity, learning, and entertainment using the Horizon OS. Zuckerberg said it may take a few years for these devices to launch.\nVR and MR headsets have so far seen limited adoption, mostly from the gaming community and select enterprises that use them for training or remote conferencing. Meta is the current market leader but is starting to face more pressure in the space.\nLong-time adversary Apple entered the category early this year with its $3,499 Vision Pro headset, while Google is also reportedly working on an Android platform for VR and MR devices. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth in March accused Google of pitching that system to partners with restrictive terms that could \"fragment the ecosystem.\"\nZuckerberg alluded to the disagreement in his video on Monday, saying he would welcome having Google Play apps on Meta Horizon OS devices, \"if they're up for it.\"\nGoogle did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMeta said the Meta Horizon OS includes Horizon Store, renamed from Quest Store, to download apps and experiences. The platform will work with a mobile companion app now called Meta Horizon app.\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru and Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Rosalba O'Brien)\n"

        "Title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, PDD Holdings and Apple",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 24, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, PDD Holdings Inc. PDD and Apple Inc's AAPL.\nHere are highlights from Tuesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nAfter a dismal 2022, Facebook-parent, Meta Platforms, Inc. made a terrific comeback last year. Meta Platforms delivered record sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 and joined the trillion-dollar market capitalization at the onset of 2024.\nA rebound in Meta Platforms' flagship ad business and its cost-cutting initiatives further bolstered expectations for bullish first-quarter 2024 earnings results, slated to be released on Apr 24, after market close.\nMeta Platforms is estimated to report earnings per share of $4.32 for the first three months of 2024, more than $2.64 a year ago, representing a jump of 63.6%. Moreover, Meta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +0.62%, a tell-tale sign that the stock has a good chance to surprise in the upcoming earnings announcement.\nMeta Platforms' shares, rightfully, soared around 37% in the first quarter. However, its shares are trading in the negative territory in April, more or less matching the broader market. Skeptics doubt Meta Platforms' big spending goal on generative AI and the Metaverse as it may impact the company's financials.\nYet, Meta Platforms' current hiccup is momentary. Instead, the company remains a market darling. This is because Meta Platforms' digital advertising business is gaining strength from e-commerce firms in China.\nDiscount shopping app, Temu has given stiff competition to Amazon.com, Inc. in China as it racked up solid sales in the past year. Now, PDD Holdings Inc., Temu's parent company has extensively used Meta Platforms' Instagram and Facebook platforms with ads for Temu, something that bodes well for the social media behemoth.\nInterestingly, Meta Platforms is currently teaming up with Amazon. Links will be provided on the Instagram and Facebook platforms for users to purchase goods from Amazon. This initiative will boost Meta Platforms' ad revenues as well as improve transaction growth for Amazon. What's more, competing rivals could further strike similar deals with Meta Platforms, a tailwind for the company.\nMeanwhile, the House of Representatives' inclination toward banning TikTok from operating in the United States should stand in good stead for Meta Platforms. TikTok is suspected of becoming a security threat as it influences public opinion in the United States. Nonetheless, banning TikTok will compel its audience to shift toward Instagram reels, and advertisements will follow.\nStatista, meanwhile, reported that the AI market is expected to see a CAGR of 15.83% from 2024 and 2030. Meta Platforms, thus, has joined the AI frenzy, which should help its shares gain traction. The company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg recently launched the Meta.ai chatbot. Meta Platforms has also launched an updated AI chip to enhance its data centers.\nMeta Platforms' bet on Metaverse somehow didn't look good for the company. Its Reality Labs division has been incurring losses for quite some time. But lately, with the launch of Quest 3, Meta Platforms' VR headset, sales from the Reality Labs division are poised to improve. Lest we forget, Mark Zuckerberg has already downplayed the threat from Apple Inc's Vision Pro headset.\nThe current year is also the 'Year of Efficiency' for Meta Platforms. The company has slashed umpteen jobs to streamline its operation. Such cost-cutting measures will help the company mitigate macroeconomic headwinds, apprehensions of a recession and higher interest rates. The company, anyhow, is cash-rich making it unperturbed to market upheavals. Meta Platforms' cash and cash equivalents were $65.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2023, up from $61.12 billion on Sep 30, 2023.\nTo top it, the net profit margin of Meta Platforms is nearly 29%, way higher than the 20% mark, indicating a high margin. In other words, the company has kept its operating expenses under check and is worthy of generating the necessary profit from sales. In reality, Meta Platforms have been efficiently generating profits since it has a return on equity of 29.5%, which is typically considered good.\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms enjoy an economic moat. Almost half of social media platform handlers globally are using Meta Platforms' applications. This diversification and huge audience base protect the company from any downside risk.\nThe social media giant also began paying dividends recently, and a passive income surely shouldn't bother any razor-sharp investor. Meta Platforms' annual dividend yield is 0.42%, which is less, but the company is just starting. Thus, Meta Platforms' shares have more upside left in the near future and is currently a compelling buy.\nMeta Platforms' expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 35.7% and 15.2%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next years is 18.2% and 12.8%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Meta Platforms' current-year earnings has moved up 1.8% over the past 60 days. Meta Platforms currently possess a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

You know what's cool? $40 billion in capex.\nMeta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg invoked an earlier Facebook era, when the social network transitioned to mobile phones, to remind investors that you must first spend money to make money.\nZuckerberg was right to remind investors about the concept of, well, investing because after glimpsing the sheer cost of an AI investment spree, Wall Street shoved Meta shares down an elevator shaft.\nWhile the News Feed, Reels, and Stories solidified the company's grow first, monetize later playbook, investors are still not fully on board with Zuckerberg's AI gambit.\nBy many important measures, Meta delivered a stellar quarter. But investors still recoiled at ballooning expenses and an admission that the company needs several more years before aggressive AI investments become profitable business lines. Capital expenditures are now expected to rise as high as $40 billion for the year, up from a high of $37 billion.\nThe check on Zuck's ambitions came as Meta shared a downbeat Q2 forecast. Investors have less patience for Meta's AI outlays when revenue growth isn't accelerating, especially given that it's a dividend-paying company now.\nThe rough reception to Meta's earnings provided a mirror image of Tesla's (TSLA) post-report surge. As Elon Musk's marketing alchemy showed earlier this week, a heavy sprinkling of visionary storytelling and market appeasement can mean more than what the numbers say. Where investors looked past Tesla's weakened financials and embraced Musk's latest fantasy, they brushed aside Meta's solid performance and stopped listening.\n\"I think it's worth calling that out, that we've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it,\" Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. He nodded to past transitions in the company's history, describing Meta's AI efforts as a multiyear work in progress.\nBut even Zuckerberg acknowledged that Meta's AI development will be a larger undertaking than monetizing Reels and Stories, which began as copycat features, and fed off an existing social media empire.\nZuckerberg's attempt to sell the concrete benefits of AI, of making particular the grand aspirations of a supposedly transformational technology, may also make them seem small.\n\"There are several ways to build a massive business here, including scaling business messaging, introducing ads or paid content into AI interactions and enabling people to pay to use bigger AI models and access more compute,\" Zuckerberg touted.\nAI curation systems are strengthening the engagement loop of more time on Meta's platforms and the delivery of more ads. In a first for Meta, more than half of the content people see on Instagram is AI recommended.\nThat may not be worth $40 billion. But it is something.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "Author": "  Alexei Oreskovic ",
        "Text": "Brace for turbulence, and have patience. That was Mark Zuckerberg's message to Meta shareholders on Wednesday as he explained his decision to plow tens of billions of dollars into a multi-year AI spending spree that will precede any meaningful payoff.\nThe cofounder and CEO of Meta, which owns Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, said that he'd recently become more optimistic about the company's prospects to dominate the highly competitive market for generative AI services, and that he'd concluded that \"it makes sense to go for it.\"\nThat may not sit well with investors, Zuckerberg acknowledged during the company's first quarter earnings call \u2014and shares of Meta were down by more than 15% after hours as he spoke. \"We've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook where we're investing and scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it.\"\nMeta said Wednesday that the capital expenditures to power its AI ambitions could total $40 billion this year, up to $5 billion more than it had earmarked in October. And costs will only go up in the years to come, the company said. \"This is likely going to take several years,\" he said.\nBut Zuckerberg also made a point to note that \"smart investors\" will recognize the opportunity at hand and be patient. After all, the company has been through this before, he said, pointing to investments in products like Reels and Stories that have since paid off.\nThe direct appeal to Wall Street for patience underscores the risk of the AI arms race that Meta is committing itself to. Microsoft reportedly plans to spend up to $100 billion to build a specialized AI datacenter with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. And Google-owner Alphabet has been investing heavily in AI for years.\nWhile Google and Microsoft both have cloud businesses that serve as vehicles to monetize their AI investments, Meta is not in the cloud business. But Zuckerberg hinted that charging for \"compute\" could be one avenue for generating revenue from its AI technology, along with its traditional advertising business.\nZuckerberg ascribed his increasing confidence in Meta's AI prospects to the company's recently released Llama 3 large language model, and the technology's consumer version of it, dubbed Meta AI in a few countries. Tens of millions of people have already tried Meta AI, Zuckerberg said, and the company is planning to roll it out to more users in the coming months.\nMeta doesn't generate any direct revenue when users interact with Meta AI right now, but Zuckerberg repeatedly pointed to the company's track record of monetizing its products when they reach sufficient scale\u2014he just didn't say when that moment would be.\n\"What we've\u00a0shown now is we have the ability to build leading models in our company so I think it makes sense to go for it. And we're going to. And I think it's going to be a good long term investment.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 22, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Tesla TSLA, Meta Platforms META, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\nMany in the market are looking to this week's quarterly results from the four members of 'the Magnificent 7' to help reverse the stock market's ongoing weakness.\nThe immediate catalyst for the stock market pullback appears to be tied to the timing of Fed easing as a result of the evolving inflation picture rather than any deterioration in the overall earnings picture. If anything, the overall earnings picture has actually been improving ever so slightly in recent weeks, as we have been noting in our earnings commentary.\nThe hope appears to be that robust results from the Mag 7 companies reporting this week \u2013 Tesla on Tuesday, April 23rd, Meta Platforms on Wednesday, April 24th, Microsoft and Alphabet on Thursday, April 25th \u2013 will help restore confidence in the market's fundamental underpinnings and offset some of the Fed-centric worries.\nAs the above chart shows, Meta is in a league of its own, while Microsoft and Alphabet are roughly tracking each other.\nThis pecking order, with Meta at the top and Tesla at the bottom, remains unchanged when we begin tracking from October 27, 2023.\nThis divergence in performance reflects each stock's earnings outlook, with Meta enjoying the best and Tesla the worst.\nThe current Q1 Zacks Consensus EPS for Meta of $4.32 has increased +20% since late January 2024. On the other hand, Tesla's Q1 EPS estimate of $0.46 has been cut by more than -41% over the same period.\nTesla's woes are well known, ranging from a distracted leader to fundamental supply-demand forces for its core product. Meta is benefiting from an improving digital ad market and effective cost controls.\nQ1 estimates for Microsoft and Alphabet have barely moved higher, with both largely seen as leading the AI effort. It is unlikely that we will see any tangible developments from either of these two companies on their respective AI strategies, but we will nevertheless get more clarity about the coming periods.\nThe group is expected to bring in +33% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +12.7% higher revenues.\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. The group jumped back into the 'regular/normal' growth model last year, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.4% from the same period last year on +8.3% higher revenues.\nAs was the case with the 'Mag 7', the Tech sector as a whole dealt with the pulled-forward revenues during 2021 but is expected to remain firmly in growth mode.\nThis week, we enter the heart of the Q1 earnings season, with more than 500 companies reporting results, including 155 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned mega-cap Tech players, we literally have a representative cross-section of the market on deck to report results this week.\nThrough Friday, April 19th, we have seen Q1 results from 71 S&P 500 index members. Total Q1 earnings for these 71 index members are up +9.4% from the same period last year on +4.5% higher revenues, with 77.5% beating EPS estimates and 63.4% beating revenue estimates.\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +3.8% from the same period last year on +3.9% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.9% revenue gains in the preceding period.\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.8% on +1.7% revenue growth.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Expectations are Moving Higher \nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "As the Artificial Intelligence (AI) race heats up primarily due to a boom in the generative AI space, the demand for cutting-edge chips that can handle AI-related massive workloads keeps rising. These chips are equipped with strong computing power that makes the training of large language models seamless.In this backdrop, strong endeavors being made by the cloud trio \u2014 Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL \u2014 as well as the social media giant Meta Platforms META, to put their AI-specific customized chips on the table remain noteworthy.This underscores the idea of staying self-sufficient in the intensifying AI battle in order to accelerate the development process of AI models, which, in turn, will help them pace up advancements in the AI world.\nNVIDIA NVDA, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is riding on solid demand for its next-generation chips for AI models. Reportedly, it holds more than 90% of the AI chips market. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.However, the strategy of building in-house chips of these tech giants in order to reduce dependency on outside chip providers does not bode well for NVIDIA. It will stiffen the chip competition for NVIDIA.Also, NVDA will start losing market share if its major customers start making their chips. This is a major concern.Notably, the waiting time for its flagship AI chip is months long, which is causing the scarcity. Nvidia can produce only a limited number of chips at a time because it depends on Taiwan Semiconductor to assemble the chip designs.This is the primary reason why AI behemoths are now coming up with their chips.Even if the chips being made by Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are not as strong as NVIDIA\u2019s, they can be customized. This will not only save their costs but will also save time.\n\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAlphabet\u2019s Google recently heated the AI battle with the introduction of its central processing unit (CPU), namely Axion, to support its AI work in data centers. Axion processors are marked as the company\u2019s first tailored Arm-based CPUs designed to deliver robust performance and energy efficiency. These CPUs deliver instances with up to 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances.Alphabet, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present, intends to scale Google services like BigTable, Spanner, BigQuery, Blobstore, Pub/Sub, Google Earth Engine and the YouTube Ads platform on Axion soon.Google will make Axion available to its cloud customers later this year. Customers will be able to use Axion in cloud services like Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Dataproc, Dataflow and Cloud Batch.Following Google\u2019s move, Meta announced advanced infrastructure for AI to push deep into the AI chip race. It introduced the next generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), which is a family of customized chips designed for Meta\u2019s AI workloads. MTIA will support new generative AI products and services, recommendation systems, and advanced AI research. Notably, MTIA is the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company\u2019s advancement over MTIA v1 \u2014 its first-generation AI inference accelerator, which was designed in-house with Meta\u2019s AI workloads.Notably, MTIA more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth. It is capable of managing the ranking and recommendation models that provide high-quality recommendations to users, seamlessly. The accelerator comes with an 8x8 grid of processing elements, which deliver increased dense compute performance (3.5x over MTIA v1) and a sparse compute performance.Meanwhile, Microsoft unveiled two customized chips, namely Maia 100 and Cobalt 100, late last year. While the Arm-based Cobalt 100 is made for general computing tasks, Maia 100 is designed for AI purposes.Notably, Maia 100 AI accelerator is capable of running cloud AI workloads like LLM training and inference. It is powered by a 5-nanometer TSMC process and has 105 billion transistors. The Zacks Rank #3 company collaborated with OpenAI on the design and testing phases of Maia. It is currently being tested on Bing\u2019s AI chatbot Copilot, the GitHub Copilot coding assistant and GPT-3.5-Turbo.Amazon, which carries a Zacks Rank #3, unveiled AWS Trainium2 chips made for training and running AI models. These chips are designed to power the highest-performance compute on AWS for training foundation models quickly at a lower cost, while consuming less energy. Further, they are capable of delivering up to 4 times better performance and two times better energy efficiency than the first-generation Trainium, which was introduced in 2020.Notably, a cluster of 100,000 Trainium chips can train a 300-billion parameter AI large language model in weeks versus months. Trainium 2 chips will be available in Amazon EC2 Trn2 instances, containing 16 Trainium chips in a single instance.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  RANDALL CHASE ",
        "Text": "DOVER, Del. (AP) \u2014 A Delaware judge on Tuesday dismissed a shareholder lawsuit asserting novel claims about the roles of corporate leaders and arguing that the loyalties of Meta directors and company founder Mark Zuckerberg should not lie exclusively with the social media giant.\nJames McRitchie, who runs a website focused on corporate governance and shareholder activism, argued that Meta\u2019s directors have breached their duties to the company by putting profits over broader societal and economic interests, including Meta shareholders\u2019 diversified investments in other companies.\nIn a 101-page opinion citing court rulings dating back more than 200 years, decades of law review articles and legal treatises, and even a Sherlock Holmes short story, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster rejected McRitchie\u2019s claims.\nLaster noted that, under the \u201cstandard Delaware formulation\u201d of corporate law, directors of a corporation owe duties to the stockholders as investors in that corporation.\n\u201cThe plaintiff has not made a persuasive case for change,\u201d Laster wrote. \u201cAt most, he has shown that some academics \u2014 primarily from the law and economics school \u2014 have assumed that a diversified-investor model is the norm. He has also shown that some investor advocacy organizations would prefer that model.\u201d\nWhile Delaware law requires corporate directors to act in the best interests of their stockholders, including maximizing the value of their shares, attorneys for McRitchie argued that Delaware courts should recognize a \u201cportfolio theory\u201d of corporate governance that takes into account external factors.\nThey argued, for example, that Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, has prioritized profits while downplaying the detrimental effects of its products on society and the global economy. That, in turn, they said, can negatively affect the investment portfolios of Meta shareholders who also have invested in other companies.\nAmong the \u201cnegative externalities\u201d the lawsuit blamed on Meta\u2019s social media platforms are mental health problems among young Instagram users, online human trafficking, \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d incitements to violence, and \u201celection misinformation.\u201d\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The upcoming report from Meta Platforms (META) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $4.32 per share, indicating an increase of 63.6% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $36.25 billion, representing an increase of 26.6% year over year.\nThe current level reflects an upward revision of 1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\nBefore a company reveals its earnings, it is vital to take into account any changes in earnings projections. These revisions play a pivotal role in predicting the possible reactions of investors toward the stock. Multiple empirical studies have consistently shown a strong association between trends in earnings estimates and the short-term price movements of a stock.\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\nIn light of this perspective, let's dive into the average estimates of certain Meta Platforms metrics that are commonly tracked and forecasted by Wall Street analysts.\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Revenue- Reality Labs' will likely reach $525.62 million. The estimate points to a change of +55.1% from the year-ago quarter.\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Revenue- Family of Apps (FoA)' should come in at $35.89 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +26.8%.\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Revenue- Advertising' will reach $35.59 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +26.7%.\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- Other' will reach $277.35 million. The estimate suggests a change of +35.3% year over year.\nAnalysts expect 'Advertising Revenue- US & Canada' to come in at $16.13 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +26.9% year over year.\nAnalysts predict that the 'Advertising Revenue- Asia-Pacific' will reach $7.30 billion. The estimate points to a change of +23.8% from the year-ago quarter.\nThe consensus estimate for 'Advertising Revenue- Rest of the World' stands at $4.14 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +28.4%.\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Advertising Revenue- Europe' at $8.19 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +30.6% year over year.\nAnalysts' assessment points toward 'Monthly active users (MAUs) - Worldwide' reaching 3,086.69 million. Compared to the current estimate, the company reported 2,989 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Daily Active Users (DAUs) - Worldwide' should arrive at 2,129.76 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 2,037 million.\nAnalysts forecast 'Daily Active Users (DAUs) - Europe' to reach 310.51 million. The estimate is in contrast to the year-ago figure of 307 million.\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Daily Active Users (DAUs) - Rest of World' of 689.60 million.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms META, Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG, Walt Disney Co. DIS, Consolidated Edison Inc. ED and S&P Global Inc. SPGI.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nThe first-quarter 2024 earnings season will kick off this week, with the banking sector slated to report numbers. There has been a deceleration in the earnings outlook in recent months, with negative revisions for several key sectors since the start of the first quarter.\nWhile most of the stocks are expected to outperform this earnings season, we have zeroed in on the best stocks of the sectors that have a high chance of surprising in their upcoming releases. These stocks \u2014Meta Platforms, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Walt Disney Co., Consolidated Edison Inc. and S&P Global Inc. \u2014 could make great plays as the earnings season unfolds and will likely move higher in the days to come.\nTotal S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up 2.2% from the same period last year on 3.4% higher revenues, per the latest Earnings Trends. This would follow 6.8% earnings growth in the fourth quarter on 3.9% higher revenues. Though estimates have steadily come down since the quarter began, the magnitude of cuts compared favorably with the recent periods. In fact, estimates have come down for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors.\nOf the 16 Zacks sectors, eight are expected to post earnings growth in the first quarter, with the Technology sector (19.4%) recording the strongest gain. It would be followed by Retail (13.5%), Consumer Discretionary (11.2%), Utilities (5.8%) and Business Services (5.9%).\nAn earnings beat will definitely inspire investors' confidence and propel the price of these stocks higher. Picking the star performers would be easy if we go by our proprietary methodology that selects stocks with a combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank \u2014 Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nEarnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions.

        "Title": "The \u2018Meta AI mafia\u2019 brain drain continues with at least 3 more high-level departures",
        "Author": "  Sharon Goldman ",
        "Text": "AI talent is in such high demand that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly taken to wooing top AI engineers and researchers with personal appeals. But Meta is also losing experienced AI talent who are jumping ship to work at AI startups.\nAt least three high-level Meta AI employees have departed the company in the past few weeks to strike out on their own. These include computer scientist and senior director of engineering Erik Meijer, who in an exclusive interview with Fortune said he had declined \u201cstellar offers\u201d from several of the \u201cmost sought-out\u201d AI companies.\nMeijer, who announced his departure from Meta on X last week, said he is not looking for a new role, but has a startup in the works: He is building an AI assistant platform for enterprises called Automind, and an end-user scripting language called Universalis.\nIn addition, Devi Parikh, Meta\u2019s senior director of generative AI, also left last week, saying on X she was \u201cnervous, because who in their right mind walks away from the job I had in times like these (leading research efforts in generative media and multimodal LLMs)?!\u201d And research scientist Abhishek Das said working at Meta FAIR (Fundamental AI Research) had been \u201cone of my most cherished career journeys,\u201d but that he is \u201cexcited to build something new.\u201d\nThe race is on in Big Tech to court top AI talent, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has taken to penning personal emails to Google DeepMind researchers, as well as offering sky-high pay packages, to try to persuade them to come to Meta, according to a recent report from The Information.\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Meijer and the others from jumping ship: He had previously led Meta\u2019s Probability team, a 50-person research group focused on machine learning infrastructure. The entire team was laid off in November 2022, but Meijer stayed on at Meta working in the organization running PyTorch, an open source machine learning framework that helps speed research prototyping to production deployment.\nIn explaining his new, as-yet-unnamed startup, he said that knowledge workers have to interact with so many applications specialized for specific problems, which requires mastering different systems and constantly switching between apps.\n\u201cWhat you want is a single, fully personalized application that can help you solve any problem,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have been thinking about this for decades or even centuries. With generative AI, this finally becomes possible.\u201d\nWhile many startups are looking to build this kind of \u201cintelligent agent,\u201d he said few have the kind of enterprise focus that tackles security and privacy and is reliable and scalable.\n\u201cI often joke that the \u2018chat with your PDF in five-minute\u2019 solutions are like the old \u2018get fit quick\u2019 ads on the back of comic books,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no shortcuts.\u201d\nMeijer said he believes that if you want to build things on top of LLMs, it\u2019s better to do so outside the big companies. Competitive pressure is leading to ever-more-powerful models, longer context windows (which determine how much data you can feed an AI model at one time), and lower prices, he explained. Thousands of developers are now fine-tuning, optimizing, and shrinking models like Meta\u2019s Llama (which he called a \u201cbrilliant move\u201d by the company). It all makes for what Meijer called a unique era in the tech industry \u201cwhere the pace of research and innovation is absolutely breathtaking. His aim, he added, is \u201cto surf that wave as far and hard as I can.\u201d\nThat said, Meijer emphasized that if one is interested in creating and training new general-purpose models, there is no choice but to join Big Tech, because it costs billions to train LLMs. But \u201cfor what I want to do I do not need access to compute,\u201d he explained, since he will simply be using an API. As for doubts about the success of LLM \u201cwrapper\u201d startups, he pointed out that for complex wrappers like what he has in mind, companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, or Anthropic are unlikely to tackle them.\n\u201cI mean, you can say that Facebook is a wrapper on top of MySQL, but that does not imply that it is easy for Oracle to replicate or replace it,\u201d he said, referring to an open-source database management system that is widely used in the industry and which was originally developed by Oracle.\nStill, many have wondered about the timing of the recent Meta departures. But Meijer posited it might be a result of the yearly performance review rhythm. \u201cEarly in the current AI wave people left Google to found OpenAI, Cohere, and then Anthropic,\u201d he said. \u201cEven in 2022 people were talking about the \u2018Meta AI mafia,\u2019 and conversely, lots of people that try startups and fail boomerang back to the Big Tech companies.\u201d\nThe ebb and flow of leaving established companies to venture out on your own and returning is \u201cthe essence of Silicon Valley,\u201d he noted. \u201cThat said, this is probably the best time in tech history to strike out on your own.\u201d\nAnshumali Shrivastava, an associate professor in the department of computer science at Rice University, agreed, telling Fortune: \u201cThis is arguably the inflection point in technology with AI,\u201d and that it is hard for established companies to move at a pace innovators want. \u201cThe upper management at large companies simply cannot move at a disruptive pace to risk their existing customer base and market,\u201d he explained.\nStill, he said, there is a limited window of opportunity for those willing to jump ship. \u201cFor all the great talent in AI, if \u2026 they had a dream of being the driving force into the future, this seems like the optimal time,\u201d he added. \u201cTechnology is there, the market is bubbling, and VCs have opened the banks for risk takers. Who will not do it?\u201d\nBut Shrivastava also pointed out that in Silicon Valley, those leaving Big Tech to start companies building solutions to targeted problems may one day end up having their companies acquired by their previous employer\u2014or a close competitor with the same problem. \u201cNote that the Silicon Valley VC ecosystem is run by past executives of successful Big Tech companies, most of whom have seen all this firsthand, and they have a niche in identifying and supporting such opportunities,\u201d he explained.\nArvind Narayanan, professor of computer science at Princeton University, agreed that once the fog settles and it becomes clear which apps are most useful, incumbents often start to dominate again through a combination of building and acquiring. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s a new platform or layer of the technology stack, there is an opportunity for startups to build apps on top of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw this with the PC, the web, mobile app stores, and now we\u2019re seeing it with generative AI.\u201d With departures from Meta and other Big Tech companies, the action is shifting to a new layer, he explained, \u201cand the cycle repeats.\u201d\nMeijer, however, says he continues to be \u201cbullish\u201d on Meta \u201cas long as Mark is in charge and keeps investing in AI.\u201d\nAnd even though he and his team were laid off from Meta\u2019s Probability team in 2022, that pivot turned into an AI advantage.\n\u201cRight around the time of the layoffs, ChatGPT came out, and I immediately realized that much of what we aimed for in Probability that was hard or impossible was now within reach,\u201d he explained. \u201cHaving no team to support anymore allowed me to jump headfirst into the new world of generative AI.\u201d Much of Probability\u2019s attention was aimed at developer productivity, but after playing with ChatGPT it was obvious that the problem of developer productivity was essentially solved.\n\u201cSo I changed my attention to AI-based productivity for general knowledge workers, which is a much larger segment than developers,\u201d he said. \u201cAs weird as it sounds, I am actually rather grateful that I was more or less forced to pivot from developing custom models to working on top of foundation models due to the layoffs. And during my tenure at the company I got to support some amazing teams and pioneer the field of AI for productivity when everyone thought that was a bat-crazy idea. So I only look back with fond memories and a sense of pride for what my people accomplished.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Sheraz Mian ",
        "Text": "We have Apple and Amazon on deck to report Q1 results this week, and we will need to wait a few more weeks before we see Nvidia\u2019s numbers. But we have already seen Q1 results from the other four members of the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 group: Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META, and Tesla TSLA.\nIt is hard to find any weakness in the Microsoft and Alphabet reports, and the market\u2019s reaction to these two reports shows that investors agree with that assessment. The Alphabet report appears to reassure investors that it has a credible AI strategy in place and may not be that far behind Microsoft in this critical race.\nThe market reaction to the Tesla and Meta reports needs to be contextualized.\nMeta shares were very strong performers prior to this report, and any way you look at the company\u2019s Q1 results, they are impressive. Meta\u2019s Q1 earnings were up +80.5% from the year-earlier period on +27.3% higher revenues. Investors\u2019 beef with the Meta report is the company\u2019s guidance for capital expenditures, which is going up significantly to strengthen the company\u2019s AI capabilities.\nI think the reaction is overdone, but it likely reminds investors of the pain created by the company\u2019s earlier metaverse plans. Perhaps there is a basis for those worries, given the metaverse history. But as we are seeing with Microsoft and Alphabet, leadership in AI requires a lot of spending. If market participants are okay with Microsoft and Alphabet spending hands-over-fist on AI, then they should also be okay with Meta.\nTesla shares have been the worst performing of the group, with many starting to speak out that perhaps it didn\u2019t deserve to be part of this group. The stock price weakness reflects the steadily deteriorating earnings outlook, with a combination of softening demand and heightened competitive pressures forcing Elon Musk to cut prices. You can see this in the chart below, which plots the stock price relative to how EPS estimates for this year and next have evolved.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGiven this stock\u2019s price action and estimates revision trajectory coming into the quarterly release, investors were conditioned to expect the worst from Tesla, but the actual results were simply bad (instead of \u2018very bad\u2019). They missed on the top- and bottom lines and didn\u2019t provide any favorable or reassuring commentary about the outlook. But investors were relieved that the numbers weren\u2019t as ugly as they had started fearing.\nTesla shares are still laggards relative to other Mag 7 stocks, as the year-to-date performance chart shows.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nUsing estimates for Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia, which will release their March-quarter results on April 30th, May 2nd, and May 22nd, respectively, and actual results for the other four members of the group, total Q1 earnings for the group are expected to be up +43.7% from the same period last year on +13.2% higher revenues.\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s Q1 earnings and revenue growth performance in the context of what we saw from the group in the preceding quarter and what is currently expected for the next three quarters.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 29.1% of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 20.6% of the index\u2019s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 21.6% of all S&P 500 earnings.\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings contribution to the index over time and what is currently expected for the next two years.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGiven the group's enormous earnings power and growth profile, it is hard to argue with its market leadership.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +27.1% from the same period last year on +8.7% higher revenues.\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming four periods.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEarnings Season Scorecard and This Week\u2019s Earnings Reports\nWe remain in the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with more than 950 companies reporting results, including 177 S&P 500 members.

        "Title": "Better Magnificent Seven Stock: Nvidia vs. Meta Platforms",
        "Author": "  Leo Sun, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) have been the two best-performing \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks over the past 12 months. Nvidia's stock surged more than 230% as the explosive growth of the AI market drove more companies to upgrade their data center GPUs to process complex AI tasks. Meanwhile, Meta's stock rallied nearly 140% as the growth of its advertising business accelerated again.\nBut should investors still buy either of these high-growth tech stocks today?\nNvidia once generated most of its revenue by selling discrete GPUs for gaming PCs. But over the past few years, the chipmaker rolled out higher-end GPUs for accelerating machine learning and AI tasks at data centers.\nThat move gave it a firm foothold in the growing AI market, and its sales of data center GPUs soared and eclipsed it sales of gaming GPUs. It generated 78% of its revenue in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January) from data center GPUs.\nIts revenue soared 126% that year as its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 288%. That marked an astonishing acceleration from its flat revenue growth and 25% adjusted EPS decline in fiscal 2023.\nMost of its growth was driven by the rising popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms, which prompted more companies to buy its data center GPUs to upgrade their own AI capabilities. Its sales of gaming GPUs also stabilized in the second half of the year as the PC market recovered.\nIn fiscal 2025, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 81% and 89%, respectively, as the AI market continues to expand. Based on those expectations, Nvidia's stock still looks reasonably valued at 37 times forward earnings. Its smaller rival AMD (NASDAQ: AMD), which is growing at a slower rate, trades at 49 times forward earnings.\nNvidia remains the top seller of shovels and picks for this AI gold rush, but investors shouldn't ignore the longer-term threats. AMD is already rolling out cheaper data center GPUs, major customers like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google are developing their own first-party AI chips, and other major chipmakers like Intel and Qualcomm are teaming up to develop an open source alternative to Nvidia's closed-source CUDA programming platform. All of these challenges could prevent Nvidia from monopolizing the booming market for AI accelerator chips.\nMeta served 3.98 billion monthly active people across its entire family of apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp) at the end of 2023. But back in 2022 its revenue and EPS fell 2% and 38%, respectively. That slowdown was caused by Apple's privacy changes on iOS (which disrupted its ability to mine data from third-party apps), tough competition from ByteDance's TikTok and other social media apps, and the macro headwinds for digital ads.\nAs Meta's advertising business sputtered out, it ramped up its spending on its unprofitable Reality Labs segment, which houses its virtual and augmented reality devices. That mix of slowing revenue growth and rising expenses spooked the bulls.\nBut in 2023 Meta's revenue and adjusted EPS grew 16% and 73%, respectively. It successfully countered Apple's changes by collecting more first-party data with its AI algorithms, kept pace with TikTok by expanding its Reels short video platform, and attracted more ad dollars from Chinese gaming and e-commerce companies that were targeting overseas consumers. Those Chinese advertisers accounted for 10% of Meta's total revenue for the year.\nMeta continued to expand its Reality Labs division, yet it still generated enough cash to initiate its first dividend and raise its current buyback authorization by $50 billion. Those confident moves suggested that brighter days were ahead, and analysts expect its revenue and EPS to rise 17% and 35%, respectively, in 2024. It could even easily exceed those estimates if the U.S. government finally bans its top competitor TikTok this year.\nMeta's stock looks reasonably valued at 25 times forward earnings, but its growth could be throttled by other longer-term challenges. The Chinese advertisers that bought so many ads across its apps in 2023 could abruptly rein in their spending. TikTok might dodge a ban in the U.S. and ramp up the pressure on Instagram and Reels again, and Meta still needs to deal with several unresolved antitrust and privacy investigations in the U.S. and Europe.\nBoth of these Magnificent Seven stocks are solid long-term investments. But if I had to choose one over the other, I'd buy Nvidia instead of Meta for three simple reasons: It's growing a lot faster, it has a wider moat, and it doesn't look overvalued relative to its growth potential yet. Meta will remain the 800-pound gorilla of social media for the foreseeable future, but it will also likely face significantly more macroeconomic, competitive, and regulatory headwinds than Nvidia.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

Chief Product Officer Chris Cox said that model, Llama 2, has been downloaded 170 million times. Llama 2 was billed as open source, though its license included some restrictions such as requiring companies with more than 700 million users to ask for permission to use it.\nMeta, the world\u2019s largest social media company, is using Llama 3 to run its own in-app AI assistant, called MetaAI, which exists across several products, including Facebook, WhatsApp and Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban smart glasses. The MetaAI assistant will be updated for users on Thursday as well, the company said.\nMany major tech companies are racing to develop AI products and services, spending billions on high tech chips and employee resources to develop large language models and other AI-focused products. Meta is using AI to power its content feeds and recommendations, but also to improve ad targeting and its virtual reality headsets.\nLlama 3 is \u201cindustry leading on a number of benchmarks for models of this size,\u201d Cox said. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer playing catch-up to have a model that\u2019s best-in-class.\u201d\nThe company is also working on several iterations of Llama 3 that will be rolled out as updates, Cox added.\nMeta has used AI in its products for years, but has leaned more heavily into the new technology over the past year, with executives emphasizing the benefits in public appearances and interviews.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 April 29, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META and Tesla TSLA.\nWe have Apple and Amazon on deck to report Q1 results this week, and we will need to wait a few more weeks before we see Nvidia\u2019s numbers. But we have already seen Q1 results from the other four members of the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 group: Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Tesla.\nIt is hard to find any weakness in the Microsoft and Alphabet reports, and the market\u2019s reaction to these two reports shows that investors agree with that assessment. The Alphabet report appears to reassure investors that it has a credible AI strategy in place and may not be that far behind Microsoft in this critical race.\nThe market reaction to the Tesla and Meta reports needs to be contextualized.\nMeta shares were very strong performers prior to this report, and any way you look at the company\u2019s Q1 results, they are impressive. Meta\u2019s Q1 earnings were up +80.5% from the year-earlier period on +27.3% higher revenues. Investors\u2019 beef with the Meta report is the company\u2019s guidance for capital expenditures, which is going up significantly to strengthen the company\u2019s AI capabilities.\nI think the reaction is overdone, but it likely reminds investors of the pain created by the company\u2019s earlier metaverse plans. Perhaps there is a basis for those worries, given the metaverse history. But as we are seeing with Microsoft and Alphabet, leadership in AI requires a lot of spending. If market participants are okay with Microsoft and Alphabet spending hands-over-fist on AI, then they should also be okay with Meta.\nTesla shares have been the worst performing of the group, with many starting to speak out that perhaps it didn\u2019t deserve to be part of this group. The stock price weakness reflects the steadily deteriorating earnings outlook, with a combination of softening demand and heightened competitive pressures forcing Elon Musk to cut prices.\nGiven this stock\u2019s price action and estimates revision trajectory coming into the quarterly release, investors were conditioned to expect the worst from Tesla, but the actual results were simply bad (instead of \u2018very bad\u2019). They missed on the top- and bottom lines and didn\u2019t provide any favorable or reassuring commentary about the outlook. But investors were relieved that the numbers weren\u2019t as ugly as they had started fearing.\nTesla shares are still laggards relative to other Mag 7 stocks.\nUsing estimates for Amazon, Apple, and Nvidia, which will release their March-quarter results on April 30th, May 2nd, and May 22nd, respectively, and actual results for the other four members of the group, total Q1 earnings for the group are expected to be up +43.7% from the same period last year on +13.2% higher revenues.\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 29.1% of the S&P 500 index\u2019s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 20.6% of the index\u2019s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 21.6% of all S&P 500 earnings.\nGiven the group's enormous earnings power and growth profile, it is hard to argue with its market leadership.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +27.1% from the same period last year on +8.7% higher revenues.\nWe remain in the heart of the Q1 earnings season this week, with more than 950 companies reporting results, including 177 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Apple and Amazon reports, we literally have a representative cross-section of the market on deck to report results this week.\nThrough Friday, April 26th, we have seen Q1 results from 229 S&P 500 index members, or 45.8% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total Q1 earnings for these 229 index members are up +2.8% from the same period last year on +3.3% higher revenues, with 78.2% beating EPS estimates and 59.8% beating revenue estimates.\nLooking at Q1 as a whole, total S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +3.8% from the same period last year on +3.7% higher revenues, which would follow the +6.8% earnings growth on +3.3% revenue gains in the preceding period.\nLooking at the overall earnings picture on an annual basis, total 2024 S&P 500 earnings are expected to be up +8.3% on +1.7% revenue growth.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Breaking Down Q1 Earnings Results \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms Insiders Sold US$15m Of Shares Suggesting Hesitancy",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Over the past year, many Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n View our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nThe Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$473 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$511. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 9.3% of Andrew Bosworth's holding.\nInsiders in Meta Platforms didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\nIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).\nThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Meta Platforms. Specifically, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth ditched US$3.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.\nMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Meta Platforms insiders own 14% of the company, currently worth about US$176b based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.\nAn insider hasn't bought Meta Platforms stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. On the plus side, Meta Platforms makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms you should know about.\nBut note: Meta Platforms may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. shares fell the most in nine months Friday, taking the shine off stellar first-quarter financial results following management\u2019s decision to stop reporting quarterly subscriber data.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTaylor Swift Is Proof That How We Critique Music Is Broken\nBiden\u2019s Gains Against Trump Vanish on Deep Economic Pessimism, Poll Shows\nBiden\u2019s New Chopper Is Demoted After Scorching White House Lawn\nTesla Soars as Musk\u2019s Cheaper EVs Calm Fears Over Strategy\nThis metric has long been the primary way Wall Street evaluated the company\u2019s performance, but executives at Netflix, which now has almost 270 million subscribers, have tried to shift the focus to measures like sales and profit. Other tech giants like Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have taken similar steps in recent years.\nIn the past, subscriber numbers have been wildly unpredictable, and the company has struggled to forecast them accurately. In 2022, Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said it would stop projecting quarterly customer data. The stock typically sees big swings the day after earnings reports.\nOn Thursday, Netflix reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, including 9.33 million new subscribers. But the shares slumped after the company said user growth this quarter would slow and that it will stop reporting customer numbers.\n\u201cEliminating regular reporting of membership data raises questions around management\u2019s confidence to further grow the base, though it is not implausible that the change is intended to reduce quarterly sentiment volatility around relatively small changes in true economic drivers,\u201d Michael Morris, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, wrote in a note to investors.\nNetflix isn\u2019t the only big tech company to pull back on disclosing some metrics in order to steer investors\u2019 focus elsewhere.\nIn 2018, Apple said it would no longer report the number of iPhones, Macs and iPads sold each quarter, as it attempted to focus on its growing services unit. While some pundits praised the move as a way to highlight a potent new business model, others complained it was an attempt to hide the pain of a stagnant smartphone market. The shares had their worst day in four years.\nLast quarter, Meta said it will no longer report the number of subscribers to its family of apps, which now total almost 4 billion people who use Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp each month. The San Francisco-based company said it also won\u2019t provide daily and monthly user numbers for its flagship Facebook app.\nBeginning this quarter, Meta will report year-over-year changes in ad impressions and the average price per ad at the regional level, while continuing to report only daily active users across its family of apps.\n\u201cFewer disclosures is a rite of passage for large tech companies namely Apple, Google, and Meta,\u201d analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note. \u201cOn the other hand, removing growth disclosures signals a maturing business, and gives shareholders even fewer data points to underwrite forecasts. Time will tell how investors digest the change.\u201d\nThe good news for Netflix is that its decision, while angering some investors, is unlikely to have any impact on customers \u2014 its primary focus.\nIn 2011, the company was forced to backtrack on plans to split its mail-order DVD and internet streaming services. Customers were outraged over plans to create a separate DVD offering called Qwikster, and to pay for each service separately. The company reversed the decision three weeks later.\nNetflix\u2019s growth in the latest quarter was aided by a crackdown on account sharing, which pushes viewers using someone else\u2019s password to sign up on their own at a discounted rate. The company attracted new customers from all over the world, thanks to a strong slate of original programs, showing particular strength in the US and Canada. Those new subscribers helped the company beat forecasts for sales and earnings as well.\nIn explaining the decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers and average revenue per user, co-Chief Executive Officer Greg Peters said initiatives like the crackdown and a new ad-supported tier make those metrics less relevant.\n\u201cAll of that means that historical simple math that we all did, number of members times the monthly price is increasingly less accurate in capturing the state of the business,\u201d he said in a video interview Thursday.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nA Hedge Fund Billionaire\u2019s Cash Helped Fund a \u2018Predatory\u2019 Lender\nBig Junk Food\u2019s Campaign to Get You Eating Doritos and Oreos for Dinner\nHow a Massive Hack of Psychotherapy Records Revealed a Nation\u2019s Secrets\nChina\u2019s Bubble Tea Boom Creates a Half-Dozen Billionaires\nSkip the Robotaxi\u2014Tesla Investors Want a Cheap EV\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Earlier this week, Oppenheimer analysts raised revenue estimates for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) for the first quarter and the rest of 2024. The firm also slightly raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast from 12% to 13%.\nThe analysts see the additional growth coming from Meta's investments in artificial intelligence (AI), which is fueling more content recommendations and advertising products. Oppenheimer maintained an outperform (buy) rating on the shares with a $585 price target, representing a 12-month upside of about 14% over the current share price.\nAs with every other Magnificent Seven member, Meta Platforms is leaning more on AI across its business. Almost a third of recommended text, photo, and other posts in the Facebook Feed are driven by an AI-driven recommendation system. Advertisers can also take advantage of Meta's Advantage+ product which uses AI to automate ad campaigns.\nAs Meta continues to invest in AI, it should drive higher user engagement across the company's social media platforms and improve advertising performance. This could all have an impact on Meta's revenue and earnings growth and potentially benefit the stock.\nThe share price rocketed 140% over the last 12 months but still trades at a reasonable valuation of 26 times forward earnings estimates.\nThe Wall Street consensus has the company's earnings per share reaching $23.15 in 2025. If the shares are still trading at the same forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26 a year from now, the stock price would reach $600. So, the analyst's price target of $585 seems reasonable.\nHowever, if Meta can sustain double-digit earnings growth over the next five years, consistent with the Street's expectations, the stock could be worth significantly more in 2029.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jabin Bastian ",
        "Text": "Social network operator Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) will be reporting results tomorrow after the bell. Here's what investors should know.\nLast quarter Meta reported revenues of $40.11 billion, up 24.7% year on year, beating analyst revenue expectations by 2.4%. It was a strong quarter for the company, with optimistic revenue guidance for the next quarter and a decent beat of analysts' revenue estimates. The company reported 3.98 billion monthly active users, up 6.4% year on year.\nIs Meta buy or sell heading into the earnings? Read our full analysis here, it's free.\nThis quarter analysts are expecting Meta's revenue to grow 26.5% year on year to $36.23 billion, improving on the 2.6% year-over-year increase in revenue the company had recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $4.36 per share.\nThe analysts covering the company have been growing increasingly bullish about the business heading into the earnings, with revenue estimates seeing seventeen upwards revisions over the last thirty days.\u00a0The company missed Wall St's revenue estimates twice over the last two years.\nLooking at Meta's peers in the consumer internet segment, only Netflix has so far reported results, delivering top-line growth of 14.8% year on year, and beating analyst estimates by 1%. The stock was down 3.4% on the results.\nRead our full analysis of Netflix's earnings results here.\nInflation progressed towards the Fed's 2% goal at the end of 2023, leading to strong stock market performance. The start of 2024 has been a bumpier ride, as the market switches between optimism and pessimism around rate cuts due to mixed inflation data, and while some of the consumer internet stocks have fared somewhat better, they have not been spared, with share price declining 6% over the last month. Meta is down 4% during the same time, and is heading into the earnings with with analyst price target of $541.2, compared to share price of $482.7.\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

        "Author": "  Justin Dawes ",
        "Text": "Imagine you\u2019re visiting the Colosseum in Rome for the first time, and you want your friends to enjoy the same view through the lenses you\u2019re wearing.\nNow that\u2019s possible with updates to the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, according to Meta, the company that owns Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp.\nThe big tech company said this week that it is updating its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses with voice-activated AI tech that could be useful for travelers.\nTravel experts have said since generative AI was first released that it could lead to consumers having high-tech digital travel assistants in their pockets. The AI that powers these glasses is still far from fulfilling that vision, but it offers a new glimpse at how that future could look.\nThat includes the ability for hands-free video calling through WhatsApp and Messenger, enabling users to share their view through the lenses of the glasses.\nAnd, the update enables the AI to see and answer questions about what the user can see through the lenses. If the user is traveling in France and needs help translating a menu, the glasses can show the translated text without the need to look at a phone screen, according to Meta.\nThe user could also look at a building or monument and ask the glasses for more information about it, or ask about what to do in a new city. The response comes in an audio format or is shown via text that the wearer can see through the lenses.\nUsers can also ask the AI to control features, like playing music, or draft a caption for a photo that was just taken with the glasses.\nUsers activate the tech by saying, \u201cHey Meta,\u201d and then ask their question.\nTech influencer Cleo Abram posted a paid video in partnership with Ray-Ban and Meta displaying what the glasses can do, shown below.\nThe beta version of this technology, called Meta AI with Vision, is available to users in the U.S. and Canada.\n\u201cGlasses are the ideal device for an AI assistant because you can let them see what you see and hear what you hear. So they have full context on what\u2019s going on around you as they help you with whatever you\u2019re trying to do,\u201d said Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, during an investor call this week.\nMeta and Ray-Ban released the first version of these smart glasses in March 2022 \u2014 a more stylish redo of a similar product that Google stopped making in 2015.\nAlong with updated tech, the latest generation includes multiple new styles.\u00a0The glasses are built with an ultra-wide 12 megapixel camera, speakers, and five microphones, allowing users to take photos and videos that are automatically saved to their connected smartphones.\nThe AI integrated into the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses comes from Meta\u2019s latest generative AI tech model, called Llama 3.\nThe company last week released updated versions of its Meta AI chatbot \u2014 accessible through Whatsapp, Instagram, Messenger, and Facebook \u2014 based on the Llama 3 model.\nMeta released the first version of its Meta AI chatbot last October.\nIn the announcement of its latest version, Meta showed examples of how travelers could use the chatbots, such as asking for recommendations about restaurants, events, and flights.\nGet breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.\n"

        "Author": "  John Ballard, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) share price bottomed out in 2022, but the stock has soared to new highs as the digital advertising market showed signs of recovery. Analysts at Citigroup see growing user engagement on Instagram Reels leading to higher revenue in the near term, which could further boost the stock price.\nThe firm raised its price target on Meta from $525 to $590 -- a figure that's nearly 18% above the current $500 share price -- while maintaining a buy rating on the shares. Wall Street price targets are usually estimates for where a stock might trade in the next 12 months, so Citi is pointing to a catalyst that could have positive implications for Meta's growth beyond 2024.\nMeta has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which powers content recommendations and advertising across its family of apps. More advanced AI models will have a direct impact on the amount of time users spend browsing their feeds as the ads and content they see become more aligned with their interests.\nCiti analysts specifically noted positive momentum in its advertising load tracker for Instagram Reels. The bank's analysts believe Meta is seeing progress from recent ad innovations such as AI-recommended content and growing advertiser demand for Reels. As a result, the analysts raised their revenue estimates ahead of the company's first-quarter earnings report (scheduled for release on April 24). The Wall Street consensus estimate is that Meta's revenue increased by 18% year over year to $33.8 billion in the quarter.\nMeta is coming off a strong year of growth, with revenue and earnings both rising by double-digit percentages, and the analysts' consensus estimate is that its earnings per share will grow by 35% this year.\nGiven the company's high earnings growth, the stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 is attractive. It certainly isn't far-fetched to believe the stock could climb another 18% over the next 12 months to hit Citi's new price target.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

Notably, last quarter was its strongest first-quarter performance since 2019. The benchmark recorded 22 all-time highs in the last quarter.\nThe rally since the beginning of 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI. The rapid penetration of digital technologies and the Internet worldwide during the lockdown period, ushered in significant adoption of AI.\nWall Street's bull run in the first quarter got an added boost from the Fed's multiple rate cuts signal, to the surprise of a large section of financial pandits, who indiscriminately warned of overvaluation.\nMeanwhile, several S&P 500 behemoths are set to beat on earnings next week.

        "Title": "Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet All Just Shared Magnificent News for Nvidia Investors",
        "Author": "  Adam Levy, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "If you didn't think the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) could get any stronger, think again.\nFour of the biggest tech companies in the world all reported very strong demand for AI applications, and that's great news for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker designs the leading GPUs for training the large language models powering new generative AI applications. It could see a big increase in business based on recent management commentary from Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL).\nHere's what they had to say and what it all means for Nvidia and its investors.\nTesla plans to unveil its robotaxi in August. The Cybercab relies on Tesla's full self-driving (FSD) capabilities, which use artificial intelligence to make real-time driving decisions.\nTo train that AI, Tesla has rapidly expanded its AI training infrastructure. CEO Elon Musk says the company doubled its training compute power sequentially in the first quarter. What's more, he expects Tesla's cluster of 35,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs to expand to about 85,000 by the year's end, just for training its AI.\nThat's a huge investment coming Nvidia's way. It's also a major endorsement for Nvidia from Musk, who had previously considered other chipmakers' GPUs.\nMeta has been spending heavily to build out data centers to train its artificial intelligence, but now, it sees a good reason to spend even more.\nAlongside its first-quarter earnings release, Meta shared plans to increase its capital expenditures from its original range of $30 billion to $37 billion to somewhere between $35 billion and $40 billion when all is said and done in 2024. And the company expects to spend even more than that in 2025.\nThat's because CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees an opportunity for Meta to \"build leading AI models and be the leading AI company in the world.\"\nMeta has made excellent progress in just a few years developing its LLaMA large language model. It recently released version 3 of the model, rolling out its Meta AI chatbot alongside it. Zuckerberg thinks there are a lot of business opportunities for Meta if it can build an AI model used by hundreds of millions of people around the world.\nBut to get there, it has to spend heavily, and a lot of that spending will go toward Nvidia's chips, at least for the time being. Meta's also building its own custom silicon to train its AI.\nMeta's not the only company that's planning to increase its spending on AI infrastructure. Microsoft also expects a big step up in spending thanks to the growing demand for AI.\n\"Currently, near-term AI demand is a bit higher than our available capacity,\" CFO Amy Hood told analysts during Microsoft's fiscal third-quarter earnings call.\nMicrosoft set itself up as the leading public cloud service provider for AI application developers when it announced a $10 billion investment in OpenAI at the start of 2023. That move has paid off handsomely as the growing demand for AI has led Microsoft to take share from other public cloud competitors. But even as it invests in adding capacity, it seemingly hasn't been able to keep up.\nMicrosoft now plans to increase spending for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and fiscal 2025 in order to meet the growing demand. It's also developing its own AI using OpenAI's GPT model, which powers its Copilot software.\nAgain, a lot of the step up in spending will go toward buying more Nvidia chips for its cloud customers' needs. Microsoft, however, does design its own chips as well.\nThere were many market-pleasing surprises in Alphabet's first-quarter earnings report, but one should stand out to Nvidia's investors.\nAlphabet poured $12 billion into capital expenditures last quarter. That's nearly double what it spent during the year-ago period.\nAlphabet's investments will primarily go toward adding capacity to Google Cloud and building and training more advanced AI models. Alphabet is also integrating AI into search -- it recently rolled out AI-powered answers at the top of certain search queries.\nIt's worth noting Alphabet uses its own chip designs to train its Gemini model, but it will still commit some spending to Nvidia as its cloud customers demand those chips.\nWe're currently in the midst of an AI arms race. As Microsoft pointed out, the demand for AI compute is bigger than the supply.\nThat's been an incredible boon for Nvidia, which can't produce chips fast enough to supply everyone who wants them. As a result, its pricing power has gone through the roof. Its gross margin climbed from 56.9% in fiscal 2023 to 72.7% in fiscal 2024. The comments from its fellow Magnificent Seven companies suggest demand continues to outpace supply, which bodes well for Nvidia going forward.\nEven after an incredible run over the last couple of years, Nvidia could still benefit from the increased spending from big tech over the next two years. However, a lot of that spending is going toward developing and deploying those companies' own chip designs. Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta all design their own AI training and inference chips. Apple is reportedly working on its own AI data center chips as well.\nAs these big companies shift more of their AI workload to their own chip designs, it'll take a huge bite out of Nvidia's demand. And despite strong demand trends from smaller enterprises without in-house designs, it's hard to overcome that challenge.\nTo be sure, the next few years will likely be very good for Nvidia, but its position at the top of the AI food chain is rather precarious. With shares trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 35 as of this writing, investors are expecting very high sustained earnings growth for years to come. I'm not sold that Nvidia has the competitive moat to make that happen, even if the near-term demand appears extremely promising.\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $537,557!*\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The company says it's \u201cnow the most intelligent AI assistant you can use for free.\u201d As for use case scenarios, the company touts the ability to help users study for tests, plan dinners and schedule nights out. You know the drill. It\u2019s an AI chatbot.\nMeta AI, however, has expanded into just about every nook and cranny throughout the company\u2019s entire portfolio, after a test run with Instagram DMs last week. It\u2019s still available with Instagram, but now users can access it on Messenger, Facebook feeds and Whatsapp. The chatbot also has a dedicated web portal at, wait for it, meta.ai. You don\u2019t need a company login to use it this way, though it won\u2019t generate images. Those recently-released Ray-Ban smart glasses also integrate with the bot, with Quest headset integration coming soon.\nOn the topic of image generation, Meta says it's now much faster and will produce images as you type. It also handles custom animated GIFs, which is pretty cool. Hopefully, it can successfully generate images of different races of people. We found that it struggled with this basic concept a couple of weeks back, as it seemed biased toward creating images of people of the same race, even when prompted otherwise.\nMeta\u2019s also expanding global availability along with this update, as Meta AI is coming to more than a dozen countries outside of the US. These include Australia, Canada, Ghana, Jamaica, Pakistan, Uganda and others. However, there\u2019s one major caveat. It\u2019s only in English, which doesn\u2019t seem that useful to a global audience, but whatever.\nAs for safety and reliability, the company says Llama 3 has been trained on an expanded data set when compared to Llama 2. It also used synthetic data to create lengthy documents to train on and claims it excluded all data sources that are known to contain a \u201chigh volume of personal information about private individuals.\u201d Meta says it conducted a series of evaluations to see how the chatbot would handle risk areas like conversations about weapons, cyber attacks and child exploitation, and adjusted as required. In our brief testing with the product, we've already run into hallucinations, as seen below.\nAI has become one of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's pet projects, along with raising really expensive cattle for beef in a secluded Hawaiian compound, but the company\u2019s still playing catch up to OpenAI and, to a lesser extent, Google. Meta\u2019s Llama 2 never really wowed users, due to a limited feature set, so maybe this new version of the AI assistant will catch lightning in a bottle. At the very least, it should be able to draw lightning in a bottle, or more accurately, slightly tweak someone else\u2019s drawing of lightning in a bottle.\n"

        "Title": "Meta, Alphabet, and Microsoft earnings will be all about AI and whether one of them deserves to be on the \u2018wall of worry\u2019",
        "Author": "  Rachyl Jones ",
        "Text": "Since the blockbuster debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT in November 2022, the topic of AI has dominated the earnings calls of many tech companies. Executives from Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have mentioned the acronym nearly 200 times in each earnings cycle since, including during the first earnings week this year in January and February.\nAnalysts expect AI to be the central theme yet again during earnings calls for the first three months of this year, with Meta reporting on Wednesday, followed by Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet on Thursday. But the talk from executives has shifted from \u201cwhat AI can do?\u201d to \u201cwhat AI is doing?,\u201d and all three of this week\u2019s Big Tech companies will have a different answer.\nFor Microsoft, cloud computing platform Azure is the star of its AI portfolio, according to analysts from Goldman Sachs and Citi. Launched more than a decade ago, Azure now offers a suite of AI tools to businesses including a service that builds custom generative AI apps from existing models. Azure is \u201cone of the best-positioned AI players\u201d in the market and the \u201cmain lever\u201d for Microsoft to make money on generative AI right now, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a Sunday note to investors. That confidence partly comes from Microsoft not having to drastically change how it makes money to drive additional revenue from AI, they wrote.\nIn contrast, most of Google\u2019s revenue comes from search and related services, which AI from other companies could eventually replace. Google could cannibalize its search business by building a rival AI one, but that would leave it in a precarious position.\nAzure\u2019s business grew 30% year-over-year for the quarter ending December 31, with six points of that growth coming directly from the demand by its customers for AI-related products, CFO Amy Hood said during the company\u2019s earnings call. Expect an additional one to two percentage points of growth from AI services for the first three months of 2024, Citi analysts said in an April 18 report. Microsoft also has other budding AI businesses that the analysts say will contribute meaningfully to revenue next year\u2014namely, the company\u2019s virtual assistant, Copilot.\nAnalysts are generally less confident in Google\u2019s business than in Microsoft\u2019s, with Goldman analysts calling its parent\u2019s stock a \u201cwall of worry.\u201d In addition to questioning the growth of\u00a0 Google\u2019s search business in an AI future, investors worry about the company\u2019s operating margins and the impact of potential regulation. Investors will also have \u201ca heightened degree of concern\u201d about how much Google is spending on AI over the coming earnings seasons, Goldman\u2019s analysts wrote.\nStill, Google is a leader in the AI cloud world, which includes many of the services it offers to other businesses, Goldman analysts said in an April 15 report. At Google\u2019s Cloud Next event earlier this month, the company announced expanded access to large language model Gemini and an AI-powered coding assistant.\nWhile Meta offers an AI assistant and large language model similar to Microsoft\u2019s and Google\u2019s\u2014including its new Llama 3 model introduced last week, which is free for research and commercial use\u2014that\u2019s not what analysts have their eyes on. In notes from Goldman, Citi, and Bank of America, analysts put much more emphasis on how Meta is using AI to improve its social media algorithms.\nMeta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, makes most of its money from advertising. The more time users spend scrolling through their feeds, the more ads they see, and the more revenue Meta generates. In recent months, the company has been working on rebuilding its model for recommending videos to Facebook users, with the help of AI. If effective, the tweak could keep users on Meta\u2019s platforms for longer. When tested on Facebook Reels last year, the new AI-powered technology contributed to \u201can 8% to 10% gain in Reels watch time,\u201d Facebook head Tom Alison said at a tech conference last month.\nIt is still early for these tools, Bank of America analysts said in an April 19 note, but that means investors could enjoy some \u201cpositive product surprises\u201d and revenue growth this year. And with a potential U.S. ban on TikTok, a major competitor, Meta's business is looking well positioned at the moment, they said.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Meta's Latest Challenge: Advertisers Are Revolting. Should Investors Be Worried?",
        "Author": "  Jeremy Bowman, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has been no stranger to controversy, but in the eyes of investors, the stock has done everything right in the past year and a half. Meta's stock price has soared more than 300% since the start of 2023 as ad revenue growth has bounced back. The company has slashed expenses following its \"year of efficiency,\" and has regained investor trust.\nHowever, there are now warning signs that momentum could be falling apart.\nAdvertisers have taken to social media, saying that the company's ad platform is broken and that ad rates are unrealistic and unsustainable. Some small and medium-sized businesses, which make up Meta's core advertising customers, have pulled back on ads, shut off advertising on Facebook and Instagram entirely, or shifted their budgets to other platforms like Alphabet's Google and ByteDance's TikTok.\nYou can see some of the complaints posted to X below.\nMeta slashed more than 20,000 jobs last year in an effort to increase profitability, flatten the management structure, and streamline the business. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been pleased with the results, and not just because profits are up. On a recent earnings call, Zuckerberg said, \"I feel like I've really come around to thinking that we operate better off as a leaner company.\"\nThat might be true, but based on the protests above, it seems like the social media giant may have cut too close to the bone. Last April, layoffs of engineers and related tech teams reportedly hammered employee morale, and one Meta advertiser I spoke to said they think layoffs are directly responsible for the problems with the advertising platform. They said Meta's \"entire ad platform feels broken.\"\nMeanwhile, advertisers are going to other platforms. Though it's not a total storming-off, even from those who are upset. Cody Plofker, whose post from X is above, told Bloomberg recently that the bad of marketing with Meta comes with the good. \"There is a lot of volatility, but there is also a lot of upside as well,\" he said.\nMeta stock is in a much different position than it was a year ago when it was cheap and priced as a potential turnaround. These days, the stock might not quite be priced for perfection, but it is priced for success at a price-to-earnings ratio of 35, and up until now, there's been little indication that the layoffs have been anything but a win for the business.\nMeta will have to fix the engineering problems in its ad platform. That will cost money, but it's a cheaper solution than letting its advertisers flee to rival platforms.\nIt's unclear if these challenges impacted the company's first-quarter results, but there are likely to be some questions about it on the first-quarter earnings call on April 24.\nMeta has faced plenty of challenges in the past, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the Stop Hate for Profit boycott in 2020, Apple's ad tracking crackdown, and its questionable pivot to an expensive metaverse development project. Every time, the company has adapted and recovered, which is why the stock again trades at or near all-time highs.\nMeta's products are entrenched enough that even mismanagement of its ad platform wouldn't kill the business. After all, roughly half of the world's population uses one of its products regularly, and millions of advertisers depend on it as their primary customer acquisition tool.\nHowever, the advertiser backlash could be significant, and Meta will have to fix it as it will only get worse as it persists. It's unclear how long it might take to fix it, but it could weigh on the business over at least the next few quarters.\nThis isn't a mortal threat to Meta by any means, but investors who are sitting on ample profits after the stock's surge should consider taking some of those profits off the table, especially with the stock trading at a premium. Further gains with this issue hanging over its head will be difficult.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Good news for Facebook socialites sharing cat memes, inspired status updates and photo galleries of fun nights out.\nThe already-massive Tennessee hub for Meta's data storage and processing is expanding.\nTwenty miles north of Nashville, in the relatively quaint town of Gallatin, a collection of colossal server farms that store Meta's content in Tennessee and beyond will add a fifth warehouse location. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, recently filed a site-plan request to begin construction on a 276,000-square-foot data center.\nLike the four other data centers at the Gallatin Industrial Park, this new building will be filled with tens of thousands of humming, rectangular servers connected by fiber optic cables.\n\"They have this down to an art \u2014 building these data centers,\" Gallatin Economic Development Agency Interim Director Rosemary Bates said. \"They have their own concrete batch plant and an electric substation with a direct feed from Tennessee Valley Authority.\"\nMeta's growth will be a windfall for the city's tax rolls and for local charitable contributions, Bates said.\n\"We\u2019re happy they can go ahead and add this fifth building,\" Bates added. \"They contribute a great deal to local nonprofits and our school system.\"\nSince construction on the 800-acre data farm began in 2020, Meta said it has donated nearly $1 million to Sumner County schools.\nThe company has invested more than $1 billion to develop the server farm and plans to continue growing to fill out its 800-acre property. The buildings use 100% renewable energy and strategies to minimize the high amount of water needed to keep the machines cool.\nThe data-center complex is poised to become the city's largest contributor to property taxes. It negotiated property tax discounts for the next 20 years, but it will still deliver tens of millions of dollars a year to county coffers until then, according to an economic-impact analysis.\nData centers are in high demand because of increasing digital dependency.\nTennessee Valley Authority officials anticipate a 50% increase in the server farms in Tennessee over the coming decade.\n\"We are looking for companies that were going to contribute more to the tax revenue side than adding lots of jobs,\" Bates said. \"We wanted low job numbers because unemployment is 3% or under. We weren\u2019t necessarily looking for companies that were going to need 300 workers.\"\nThis article originally appeared on Nashville Tennessean: Tennessee's Meta data farm to expand.

To listen to the podcast, click here: \u00a0https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2250736/how-to-create-a-stock-portfolio-that-pays-100-a-month)\nWelcome to Episode #396 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.\n(0:45) - Learning From The Income Investor Portfolio\n(7:30) -\u00a0Why Are Dividends So Important To Your Investing?\n(17:45) - How To Identify A Strong Dividend Paying Company?\n(26:30) - Where Should You Be Looking To Invest For Dividends Stock?\n(44:00) - Episode Roundup: KEY, VICI, META, XOM, LLY, MDC\n Podcast@Zacks.com\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\nThis week, Tracey is joined by Bryan Hayes, Zacks Stock Strategist and editor of the Income Investor newsletter, to talk about how to create a stock portfolio that also generates on average of $100 a month, or $1200 a year.\nIt doesn't sound like much, does it? Just $100 a month. But depending on the yield on each stock, it may take you a bigger investment than you think to get there.\nThis podcast is talking about individual stocks, not dividend paying ETFs. With a diverse set of stocks, it's possible to generate $1200 a year and you may get the benefit of stock appreciation as well.\nTracey and Bryan looked at 5 large cap stocks as larger companies are more likely to pay dividends, and to raise the dividend payout, consistently over time.\nWhere should you look to generate $100 a month, or $1200 a year?\n1. VICI Properties Inc. VICI\nVICI Properties owns 93 experiential properties including 54 gaming properties. It's holdings include sports and wellness including Bowlero, Canyon Ranch, Great Wolf Resorts, Kalahari Resorts, and Homefield. VICI also owns some of the most iconic names on the Las Vegas strip including Caesars Palace Las Vegas, MGM Grand and the Venetian Resort Las Vegas.\nVICI is a REIT and is currently paying an annual dividend of $1.66 per share, which is yielding 5.6%. If you owned only VICI, you would have to buy 722 shares at the cost of $21,267, to generate $1200 a year.\nShould VICI be on the short list for those looking for a REIT?\n2. KeyCorp KEY\nKeyCorp is a regional bank headquartered in Cleveland, OH with a market cap of $14.3 billion. The banks have been battered over the last 2 years. Shares of KeyCorp have dropped about 30% during that time.\nBut is a turnaround coming? KeyCorp is up 6% year-to-date. It pays an annual dividend of $0.82, which is yielding 5.3%.\nIf you only bought KeyCorp, you would need to buy 1463 shares at the cost of $22,375 to generate the $1200 a year.\nIs a bank like KeyCorp a bargain right now?\n3. Meta Platforms META\nIn Feb 2024, Meta Platforms announced its board of directors had authorized a quarterly dividend. This was a first for the social media company. Meta Platforms is now paying an annual dividend of $2.00 a share, which is a yield of just 0.4%.\nWith a yield that low, it will take a lot of firepower to generate $1200 just from owning Meta Platforms. An investor would need 600 shares, at the cost of $296,412, to generate the $1200 payout.\nShould Meta Platforms still be a part of a passive income portfolio even with its low yield?\n4. ExxonMobil Corp. XOM\nExxonMobil is one of the world's largest energy and chemical companies. It is a dividend aristocrat. It has raised its dividend every year for 41 years. ExxonMobil says its annual increase averages 5.8% over those 41 years.\nExxonMobil is currently paying $3.80 for a yield of 3.3%. An investor would need to buy 315 shares for $37,443, to generate $1200 a year in passive income.\nExxonMobil shares are up 18.6% year-to-date. Should energy stocks be in your passive income portfolio?\n5. Eli Lilly and Co. LLY\nEli Lilly is a big pharmaceutical company that is producing a weight loss drug. Investors looking for passive income have historically looked to big pharma companies like Eli Lilly because they tend to pay them. However, Eli Lilly is not a member of the dividend aristocrats, because while it has paid a dividend for many years, from 2009-2014 it did not increase it.\nEli Lilly is paying an annual dividend of $5.20 per share, for a yield of 0.7%. Shares have soared 165% over the last 2 years, pushing the yield down. Investors would have to buy 230 shares, at a cost of $175,346, to generate $1200 a year.\nShould Eli Lilly be part of a passive income portfolio?\nWhat Else Should You Know About Owning Dividend Stocks and Generating $100 a Month? \nTune into this week's video podcast to find out.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nFollow us on Twitter:\u00a0 https://twitter.com/zacksresearch\nJoin us on Facebook:\u00a0 https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/\nZacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com/performance\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "Title": "Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg avoided a cage match with Elon Musk but got a jab in anyway by passing him on the billionaires list",
        "Author": "  Marco Quiroz-Gutierrez ",
        "Text": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk never actually made it into the ring, but Zuckerberg still dealt a blow to the Tesla CEO by surpassing him on the list of the world\u2019s richest people.\nZuckerberg is now the third richest person in the world with a net worth of $171 billion, jumping above No. 4 Musk, who has a net worth of $168 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Meta CEO has gotten tens of billions of dollars richer since the start of the year, according to Bloomberg, in part because of the stellar performance of Meta\u2019s shares.\nAlthough his official salary for a decade has remained steady at $1, Zuckerberg is Meta\u2019s largest and controlling shareholder, with more than 350 million shares, according to the company\u2019s most recent proxy statement. Meta\u2019s shares have skyrocketed about 40% since January, giving Zuckerberg paper gains of about $49 billion on the shares he owns or controls.\nMeanwhile, one of Musk\u2019s main sources of wealth, Tesla stock, is struggling. Shares have plummeted 43% since the start of the year, making it the worst performing company in the S&P 500. Musk owns just over 715 million Tesla shares, according to the company\u2019s most recent proxy statement, and their value dropped by $76 billion since January.\nTesla\u2019s lackluster stock performance comes after the company reported its first year-over-year sales decline since the pandemic earlier this month. Over the weekend, the company also cut the price of several vehicles along with its Full Self-Driving software.\nEven notable Tesla bulls have recently cast doubt on the company\u2019s direction and are expecting answers from Musk on Tuesday\u2019s earnings call.\nBut while Musk\u2019s flagship company backslides, he is still trying to secure a $45 billion pay package, after a judge struck it down in January (when it was worth $56 billion). Musk\u2019s big payday could put him above Zuckerberg by net worth, but it\u2019s unclear whether the package will be approved by shareholders at the company\u2019s proxy meeting in June.\nThe two billionaire executives have been at odds for years. In 2016, Meta contracted SpaceX to launch a satellite that would\u2019ve brought internet access to sub-Saharan Africa. The rocket exploded on the journey, prompting Zuckerberg to write on Facebook that he was \u201cdeeply disappointed.\u201d After Musk bought Twitter (now X), Zuckerberg was quick to launch Threads, a look-alike competitor, which Musk later called \u201ceerily quiet.\u201d\nTheir conflict escalated in June when Musk challenged Zuckerberg in a post on X.\n\u201cI\u2019m up for a cage match if he is lol,\u201d he wrote at the time.\nZuckerberg, who has recently taken an interest in martial arts, seemed to take the challenge seriously and was ready to set up the fight. He later called it off, saying Musk wasn\u2019t serious about getting into the ring.\n\u201cDana White offered to make this a legit competition for charity. Elon won\u2019t confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote on Threads. \u201cIf Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

From healthcare revolutionizing drug discovery and patient care to finance harnessing AI's predictive prowess to manufacturing and optimizing processes with machine learning, AI's disruptive influence cast a broad footprint.\nPer a Grand View Research report, the global artificial intelligence market size is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.3% from 2023 to 2030. It is projected to reach $1,811.8 billion by 2030.\nVarious companies are implementing AI-based solutions such as RPA (Robotic Process Automation) to enhance the process workflows to handle and automate repetitive tasks. AI-based solutions are also being coupled with IoT (Internet of Things) to provide robust results for various business processes.\nThe AI in hardware market is poised for remarkable expansion, projected to swell from $20.88 billion in 2023 to $25.96 billion in 2024, exhibiting an impressive 24.3% CAGR. This trajectory is anticipated to persist, with the market forecast to reach $58.61 billion by 2028, maintaining a robust 22.6% CAGR. Key trends expected to shape this period encompass the accelerated pace of urbanization, further dissemination of internet connectivity, the continued evolution of smart city infrastructures, a rising appetite for self-driving vehicles, and an intensifying need for cloud-based computing capabilities.\nGenerative AI and AI-related startups have attracted close to $50 billion in investments since 2023, affirming the growing interest in the technology and its applications. Microsoft invested close to $13 billion in OpenAI as it sought to gain a front seat in the startup's AI innovations. Anthropic is one of the startups that raised close to $2 billion from investors led by Google as it sought a valuation of close to $30 billion.\nGartner estimates 240 million GenAI smartphones and 54.5 million AI PCs will be shipped worldwide by the end of 2024, representing 22% of all PCs and basic and premium smartphones, respectively. PC shipments are also expected to grow 3.5% in 2024, while smartphone shipments are expected to grow 4.2%.\nAmid the fervent AI boom, shareholders have been hunting for the pioneers and visionaries adept at monetizing AI's capabilities to deliver both ground-breaking innovation and substantial returns.\nHere, we have picked four tech stocks, NVIDIA, Twilio, Meta Platforms and Zscaler, which, apart from boasting strong fundamentals, have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). Per Zacks\u2019 proprietary methodology, stocks with such a perfect mix of elements offer solid investment opportunities. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nNVIDIA is a leader in AI technology, particularly in the development of GPUs used for machine learning and AI applications. With its continuous innovations in AI hardware and software, NVIDIA stands poised to benefit from the growing demand for AI-driven solutions across various sectors, including gaming, data centers, autonomous vehicles, and more. Last week, NVIDIA forged a partnership with Indonesia's telco firm PT Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison to build an artificial intelligence (AI) center in Central Java in 2024.\nNVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell platform promises to power a new era of computing by enabling organizations worldwide to build and deploy real-time generative AI models on an unprecedented scale.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA\u2019s 2024 earnings has moved north by 2.6% to $23.72 per share in the past 60 days, which suggests year-over-year growth of 83.02%.\nTwilio has enhanced its Flex platform with new features like Unified Profiles and Agent Copilot to improve customer support departments by boosting efficiency and productivity. Unified Profiles, powered by Twilio Segment, enables clients to access native data layers for personalized interactions. Agent Copilot uses this data, along with AI, to help employees automate tasks and work more efficiently. The new features will use AI to reduce costs associated with traditional engineering methods for merging and utilizing data.\nThe company has been rapidly expanding in the AI space through partnerships and product launches. Amazon and Twilio collaborated to enhance the latter\u2019s platform with predictive AI technology. The two companies combined Amazon SageMaker technology and Twilio Segment\u2019s Customer Data platform to enable TWLO\u2019s clients to better understand their customers. Twilio, alongside Google Cloud, aimed to incorporate generative AI into its Flex and Customer Engagement platforms.\nTwilio carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. The consensus mark for the company\u2019s 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 11.4% to $2.64 per share over the past 60 days, which indicates a 7.76% increase from 2023.\nZscaler, a pioneer in cloud security, has announced a groundbreaking advancement in AI innovations through its acquisition of Avalor. This move underscores ZS' commitment to fortifying its platform with cutting-edge capabilities. This collaboration empowers enterprises to automate AI-driven analytics and decision-making in real-time, streamlining reporting, incident mitigation and advanced threat detection within the Zscaler cloud security platform.\nZscaler Zero Trust SASE is the industry\u2019s first single-vendor SASE solution, which is built on the company\u2019s Zero Trust AI.

The move signals how Meta plans to tap massive user bases across its various apps to scale its AI offerings.\nMeta unveiled Meta AI, its general-purpose assistant, in late September. The AI chatbot is designed to answer user queries directly within chats, as well as offer them the ability to generate photorealistic images from text prompts. In collaboration with Microsoft, Meta unveiled the next generation of Large Language Model Meta AI (\u201cLlama\u201d), called Llama 2. The social media giant also released Code Llama, a large language model (LLM) that can use text prompts to generate and discuss code. The company confirmed earlier this week that it will be launching Llama 3, the next version of its open-source LLM, within the next month.\nMeta Platforms currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s 2024 earnings has been revised 1.1% upward to $20.03 per share in the past 60 days, which suggests year-over-year growth of 34.7%.\nThe potential growth in the AI sector is substantial, and these companies stand out for their innovative AI solutions, making them compelling choices for investors eyeing the burgeoning AI market in 2024. These companies represent a diverse range of AI applications, from hardware to software, and across various industries. The increasing integration of AI into everyday life, industries, and businesses positions these companies for potential growth in 2024 and beyond.\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Mark Zuckerberg made just $1 salary from Meta in 2023 \u2013 and $24.4M in \u2018other compensation\u2019",
        "Author": "  Shannon Thaler ",
        "Text": "Mark Zuckerberg received the lowest salary of all of Meta\u2019s staff in 2023, with his measly $1 salary \u2014 though the Big Tech chief raked in a staggering $24.4 million in \u201cother compensation.\u201d\nAccording to a proxy filing statement, the lion\u2019s share of this \u201cother compensation\u201d covered Zuckerberg\u2019s security costs.\nThough the Securities and Exchange Commission filing didn\u2019t disclose just how much of the sum was spent on protecting the 39-year-old CEO, it was revealed last year that the Facebook owner boosted its budget for keeping its boss safe to $14 million, up from $10 million in previous years.\nThe 2023 bump, which marked a 40% increase in Zuckerberg\u2019s personal security pre-tax allowance, came during the exec\u2019s so-called \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d when the company laid off 13% of its workforce, or roughly 11,000 employees, as Zuckerberg looked to make Meta \u201cleaner.\u201d\nZuckerberg is allowed to use the money to pay for \u201cadditional personnel, equipment, services, residential improvement\u201d and other safety-related needs, Meta said at the time.\nMeanwhile, the other funds within Zuckerberg\u2019s $24.4 million compensation went to \u201ccosts related to personal usage of private aircraft,\u201d per the filing earlier reported on by Fortune, which also noted that Zuckerberg received $1 in salary \u201cper his request.\u201d\nHe also \u201cdoes not participate in our Bonus Plan nor did he receive any equity awards,\u201d the proxy statement said.\nMeta also included that the median annual compensation among its 67,000-plus employees, excluding Zuckerberg, was an impressive $379,050.\nIn comparison, the average tech worker earns anywhere between $35,000 and $120,000 depending on the role, according to Fortune, citing data from\u00a0Indeed.\nWhen contacted for comment on Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cother compensation,\u201d a Meta spokesperson told The Post: \u201cAs a reminder, Mark and Priscilla have pledged to give away 99% of their Meta shares to charitable purposes over the course of their lifetimes. To date, they have committed more than $6.7 billion through their philanthropy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, to support their goal to help scientists cure, prevent or manage all disease as well as other projects across education and supporting their local communities.\u201d\nDespite making just $11 in salary since 2013, Zuckerberg has seen his wealth balloon by more than $47 billion so far this year.\nAccording to the Bloomberg Billionaire\u2019s Index, Zuckerberg is the third richest person in the world with a net worth of $176 billion \u2014 only trailing behind French luxury fashion tycoon Bernard Arnault and Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, who boast $220 billion and $202 billion, respectively.\nThe Menlo Park, Calif.-based business raked in $134.9 billion in revenue in 2023 due to its popularity among 4 billion-plus monthly users \u2014 some 3 billion of which come from Facebook alone.\nThe majority of Zuckerberg\u2019s lucrative year thus far comes from his roughly 13% stake in Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, according to Bloomberg.\nYear to date, Meta\u2019s share price has also rocketed more than 43%, closing Wednesday at $493.50.\nZuckerberg isn\u2019t the only CEO with the $1 salary:\nTesla\u2019s Elon Musk, Yelp chief Jeremy Stoppelman and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have also made just $1 per year at their respective companies.\nFormer Apple executive Steve Jobs also requested a mere $1 salary during his tenure at the iPhone maker and before his death in 2011.\n"

        "Text": "In-depth polls are conducted regularly across the United States to gauge voters\u2019 main concerns and interests and to predict who is going to win elections.\nPolls often dictate where politicians focus their campaigns to speak to voter\u2019s issues and concerns. They cover sentiment on various issues from immigration to firearm rights and attempt to gauge how various candidates would fare against certain opponents. In the latest Harvard CAPS-Harris poll conducted in late March, voters were surveyed on the most favorable U.S. institutions, and many of the results may seem surprising.\nDon't Miss:\nClick here to see inside the portfolios of top venture capital firms that secretly own everything.\nHere\u2019s why you should never copy the CIA\u2019s venture capital investment strategy.\nThe U.S. military has consistently topped the list of most favored institutions over the years because of its perception as a respectable, selfless and patriotic career. From Veterans Day to Memorial Day, veterans are consistently well-respected and favored on both sides of the political aisle. The U.S. military topping the list is the only institution on the list that isn't controversial. The military is viewed as favorable or highly favorable by 80% of voters, with 11% seeing it as unfavorable.\nIn 2020, many police forces saw their budgets slashed by millions in response to the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Despite the backlash, the police are now the second-most favored institution in the U.S., according to the Harris poll. It's unclear what caused the shift, but 68% of voters see the police in a favorable light.\nOne that might come as a shock to most is Meta Platform Inc.'s Facebook, which comes in at No. 3. Meta has seen no shortage of controversy in recent years, with reports this week that it sold users' private messages to Netflix Inc.\nTrending: On a hunt for a future startup unicorn? Don\u2019t forget Peter Thiel\u2019s startup investing principles.\nThe institutions at the bottom of the list may also come as a bit of a surprise. The Oct. 7 attack on Israel was one of the most gruesome in modern history. Protests throughout the U.S. garnered widespread attention, with many mainstream outlets seemingly showing support for the organization responsible: Hamas. As such, only 13% of voters see the terrorist organization favorably with 66% seeing it as unfavorable.\nConversely, Antifa, the organization largely behind many of the more violent BLM protests in 2020, ranks second lowest on the list of institutions. Only 16% of voters see it favorably with 48% seeing it as unfavorable.\nThe same poll currently has former President Donald Trump leading with the highest overall favorability for political figures among voters and the fifth-highest unfavorably rating behind Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nImmigration and inflation were the two largest priorities among voters.\nRead About Startup Investing:\nCopy and paste Mark Cuban\u2019s startup investment strategy according to his colorful portfolio.\nWhat decision made this 20-year-old a millionaire in 1 year?\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nAPPLE (AAPL): Free Stock Analysis Report\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report\nThis article US Military, The Police And Meta's Facebook Are The 'Most Favored' Institutions In The US While Hamas And Antifa Rank Last originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nOn April 24, 2024, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) released its 8-K filing, detailing a remarkable financial performance for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. The company reported a substantial year-over-year revenue increase of 27%, achieving $36.455 billion, compared to $28.645 billion in the same period last year. This performance not only reflects a robust growth trajectory but also surpasses the analyst's revenue estimate of $36.148 billion for the quarter.\nMeta, the world's largest online social network, continues to expand its influence through platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. With nearly 4 billion monthly active users across its family of apps, Meta's primary revenue comes from advertising, constituting over 90% of its total income. This quarter's financial success was further underscored by a significant increase in net income, which soared by 117% to $12.369 billion from $5.709 billion in Q1 2023, comfortably exceeding the estimated $11.320 billion.\nMeta's operational efficiency is evident in its increased daily active people (DAP), which rose by 7% year-over-year to 3.24 billion in March 2024. Additionally, ad impressions across its apps grew by 20%, and the average price per ad increased by 6%. These metrics not only demonstrate Meta's robust engagement rates but also its effective monetization strategies.\nThe company's income from operations reflected a remarkable improvement, with a 91% increase to $13.818 billion, up from $7.227 billion in the prior year. The operating margin expanded significantly from 25% to 38%, highlighting Meta's enhanced profitability and operational leverage.\nMeta's commitment to innovation and growth is evident in its strategic investments, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI) and the development of the metaverse. The launch of Meta AI with Llama 3 marks a significant step forward in the company's AI initiatives. Despite a 10% reduction in headcount, Meta's focus on streamlining operations and investing in high-potential areas remains clear.\nFor the upcoming quarter, Meta expects total revenue to range between $36.5 billion and $39 billion, considering a 1% headwind from foreign currency impacts. The company also revised its total expense outlook for 2024 to $96-99 billion, up from the previous forecast of $94-99 billion, due to increased infrastructure and legal costs.\nMeta's balance sheet remains robust with $58.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The company's aggressive capital return program continued with $14.64 billion in share repurchases and $1.27 billion in dividend payments. This reflects Meta's strong cash generation capabilities and commitment to returning value to shareholders.\nThe company's capital expenditures for the quarter stood at $6.72 billion, as it continues to invest heavily in infrastructure to support its AI and metaverse initiatives. Looking ahead, Meta plans to further increase its capital expenditures in the range of $35-40 billion for the full year.\nMeta Platforms Inc's impressive first quarter results set a positive tone for 2024. With significant revenue and net income growth, alongside strategic investments in AI and the metaverse, Meta is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the digital landscape. Investors and stakeholders can look forward to continued innovation and growth as the company navigates the dynamic tech environment.\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Meta Platforms Inc for further details.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Judge dismisses Meta shareholder lawsuit claiming that directors' obligations extend beyond company",
        "Author": "  RANDALL CHASE ",
        "Text": "DOVER, Del. (AP) \u2014 A Delaware judge on Tuesday dismissed a shareholder lawsuit asserting novel claims about the roles of corporate leaders and arguing that the loyalties of Meta directors and company founder Mark Zuckerberg should not lie exclusively with the social media giant.\nJames McRitchie, who runs a website focused on corporate governance and shareholder activism, argued that Meta\u2019s directors have breached their duties to the company by putting profits over broader societal and economic interests, including Meta shareholders\u2019 diversified investments in other companies.\nIn a 101-page opinion citing court rulings dating back more than 200 years, decades of law review articles and legal treatises, and even a Sherlock Holmes short story, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster rejected McRitchie\u2019s claims.\nLaster noted that, under the \u201cstandard Delaware formulation\u201d of corporate law, directors of a corporation owe duties to the stockholders as investors in that corporation.\n\u201cThe plaintiff has not made a persuasive case for change,\u201d Laster wrote. \u201cAt most, he has shown that some academics \u2014 primarily from the law and economics school \u2014 have assumed that a diversified-investor model is the norm. He has also shown that some investor advocacy organizations would prefer that model.\u201d\nWhile Delaware law requires corporate directors to act in the best interests of their stockholders, including maximizing the value of their shares, attorneys for McRitchie argued that Delaware courts should recognize a \u201cportfolio theory\u201d of corporate governance that takes into account external factors.\nThey argued, for example, that Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, has prioritized profits while downplaying the detrimental effects of its products on society and the global economy. That, in turn, they said, can negatively affect the investment portfolios of Meta shareholders who also have invested in other companies.\nAmong the \u201cnegative externalities\u201d the lawsuit blamed on Meta\u2019s social media platforms are mental health problems among young Instagram users, online human trafficking, \u201cvaccine hesitancy,\u201d incitements to violence, and \u201celection misinformation.\u201d\n"
