        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) was one of the S&P 500's hottest stocks last year, rising by an impressive 194% in 2023. It bounced back in a big way after a disappointing 2022 when its share price tanked by 64%.\nThe stock still shows no sign of slowing down as it recently hit new 52-week highs. Is Meta Platforms' stock going to generate strong returns yet again this year, or is now the time for investors to consider cashing out?\nInvestors became bearish on Meta Platforms' business in 2022 as a weak ad market resulted in lackluster sales growth for the company. Towards the end of the year, the company struggled to generate any growth at all. But in recent quarters and amid a more favorable outlook for the economy, the business has been rebounding -- in a big way.\nWith revenue growth back above 20%, Meta has convinced investors that it's still a top growth stock to own. One thing that could derail these numbers, however, is if the ad market slows down. In the latest quarter, which ended on Sept. 30, 2023, Meta reported that ad impressions on its family of apps segment (which includes Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook) grew 31% year over year, but the average price per ad declined by 6%.\nThat's a fairly high growth rate in ad impressions and may be unsustainable. Other factors that may have influenced that strong growth include companies moving away from TikTok due to government bans and X (formerly known as Twitter) due to policy changes, and spending their ad money on Facebook and Instagram instead. But that kind of growth may be a bit too optimistic to continue to expect this year, especially if a recession takes place and companies scale back their ad spending.\nDue to Meta's run-up in price over the past year, the stock is now trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 33. That's a high multiple compared with the stock's five-year average, which includes some heavy discounts in 2022.\nOn Wall Street, the consensus analyst price target is about $358 -- slightly below its current price -- indicating that analysts may be worried about how much more upside could be left for Meta's stock this year.\nIf you've made a good profit on Meta Platforms over the past year, now may be a good time to consider selling the stock. At a near $1 trillion valuation, Meta looks overpriced given that its growth rate may be unsustainable; investors are currently paying a steep multiple which prices in a lot of future earnings growth, which is by no means a certainty.\nTo make matters worse, Meta also has a cash-burning metaverse segment, Reality Labs (it incurred operating losses totaling $11.5 billion over the first nine months of 2023), which could be a drag on its bottom line for years to come.\nIf Meta were to maintain a 20% growth rate or better for the long haul, the stock's price could prove to be justifiable. But I'm not optimistic that the company can continue to grow at such a high rate, which is why I believe long-term investors are better off looking elsewhere for good growth stocks to buy.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms Stock Is 328% Off Its 2022 Low. Should Investors Sell?",
        "Author": "  Justin Pope, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Sometimes, investing questions have no perfect answer. Shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), the social media giant that owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, have risen a staggering 328% since late 2022. Do investors who rode most of this exhilarating ride sell and take their profits?\nAt first glance, \"duh\" might be the correct answer. Gaining over 300% would take years in the broader stock market. There's nothing wrong with doing just that. However, there is a strong argument that Meta's stock still has some mojo left. Perhaps it can continue building on its epic run.\nLet's look at the evidence and see if investors have enough in hand to make the right call. There's also an alternative worth considering.\nWhat Meta Platforms has gone through over the past three years is a testament to the power and impact of market sentiment. From 2021 to late 2022, Wall Street began turning sour on the social media giant.\nWhy? CEO Mark Zuckerberg was spending tens of billions of dollars on his new Reality Labs segment. Meanwhile, iOS privacy updates hurt how effectively Meta's ads could work on Apple devices. The stock cratered from nearly $400 per share to under $90.\nAt the time, the news headlines and social media posts were saying things like, \"Mark Zuckerberg doesn't know what he's doing.\" The criticisms were being directed at the same guy who bought Instagram for $1 billion and turned it into something arguably worth more than 100 times that today.\nBut a funny thing happened. Meta began adapting to the iOS changes. Zuckerberg ordered up some cost-cutting to restore Meta's free cash flow and put growth back on track while balancing continued investments in Reality Labs and artificial intelligence (AI).\nJust about every long-term investor is going to face some adversity. Almost no company can grow for decades without some volatility, and maybe even a huge drop. Sometimes, these companies never get it together, but sometimes they do. Those who stick with it are rewarded handsomely.\nThe real takeaway for investors here? Look for broken stocks, not broken companies. Meta's core app business grew its user base through all the turmoil. That intact core cog in the Meta machine made its rebound as simple as Zuckerberg making the company more efficient last year.\nNow that Wall Street has realized that Meta's business isn't broken after all, analysts have returned to expecting roughly 20% annual earnings growth from the stock. Today, Meta trades at a forward P/E of 22, which means its resulting PEG ratio of 1.1 signals the stock is a good value for the growth you might get.\nBased on its fundamentals, the stock is still a good deal despite its share price soaring from $89 to nearly $400 in 15 months.\nIt's natural for people to think that since the stock blasted off, it must be expensive. It's the opposite of thinking a stock is cheap because the price keeps decreasing. Ultimately, it's a company's fundamentals, its underlying business performance, that tell investors whether a stock is attractive.\nIf you bought Meta Platforms in late 2022, you are sitting on substantial investment returns. Do you sell and cash out? Remember, stocks are volatile, so even though Meta's future still looks bright, that doesn't mean the market won't throw in a curveball and mess up your unrealized gains (they're paper profits until you sell).\nSelling some, but not all, of your Meta shares could be the best of both worlds. Suppose your investment grew from $1,000 to over $4,000 over the past 18 months. If you sell half, that's enough to double your money. Even if Meta collapsed and the other half went to zero, you still made out very well.\nLocking in some gains and leaving the rest ensures that you've had a successful investment while leaving room for upside if Meta continues to grow and compound more investment returns.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "Author": "  Nicholas Rossolillo, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "After an epic rally and nearly 200% gains in 2023, it may seem hard to believe that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) had been all but left for dead by Wall Street in 2022. As 2024 gets underway, share prices of the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and the Quest virtual reality (VR) headsets are nearly back to all-time highs set during the pandemic.\nContrary to popular belief, Meta is far more than a social media business, nor is this company solely betting on the metaverse as its future (despite what the corporate name change a couple of years ago might have implied). Meta has a massive global data center network at its core, enabling millions of businesses -- especially small businesses -- to reach audiences. Don't write off the possibility Meta could have yet another great run in 2024.\nMeta is coming off of CEO Mark Zuckerberg's \"year of efficiency\" in which the company vowed to keep expenses in check after a pandemic-era spending spree. More on that in a moment, because one key to Meta stock's continued success in 2024 will be a resurgence in digital ad spending.\nWhen the company reports fourth-quarter 2023 earnings on Feb. 1, expect strong revenue growth to capture the spotlight. Management did forecast revenue to be $36.5 billion to $40 billion, implying as much as a 24% increase over Q4 2022. Meta is still lapping depressed results in 2022 from a falloff in peak-pandemic user activity and resulting digital spending on its apps, as well as the effects of Apple's\u00a0privacy changes reducing Meta's ability to monetize ads on its fellow tech giant's devices.\nAdditionally, other companies involved in the digital advertising ecosystem -- like Adobe\u00a0and Salesforce, both of which help with marketing analytics and ad distribution -- said that Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and holiday shopping in general hit fresh records in the final weeks of 2023. The two software giants reported mid- to high-single-digit percentage increases in online shopper spending versus 2022.\nMeta powers brand marketing for businesses all over the world -- owing to the incredible reach it offers with over 3.1 billion daily active users (as of the third quarter of 2023). Early indicators of strong consumer spending could mean great things for the social media company, which uses its data centers and new artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to help marketers find an audience and realize sales.\nZuckerberg and company have indicated they have been pleased with renewed success in 2023, and that new modes of operating will continue into 2024 and beyond. That means not just revenue growth, but more profitable revenue growth.\nCutting back on expenses, paired with Meta's share repurchase program, have already done wonders. Earnings per share (EPS) in Q3 2023 were $4.39 -- a massive 168% increase from the same quarter in 2022, and a 36% increase over Q3 2021 (the pandemic EPS peak).\nA similar cadence of EPS increases is expected in Q4, and could perhaps continue into the new year. Thus, though Meta has an expensive-looking stock on a backward-looking basis (31 times trailing-12-month EPS, and 25 times trailing-12-month free cash flow), shares could actually be a value on a forward-looking basis (20 times Wall Street analysts' early estimate for 2024 EPS, and 21 times the estimate for 2024 free cash flow).\nIt doesn't look like it's too late to invest in Meta stock for the long term. The business is back on track with a focus on profitable growth, and its data centers and AI are unlocking healthy returns for marketing customers. Meta could be another standout winner in 2024.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "Text": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) saw a significant share price rise of 27% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock\u2019s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let\u2019s take a look at Meta Platforms\u2019s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n View our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nGood news, investors! Meta Platforms is still a bargain right now. According to our valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $501.66, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What\u2019s more interesting is that, Meta Platforms\u2019s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you\u2019re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let\u2019s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Meta Platforms' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 89%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\nAre you a shareholder? Since META is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.\nAre you a potential investor? If you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on META for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn\u2019t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it\u2019s not too late to buy META. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.\nKeep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with META.\nOn February 1, 2024, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) released its 8-K filing, revealing a significant uptick in its financial performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year ended December 31, 2023. The company, known for its expansive social network ecosystem that includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services, has reported a substantial increase in revenue and net income, reflecting the company's focus on operational efficiency and growth in its advertising business.\nMeta's fourth-quarter revenue rose to $40.11 billion, a 25% increase compared to the same period in 2022. This growth was mirrored in the company's full-year revenue, which climbed 16% to $134.90 billion. The impressive revenue figures were bolstered by a 21% year-over-year increase in ad impressions delivered across the Family of Apps and a 2% increase in the average price per ad for Q4.\nNet income for the fourth quarter skyrocketed by 201% to $14.02 billion, while the full-year net income saw a 69% increase to $39.10 billion. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $5.33, up 203%, and $14.87 for the full year, up 73%. These figures reflect Meta's successful cost management strategies, including an 8% decrease in total costs and expenses for the quarter.\nOperational efficiency was a key theme in Meta's latest earnings report. The company's headcount decreased by 22% year-over-year, and it completed several restructuring initiatives, including data center and employee layoffs, as well as facilities consolidation. These measures contributed to the reduction in costs and expenses and were reflected in the company's improved operating margin, which stood at 41% for Q4 and 35% for the full year.\nDespite these achievements, Meta is not without its challenges. The company's CFO outlook commentary highlighted expectations of increased operating losses for Reality Labs, driven by product development efforts in augmented and virtual reality. Additionally, Meta is facing regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S., which could significantly impact its business operations and financial results.\nMeta's balance sheet remains robust, with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $65.40 billion as of December 31, 2023. The company's long-term debt stood at $18.39 billion. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was reported at $11.50 billion, and $43.01 billion for the full year, indicating strong liquidity and financial health.\nThe company also announced a significant return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and the initiation of a quarterly dividend. Meta repurchased $6.32 billion of its Class A common stock in the fourth quarter and $20.03 billion for the full year. Furthermore, the board declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share, marking the company's commitment to delivering shareholder value.\nAs Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) navigates the evolving digital landscape, its focus on AI and the metaverse, along with its operational discipline, positions the company for continued growth. However, investors and stakeholders will be closely monitoring how the company addresses its challenges, particularly in the regulatory space, and how it capitalizes on its opportunities in the coming year.\nFor a detailed analysis of Meta's financial performance and future outlook, investors are encouraged to review the full 8-K filing and stay tuned to GuruFocus.com for the latest financial news and expert insights.\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Meta Platforms Inc for further details.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

Favorable forex is expected to aid year-over-year top-line growth by roughly 2%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $38.93 billion, indicating an increase of 21.02% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s reported figure.The consensus mark for earnings stands at $4.84 per share, which has increased 0.83% over the past 30 days, suggesting growth of 61.33% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.Meta\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 27.5%.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\nLet\u2019s see how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.\nMeta\u2019s fourth-quarter top line is expected to have benefited from Facebook\u2019s expanding user base (more than 3.049 billion daily active users) and growing adoption of reels. Increased engagement for Meta\u2019s offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.Effective usage of AI has been helping the company keep its users engaged. AI-driven feed recommendations have been a key catalyst.Reels have been a major growth driver for Instagram. The company stated that Reels has driven a more than 40% increase in time spent on Instagram since its launch. It remains focused on growing Reels as part of its overall portfolio of video services, which make up more than half of time spent on Facebook and Instagram.Higher engagement levels are helping to steady its user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Asia Pacific Daily Active Users (DAUs) in the fourth quarter is pegged at 906 million, indicating 6.1% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate for the Rest of World is expected to have increased 5.8% to 680 million DAUs.Regarding Monthly Active Users (MAUs), the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Asia Pacific is pegged at 1.361 billion, suggesting 2.9% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for the Rest of World is expected to have risen 3.7% to 1.361 billion MAUs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Meta\u2019s worldwide DAU is pegged at 2.093 billion, indicating 4.7% growth year over year. The consensus estimate for worldwide MAU is pegged at 3.061 billion, indicating a 3.3% year-over-year increase.Nevertheless, Meta\u2019s top line is expected to reflect the negative impact of the challenging macroeconomic environment and high inflation that is anticipated to have kept ad spending budgets under pressure. This is likely to have weighed on ad revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.In the third quarter of 2023, Meta\u2019s ad revenues represented 99.1% of total revenues, which increased 23.5% year over year to $33.64 billion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2023 ad revenues is pegged at $37.88 billion, indicating 21.2% year-over-year growth.\nPer the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms Stock (NASDAQ:META): Don\u2019t Ignore the Election Year Tailwind",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock has experienced remarkable bullish momentum, rising by an impressive 177% in the past year. Despite undergoing such a tremendous rally, I expect sustained positive sentiment, especially with 2024 being an election year. With an anticipated uptick in ad spending this year, Meta, a giant in the advertising space, stands to reap significant benefits. Coupled with my view that shares appear reasonably valued, my outlook on META remains bullish.\nWith Meta surging by more than 174% over the past year, the stock is undeniably enjoying unstoppable momentum. In my view, several factors are powering this momentum, but the benefits from the 2024 elections have not been priced in yet, leaving plenty of room for upside.\nIn particular, I would attribute the ongoing stock price rally to a mix of FOMO and improving margins following last year\u2019s cost-cutting initiatives. However, the stock seems cheap relative to Meta\u2019s future earnings growth estimates. But let\u2019s look at one thing at a time.\nLooking back to October 2022, only a year and a half ago, the sentiment surrounding Meta stock was quite different. At the time, shares dipped below $90 as the company grappled with perceived instability. Mark Zuckerberg was then attempting to justify Meta\u2019s Reality Labs segment, incurring over $10 billion in annual losses, as a reasonable investment. The company\u2019s attention had shifted entirely to the elusive \u201cMetaverse.\u201d And yet, the Metaverse demos at the time looked worse than Wii Sports released in 2006.\nInvestors, myself included, disapproved of this direction. We had a robust platform of lucrative apps, and instead of focusing on monetization, cost efficiency, and returning capital to shareholders, Zuckerberg redirected the ship toward the unknown. Fortunately, Meta\u2019s management swiftly responded to investors\u2019 concerns, gradually becoming quieter on the Metaverse and starting to focus on implementing cost-cutting measures, including a 13% reduction in the workforce in late 2022.\nThis caused a rapid shift from an ultra-bearish sentiment to an ultra-bullish one, leading to Meta\u2019s swift rally. Such a sudden shift in sentiment likely left many investors behind. Thus, I believe the ongoing momentum continues to be propelled by FOMO.\nBut while some may argue that this FOMO may have led to the stock being overvalued, I think otherwise. In fact, shares remain attractively priced considering Meta\u2019s future growth estimates \u2013 especially in the face of upcoming election-related spending. Let\u2019s take a deeper look.\nThe impending U.S. elections should serve as a substantial tailwind for the advertising industry, with industry giants like Meta poised to capitalize significantly. To provide context, in the 2019-2020 election cycle, total political advertising spending reached a staggering $8.5 billion across all mediums, with political digital advertising witnessing a remarkable 4.6x increase from 2018 to 2020.\nResearch stemming from the previous election cycle underscores Facebook\u2019s 12-fold cost-effectiveness compared to TV in less efficient geographical zones. Also, a February 2021 Wesleyan study revealed that over 10 times as many state legislative candidates opted to advertise on Facebook than on television, primarily attributing this choice to the cost-advantaged tradeoff.\nWith politicians increasingly convinced of the effectiveness of digital ad spend, the current election cycle is poised to lead to a substantial surge in political ad spending.\nReuters reports a projected 30% increase in political ad spending in the U.S. this year compared to the last presidential election in 2020, primarily driven by higher expenditures on digital platforms. While TV remains the dominant recipient of ad spending, digital platforms are expected to see the most significant growth in political ads, with revenues forecasted to surge by 156% from 2020 to $3.46 billion in 2024.\nWall Street analysts seem to be catching up to this reality. Last year, the market anticipated Meta to achieve revenues of approximately $137 billion in Fiscal 2024. This figure has since risen to nearly $151 billion, and given the ongoing trajectory of earnings estimate revisions, there is a strong likelihood that this figure will continue to ascend.\nIn the interim, consensus estimates suggest that Meta will post EPS of $17.43 next year. Notably, Wall Street estimates have historically been conservative, with Meta often exceeding expectations by a wide margin. Even if we adopt Wall Street\u2019s estimate, though, Meta\u2019s current valuation stands at a modest 21 times next year\u2019s EPS.\nI believe that this forward P/E is cheap, given the company\u2019s substantial market dominance, consistent double-digit growth, and management\u2019s strategic focus on bolstering profits. Consequently, in spite of Meta\u2019s considerable rally in recent quarters, the combination of relatively subdued forward estimates and a soft valuation should continue to support the ongoing positive momentum.\nRegarding Wall Street\u2019s sentiment on the stock, Meta Platforms retains a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 36 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. At $397.31, the\u00a0average META stock price target suggests 8.1% upside potential.\nIf you\u2019re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell META stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0Brad Erickson from RBC Capital, with an average return of 58.54% per rating and a 76% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\nMeta Platforms\u2019 crazy surge in the past year reflects its invincible momentum driven by factors like FOMO and improving margins. However, as the 2024 election year approaches, the anticipated uptick in political ad spending positions Meta for further gains.\nReflecting on Meta\u2019s transformative journey from a Metaverse-centric focus to a profit-driven strategy, the current valuation also appears attractive. With a notable increase in political ad spending that only gradually appears priced in by Wall Street estimates, Meta\u2019s ongoing positive momentum seems poised for sustained growth.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "The share price of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has undergone significant volatility, as evidenced by its dramatic fluctuations. In September 2021, the share price stood at $379 per share, but by October 2022, it had plummeted to nearly $92. However, there has been a robust recovery since then, with the price settling around $358 per share at the time of writing. This remarkable turnaround has resulted in year-to-date gains of 180% for Meta. Let's take a closer look to determine whether the stock is attractive to investors at the current price.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with META.\nMeta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, underwent a significant rebranding in October 2021. The company's original core application, Facebook, was a primary driver of user engagement, revenue and profitability. The rebranding to Meta, which hints at the concept of the \"Metaverse,\" reflects the company's future direction. With a mission \"to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together,\" the social meadia giant aims to make the metaverse a reality through its diverse product offerings. The company operates through two main business segments: the Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).\nIn 2022, the FoA segment, which includes popular apps like Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, was a major revenue generator. It brought in nearly $114.5 billion, accounting for 98.2% of Meta's total revenue. This segment primarily earns through selling advertising placements to marketers. On the other hand, the RL segment, focused on virtual and augmented reality technologies, contributed significantly less, with revenue of only $2.16 billion, less than 2% of the total sales.\nThe FoA segment is highly profitable, generating $42.66 billion in operating income with an impressive operating margin of 37%. In contrast, the RL segment recorded $13.7 billion in losses. Meta has been leveraging the profitability of the FoA segment to support and develop the RL segment, aligning with its broader vision for the metaverse.\nOver the past decade, Meta has demonstrated consistently high revenue growth. In 2012, its revenue stood at $5 billion, soaring to nearly $118 billion by 2021, before slightly declining to $116.6 billion in 2022. The annual growth rate between 2012 and 2021 varied from 21.6% to 58.4%. However, in 2022, there was a 1.1% decrease in sales, partly attributed to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar. Nonetheless, on a constant currency basis, sales growth was 4% in 2022. This slowdown in sales growth mainly resulted from a global reduction in advertising spending, influenced by a sluggish global economy and rising interest rates. Additionally, challenges arose from Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) \"app tracking transparency\" feature, which allows users to prevent apps from tracking their activities across devices.\nIn 2022, Meta's operating income plummeted by 38% to nearly $29 billion. This significant drop was not only due to sluggish sales growth, but also an increase in payroll and expenses related to a 20% increase in employee headcount.\nSince late 2022 and into early 2023, Meta initiated restructuring efforts to enhance its operating performance. This involved three rounds of restructuring and layoffs, particularly in recruiting and technical departments, resulting in over 20,000 job cuts. By the second quarter of 2023, Meta's workforce had been reduced to approximately 66,100 employees, a 7% decrease from the previous quarter. The 2022 restructuring led to a leaner organization and improved operating margins. Meta also leveraged artificial intelligence to boost product and business performance. AI-driven feed recommendations significantly increased user engagement, leading to a 7% rise in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram. Furthermore, Meta's Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns achieved a $10 billion run rate, with over 50% of advertisers utilizing the Advantage+Creative tool for ad optimization.\nAs a result of these restructuring efforts and initiatives, Meta's financial performance in the first three quarters of 2023 improved significantly. Revenue grew by 23% to $34.15 billion and operating profit surged by 145% to $13.75 billion. Consequently, the operating margin expanded remarkably from nearly 19.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 40.36% in the third quarter of 2023.\nMeta possesses a robust balance sheet, characterized by effective leverage management. As of September, the company held approximately $36.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, along with $24.2 billion in marketable securities, including U.S. government and corporate debt instruments. Its long-term debt was relatively modest at $18.4 billion. This debt comprises fixed-rate senior unsecured notes, issued in August 2022 and May 2023, at favorable interest rates. The interest rates on these notesvaried from 3.50% to 5.75%. Furthermore, the maturity dates of these debts are spread out, ranging from 2027 to as far out as 2063. The principal payments for these debts are staggered, each ranging from $1 billion to a maximum of $3 billion.\nOver the last 10 years, Meta has consistently increased its earnings per share, starting from a mere 1 cents in 2012, escalating to a peak of $13.77 in 2021 and then settling at $8.59 in 2022. Following its recent restructuring and the implementation of AI-driven initiatives, which have significantly improved its operating margin, the company is projected to achieve increased revenue and earnings per share in 2024. For 2024, it is estimated that Meta will generate approximately $150.7 billion in revenue and earnings of $17.39 per share. Over the last five years, Meta's price-earnings ratio has fluctuated between 8.65 and 37.90. Using the five-year average price-earnings ratio of 25.50, the estimated value of Meta's shares is around $443, which is nearly 24% higher than its current trading price.\nMeta Platforms' financial journey is a testament to resilience and strategic foresight in a volatile market. Despite the challenges posed by global economic shifts and technological disruptions, the company's effective restructuring, particularly in 2023, and its commitment to innovation have catalyzed a significant turnaround. The company has a strong balance sheet, a focused approach to debt management and promising projections for revenue and earnings growth. The current market valuation of Meta's stock, while robust, suggests it is undervalued.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Title": "Mark Zuckerberg explained how Meta will crush Google and Microsoft at AI\u2014and Meta warned it could cost more than $30 billion a year",
        "Author": "  Alexandra Sternlicht ",
        "Text": "Mark Zuckerberg laid out Meta's gameplan for \"playing to win\" against Alphabet and Microsoft in the high-stakes AI arms race. Meta's secret weapon: its walled garden of data.\n\"There are hundreds of billions of publicly shared images and tens of billions of public videos, which we estimate is greater than the common crawl data set,\u201d Zuckerberg said on Meta\u2019s earnings call on Thursday. It was a not-so-subtle jab at competitors Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, which are training their AI models on the public web data crawled by their search engines every day.\nBeyond the generative AI technology that Meta already offers in its battle against the other Big Tech powers (including Apple, which teased on its earnings call Thursday that it would launch a generative AI product later this year), Zuckerberg is aiming for \u201cgeneral intelligence,\u201d the still unproven concept of a general purpose AI that can handle most tasks better than humans.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be building the most popular and advanced AI products and services. If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done,\u201d Zuckerberg said, even as his management team hinted at the hefty price tag of carrying out the project. Meta\u2019s capital expenditures could increase by as much as $9 billion this year, totalling between $30 billion to $37 billion, compared to $28.1 billion in 2023.\nAnd the company suggested this could be the new normal, noting that \u201cwe expect our ambitious long-term AI research and product development efforts will require growing infrastructure investments beyond this year.\u201d\nIt\u2019s probably no coincidence that Meta announced its first ever cash dividend to investors on Thursday. The new, 50-cent quarterly dividend, along with strong results in Meta\u2019s core advertising business, ignited Meta\u2019s stock, which shot up 14.5% in after hours trading.\nZuckerberg initially unveiled his vision for artificial general intelligence last month in an Instagram Reels video. On Thursday, he expanded on the plan, describing it as not just a far-off science project, but an effort that will incorporate AGI into Meta products like Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp.\n\u201cIt's clear that we're going to need our models to be able to reason, plan code, remember, and many other cognitive abilities in order to provide the best versions of the services that we envision,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing to win here, and I expect us to continue investing aggressively in this area.\u201d\nTo realize his vision of Meta as the AI leader, Zuckerberg has yet to expand on how exactly Meta user activity will be used as training data for Meta\u2019s AI, and how the company will navigate the potential issues around user privacy.\nAnd it remains to be seen whether Zuckerberg\u2019s confidence in the value of Meta\u2019s training data compared to the vast corpus of web data used by Google is as big of an advantage as he believes. Google has the data treasure trove of YouTube, Google Office and its search engine. Still, Google AI is close-sourced so can only move as fast as engineering talent, whereas Zuckerberg pointed to his company\u2019s open source Llama model as another key advantage.\nEarnings aside, this has been a big week for Meta\u2019s head honcho. Yesterday Zuckerberg was skewered during a U.S. Senate hearing where he, most notably, stood up and apologized to families whose children died from harms inflicted by social media. (Though he did not agree to compensate the families for the harms they suffered at Senator Hawley\u2019s request.)\nWhile the apology may have been wrenching for Zuckerberg, his net worth rose by $1.6 billion (per Forbes) on Thursday with Meta\u2019s stock performance.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of September 2023 Meta Platforms had US$18.4b of debt, an increase on US$9.92b, over one year. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$61.1b in cash, so it actually has US$42.7b net cash.\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Meta Platforms had liabilities of US$30.5b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$42.9b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$61.1b in cash and US$12.9b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its total liabilities are just about perfectly matched by its shorter-term, liquid assets.\nHaving regard to Meta Platforms' size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$989.9b company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Simply put, the fact that Meta Platforms has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.\nAlso positive, Meta Platforms grew its EBIT by 24% in the last year, and that should make it easier to pay down debt, going forward. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Meta Platforms's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. While Meta Platforms has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the most recent three years, Meta Platforms recorded free cash flow worth 79% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Meta Platforms has US$42.7b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$38b, being 79% of its EBIT. So we don't think Meta Platforms's use of debt is risky. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Meta Platforms , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

This impressive rally came on the heels of an almost 170% jump in the past year, signaling investors' satisfaction with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's cost-cutting efforts in 2023, which led to the elimination of over 20,000 jobs.\nAfter a disastrous 2022 that saw Meta's stock plunge by 64% to its lowest point since 2016, CEO Mark Zuckerberg presented 2023 as a \"year of efficiency,\" as quoted on CNBC. His strategic initiatives seem to have paid off, contributing to the remarkable recovery in the company's stock price.\nThis has put focus on Meta-heavy ETFs like Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund XLC, Fidelity MSCI Communication Services Index ETF FCOM, Vanguard Communication Services ETF VOX and iShares Global Comm Services ETF IXP. These ETFs put about 20%-25% focus on Meta stock.\nWhile Meta's share price has reached a new high, its market capitalization remains below its peak in September 2021, which was near $1.1 trillion. This disparity is due to the company's substantial share buybacks, which have reduced the number of outstanding shares. The current market cap is still below $1 trillion.\nInvestors are increasingly bullish on Meta's position in the thriving artificial intelligence market. Mark Zuckerberg recently hinted at the company's ambitious plans by stating that Meta will acquire 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics cards by the end of the year, along with \"almost 600k H100 equivalents of compute\" when considering other GPUs. This significant investment underscores Meta's commitment to advancing its AI ambitions.\nMeta is set to report its fourth-quarter earnings on February 1. Meta has an Earnings ESP of +1.46% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

It delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 27.50% with earnings beat noticed in every quarter.\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 38 analysts, the average price target for Meta Platforms comes to $392.68. The forecasts range from a low of $285.00 to a high of $470.00. The average price target represents an increase of 4.4% from the last closing price of $376.13.\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.30 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 43 brokerage firms.

It also announced it had authorized an additional $50 billion in share repurchases.\nThe social media giant is the first of its generation of internet juggernauts to issue a dividend, a milestone for a tech sector that has been dominated by the same handful of companies for well over a decade.\nFounded in a college dorm room in 2004, it has grown into the world's biggest social media company, connecting more than 3 billion people and revolutionizing how they discover trends, communicate with their neighbors and engage with politics.\nThe company, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, has also been accused of ignoring a multitude of harms on its path to growth, including violations of user privacy and incitements to violence.\nJust a day before announcing results, CEO Mark Zuckerberg was called to testify before the U.S. Senate about child safety online and compelled to apologize to parents of children who had experienced sexual abuses.\n\"You're never as good as they say when you're up, or as bad as they say when you're down. Just keep building and doing good work over long periods of time,\" he said on Thursday in a post on another Meta-owned app, Threads.\nIMPRESSIVE QUARTER\nShares of Meta have steadily been climbing back this past year from a meltdown in 2022 that wiped out more than three-quarters of their one-time value, buoyed by investor excitement about artificial intelligence.\nIts recovery has also been aided by a rebound in user growth and digital ad sales, as well as an austerity drive that saw it shed more than 21,000 employees since late 2022.\nRevenue for the fourth quarter rose 25% to $40.1 billion, above the $39.2 billion analysts were expecting, according to LSEG data.\nNet income rose more than 200% to $14 billion, or $5.33 per share, exceeding expectations of $4.97 per share, according to LSEG data.\n\"This was one of the most impressive quarters \u2013 intrinsically and vs. expectations,\" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney.\nMeta forecast first quarter revenue of $34.5 billion to $37 billion, above Wall Street expectations of $33.8 billion. It said it expects full-year 2024 total expenses to be unchanged at $94 billion to $99 billion.\nThose results came after fellow digital ads heavyweight Alphabet posted holiday season advertising sales that came in below expectations.\nMORE METAVERSE, AI INVESTMENTS\nImprovements to the social media business have made investors more tolerant of Meta's undiminished spending, as it pours billions of dollars into \"metaverse\" technologies and building out its artificial intelligence infrastructure.\nOn Thursday executives doubled down on aggressive investments in both areas.\nThe company's metaversee-oriented Reality Labs unit handily beat revenue expectations for the fourth quarter, posting record sales of $1.1 billion from \"strong sales\" of its Quest device over the holiday season, Zuckerberg told analysts after the report. Investors had been expecting $804 million, according to LSEG data.\nMeta said it still expected operating losses for Reality Labs to \"increase meaningfully\" as it invests more in augmented and virtual reality in 2024.\nWhile interactive and immersive experiences via those technologies remain the ultimate goal, Zuckerberg said the latest version of its Ray-Ban smart glasses, with a built-in AI assistant, has been an early surprise hit with consumers too.\n\"We thought we would have to build full displays and holograms\" before the smart glasses would become mainstream, he said. \"And now it's quite possible that ... AI assistants built in will be the killer app.\"\nStill, though improving, Reality Labs sales remain a tiny 2.7% slice of the company's total revenue.\n\"Meta ended 2023 on an extremely strong note, with revenue soaring above analyst expectations,\" said Debra Aho Williamson, an independent tech analyst and former principal analyst at eMarketer.\n\"The company can talk all it wants to about AI and the metaverse, but it's still a social media company that gets nearly all its revenue from advertising, and advertisers still clearly love Meta.\"\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York and Yuvraj Malik in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Sheila Dang in Austin and Noel Randewich in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Stephen Coates)\n"

        "Text": "By Katie Paul, Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n(Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms plans to deploy into its data centers this year a new version of a custom chip aimed at supporting its artificial intelligence (AI) push, according to an internal company document seen by Reuters on Thursday.\nThe chip, a second generation of an in-house silicon line Meta announced last year, could help to reduce Meta's dependence on the Nvidia chips that dominate the market and control the spiraling costs associated with running AI workloads as it races to launch AI products.\nThe world's biggest social media company has been scrambling to boost its computing capacity for the power-hungry generative AI products it is pushing into apps Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp and hardware devices like its Ray-Ban smartglasses, spending billions of dollars to amass arsenals of specialized chips and reconfigure data centers to accommodate them.\nAt the scale at which Meta operates, a successful deployment of its own chip could potentially shave off hundreds of millions of dollars in annual energy costs and billions in chip purchasing costs, according to Dylan Patel, founder of the silicon research group SemiAnalysis.\nThe chips, infrastructure and energy required to run AI applications has become a giant sinkhole of investment for tech companies, to some degree offsetting gains made in the rush of excitement around the technology.\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed the plan to put the updated chip into production in 2024, saying it would work in coordination with the hundreds of thousands of off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs) - the go-to chips for AI - the company was buying.\n\"We see our internally developed accelerators to be highly complementary to commercially available GPUs in delivering the optimal mix of performance and efficiency on Meta-specific workloads,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last month said the company planned to have by the end of the year roughly 350,000 flagship \"H100\" processors from Nvidia, which produces the most sought-after GPUs used for AI. Combined with other suppliers, Meta would accumulate the equivalent compute capacity of 600,000 H100s in total, he said.\nThe deployment of its own chip as part of that plan is a positive turn for Meta's in-house AI silicon project, after a decision by executives in 2022 to pull the plug on the chip's first iteration.\nThe company instead opted to buy billions of dollars worth of Nvidia's GPUs, which have a near monopoly on an AI process called training that involves feeding enormous data sets into models to teach them how to perform tasks.\nThe new chip, referred to internally as \"Artemis,\" like its predecessor can perform only a process known as inference in which the models are called on to use their algorithms to make ranking judgments and generate responses to user prompts.\nReuters last year reported that Meta is also working on a more ambitious chip that, like GPUs, would be capable of performing both training and inference.\nThe Menlo Park, California-based company shared details about the first generation of its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) program last year. The announcement portrayed that version of the chip as a learning opportunity.\nDespite those early stumbles, an inference chip could be considerably more efficient at crunching Meta's recommendation models than the energy thirsty Nvidia processors, according to Patel.\n\"There is a lot of money and power being spent that could be saved,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York and Stephen Nellis and Max A.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. announced plans to buy back an additional $50 billion in shares and issue its first-ever quarterly dividend as Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg works to convince investors that his costly bets on the metaverse and artificial intelligence will pay off.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nTrump Denied Immunity in DC Election Case by Appeals Court\nXi to Discuss China Stocks With Regulators as Rescue Bets Build\nWall Street Snubs China for India in a Historic Markets Shift\n\u2018Money Dysmorphia\u2019 Traps Millennials and Gen Zers\nKing Charles Treated for Cancer in New Royal Health Scare\nThe social media giant also reported strong fourth-quarter results, posting a 25% gain in sales and profits that tripled, while also projecting revenue growth for the current period that surpassed projections.\nThe shares jumped more than 14% in extended trading. The stock had gained 12% this year through Thursday\u2019s close after nearly tripling last year.\n\u201cWe had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.\u201d\nRevenue is expected to be as much as $37 billion in the three months ending in March, Meta said. Analysts were looking for $33.6 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $40.1 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $39 billion. Net income surged to $14 billion, or $5.33 a share, also better than expected.\nMeta executives had cautioned in October that \u201cglobal economic uncertainties\u201d could weigh on revenue at the end of last year, typically the most lucrative quarter, even as the company laid out an expensive spending plan for 2024. But the social media company, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, fared better than Alphabet Inc. The Google parent, which, like Meta, gets the bulk of its revenue from digital advertising and is also investing heavily on AI, reported softness in its core search advertising business earlier this week, sending its stock tumbling.\n\u201cIn the digital advertising sphere, Meta\u2019s outlook is increasingly optimistic,\u201d said Mayuranki De, research analyst at Global X. \u201cDespite diversifying into areas like virtual-reality headsets, digital advertising remains its revenue cornerstone.\u201d\nChief Financial Officer Susan Li said the strong increase in revenue in the fourth quarter was due to high spending by China-based advertisers and AI-recommended video content. Daily watch time across the company\u2019s apps increased 25% from a year earlier.\nIn 2023, revenue from China-based advertisers represented 10% of Meta\u2019s total revenue and contributed 5 percentage points to total worldwide revenue growth, Li said on a call with analysts.\nIn recent years, Meta has been working to balance huge outlays on technologies like artificial intelligence and virtual reality, while still trying to ensure that its core digital advertising business is still growing. After seeing business shrink for the first time in 2022, Zuckerberg made efforts to turn the company around, dubbing 2023 the \u201cyear of efficiency\u201d and cutting thousands of jobs.\n\u201cThe fruits of their cost cutting measures are starting really to shine through earnings,\u201d analysts at Vital Knowledge wrote in a note.\nZuckerberg struggled to get investors on board the last time he laid out a long-term, expensive new vision \u2014 for the metaverse \u2014 going so far as to change the company\u2019s name from Facebook to Meta. Now, as the company spends handily on VR and AI, the company is sweetening the bet for shareholders with a quarterly dividend of 50 cents a share and a huge share repurchase program. The last time Meta authorized a buyback of this size was in October 2021 when it was still posting surprising growth in the number of people actively using its network of social media apps.\nNow that Meta plans to pay a dividend, the only holdouts among peers valued at more than $1 trillion are Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. Apple Inc. has paid dividends on and off since 1987, and Microsoft Corp. started doling out dividends in 2003.\nMeta\u2019s move sends a signal about the company\u2019s view of its potential. While it indicates management are bullish about growth prospects, it also hints at limits on what the company can do with its cash pile. Typically, faster growing tech companies eschew dividends in favor of using earnings to develop new products or make big acquisitions. While Meta is spending big on artificial intelligence initiatives, its acquisition prospects are dwindling in the face of regulatory opposition.\nMeta has been investing in AI technology at record levels, including expanding its core advertising business through improvements in ad targeting and AI-recommended content, and the infrastructure it needs to run it. At the same time, it hasn\u2019t abandoned efforts to build the virtual reality metaverse.\nFor this year, Meta plans to spend $94 billion to $99 billion, covering higher infrastructure-related costs, hiring selectively in higher-cost technical roles and development in augmented and virtual reality. Last quarter, the company said it planned to push some spending on items like new headcount and infrastructure into 2024.\nZuckerberg said he\u2019s developed an appreciation for operating a leaner company, and is reluctant to jump back into significant hiring. He said he\u2019d like to keep new hires \u201crelatively minimal\u201d to stay lean.\nThe company also said it expects operating losses to \u201cincrease meaningfully\u201d at Reality Labs, the division that makes smart glasses and headsets, as it continues to invest in product development. On the bright side, the unit crossed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time.\nMeta\u2019s results follow reports from other Big Tech rivals, including Microsoft Corp., which failed to convince Wall Street that the all-consuming and expensive focus on AI is starting to pay off yet.\nMeta\u2019s approach to the AI race has been different than its peers, however. For the most part, it\u2019s unveiling research or large language models \u2014 the technology that underpins AI chatbots \u2014 for free to be used by developers. Meta thinks this open strategy will help improve the technology faster.\nFor all of Meta\u2019s excitement about AI, investors focus on the number of people who use its apps has faded. Now with almost 4 billion people across Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp that use the platform each month, the San Francisco-based company said it will no longer report that metric in earnings, or daily and monthly user numbers for its flagship Facebook app.\nBeginning this quarter, the company will instead begin reporting year-over-year changes in ad impressions and the average price per ad at the regional level, while continuing to report only daily active users across its family of apps.\nReels \u2013 the vertical videos on Instagram and Facebook that are served up to users by an algorithm \u2013 are being re-shared 3.5 billion times a day, Zuckerberg said, and ads for that format are now contributing to net revenue across both apps. Continuing to improve those videos, the ads served there and the algorithm that personalizes them for users, will continue to \u201cremain a priority,\u201d he said\n--With assistance from Kurt Wagner.\n(Updates to add user numbers, comments from CFO, CEO)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong\nThe Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

Its services business, which includes its App Store and software such as Apple Music and Apple Pay, grew by 11pc. Sales of the iPad fell while those of Mac computers rose slightly. Sales of accessories such as AirPods and the Apple Watch also declined.\nChief executive Tim Cook said 2.2bn Apple products were now in use around the world\nThe figures come as Apple prepares to release its Vision Pro headset, the most significant new product released in Mr Cook\u2019s 13 years in charge of the company, which goes on sale on Friday in the US.\nAmazon recorded its highest profit for two years amid a jump in trading over the Christmas period.\nThe company said sales rose by 14pc to $170bn in the fourth quarter of the year, in part due to growing sales outside the US.\nProfits rose from $300m a year ago to $10.6bn. This was its strongest profit since the end of 2021, when rising Covid cases meant most consumers resorted to internet shopping.\nThe growth in sales puts Amazon within touching distance of overtaking Walmart as the world\u2019s biggest retail company by revenues.\nShares rose by 6pc in after-hours trading.\nThe results for the Silicon Valley giants came as job cuts continued to hit the industry.

        "Title": "Will Eli Lilly Be Worth More Than Meta Platforms by 2030?",
        "Author": "  Prosper Junior Bakiny, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) don't seem to have much in common as they operate entirely different businesses in completely different industries. The former is a leader in the biotech industry, while the latter is a social media specialist. Here is another difference between the two: Meta Platforms once managed to achieve a feat that Eli Lilly hasn't, and that sometimes makes it a benchmark in the eyes of many investors. Back in 2021, the technology giant became a trillion-dollar company.\nWhile Meta no longer holds that title, with a market capitalization of $962 billion, it should soon rejoin this exclusive clique. Eli Lilly is more than halfway through this goal, with a current market cap of about $610 billion. The drugmaker has generated much stronger returns than Meta Platforms in the past decade, and if the trend continues, Eli Lilly could overtake Meta Platforms soon enough. Could that happen by 2030? Let's find out.\nLLY data by YCharts.\nNotice that Meta Platforms was outpacing Eli Lilly for much of the past decade until about 2022 when the latter skyrocketed. What happened then? Meta Platforms' stock soared during the early months of the pandemic but subsequently fell as that tailwind ended. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly has been on a roll since 2022 with significant clinical and regulatory developments that should help drive strong financial results through the end of the decade and beyond.\nMost notably, Eli Lilly earned approval for an innovative diabetes medicine called Mounjaro in 2022. Last year, it earned a key label expansion in targeting obesity with the drug marketed as Zepbound. Some analysts have predicted peak annual sales of $25 billion for this compound, which would be amazing. Even Humira, the best-selling drug in the history of the industry, peaked at $21.2 billion in yearly sales.\nMounjaro is just one piece of the puzzle for Eli Lilly, although it's a hugely important one. The company is adding several other important medicines to its lineup that should also be successful. For instance, the company's new ulcerative colitis medicine Omvoh could generate sales of $1.2 billion by 2029, while Jaypirca, a new cancer drug, could hit more than $2.5 billion by 2030.\nThen there is donanemab, a potential Alzheimer's disease therapy. Eli Lilly is waiting for approval for this product, and if it does earn the green light, the research company Evaluate Pharma thinks it could rack up $2.1 billion in sales by 2028. There are other key products in Eli Lilly's late-stage pipeline, including a potential once-weekly insulin option. Furthermore, the company's existing lineup features medicines whose sales are still growing at a good clip, from cancer drug Verzenio to immunosuppressant Taltz.\nUnless something catastrophic happens, Eli Lilly should outperform the market through 2030, especially as analysts see the company's earnings per share growing by an average of 28.7% for the next five years -- an almost outrageous pace for a biotech giant.\nMeta Platforms was able to bounce back in 2023. The company benefited from a recovering advertising market while it continued to ramp up monetization of newer initiates across its portfolio of websites and apps. On WhatsApp, the company is working on paid messaging, while its short-form videos on Facebook and Instagram are helping keep users glued to their screens and attracting advertisers. These are important long-term opportunities. Furthermore, the tech company is also looking to make a splash in artificial intelligence.\nIn my view, Meta Platforms is also well-positioned to outperform the market through 2030, although it will be more susceptible than Eli Lilly to several risks, including economic challenges, as we saw in much of 2021 and 2022.\nAt its current valuation, Eli Lilly will need a compound annual growth rate of about 8.6% to become a trillion-dollar stock in six years. That shouldn't be a problem for the company. Far from it. However, Meta Platforms will almost certainly rejoin this rank much sooner. While Eli Lilly will, in my view, outperform Meta Platforms through 2030, whether it can do so enough to end up with a larger market cap is another question. That seems somewhat unlikely, at least to me.\nMeta Platforms' poor performance in 2021 and 2022, which allowed Eli Lilly to soar past it, won't become a habit moving forward, nor should investors expect the biotech giant to deliver the kinds of returns it did during these past two years regularly. Still, Eli Lilly remains a solid buy, as does Meta Platforms.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Eli Lilly wasn't one of them.

(the \"Company\" or \"META\") (NASDAQ:MMAT), an advanced materials and nanotechnology company, today announced preliminary results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, total revenue was approximately $2.2 million, up 55% compared to $1.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and modestly higher compared to the third quarter of 2023.\nThe Company is focused on driving revenue growth in 2024 across four main business lines. In authentication, META has launched two new products, QUANTUM stripe for currency and NANO protect for brand protection, along with continued work for our confidential G10 central bank customer. Following presentations at the Dubai Air Show in November 2023, META is working on multiple pre-orders for the VLEPSIS multi-gigapixel wide area motion imagery system. The Company's NANOWEB transparent conductive films are manufactured in collaboration with Panasonic Industry. Automotive heating films to protect camera, radar and lidar sensors are being tested by leading automotive OEMs and suppliers. NANOWEB EMI shielding films for microwave and combination microwave-convection ovens are also in advanced stages of testing. META is also pursuing joint development and licensing opportunities with global battery OEMs for our NPORE nanoceramic battery separators and NCORE polymer metal composite current collectors.\n\"Over the past three months, we restructured the business and expanded the pipeline for sales and partnerships within four dedicated product lines, bolstered by aggressive marketing efforts. Results have already proven promising, and we are redoubling our efforts in 2024 to commercialize key products, license technology and grow revenues significantly compared to 2023,\" noted Uzi Sasson, META's President and Chief Executive Officer.\nTotal fourth quarter operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $16.1 million (including $1.6 million in restructuring expenses, $3.4 million in depreciation and amortization, and $0.5 million in stock-based compensation), down 35% from the $24.8 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2022, resulting in the estimated fourth quarter 2023 loss from operations of approximately $14.9 million, well below the comparable fourth quarter 2022 operating loss of $24.0 million. An expected non-cash impairment of long-term assets, not included in the figures above, is still to be determined. As of December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $10.3 million, compared to $10.2 million at September 30, 2023.\n\"A strong capital position involves reducing expenses, managing cash and seeking out opportunities to monetize non-core assets to our advantage. We are doing so by extracting value from certain intellectual property and patents related to our medical and holography applications, and in addition working with potential strategic partners to expand our product offerings. We have identified multiple potential interested parties and intend to work cooperatively with investment bankers to divest the assets at the best valuation,\" noted Mr. Sasson.\nMETA expects to release fourth quarter and full year 2023 results in mid-to-late March.

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. director and former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said she will step down from the board this year, exiting her last official role at the social media company she helped grow from a promising internet startup into a digital-advertising stalwart.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nChina Weighs Stock Market Rescue Package Backed by $278 Billion\nIndia Tops Hong Kong as World\u2019s Fourth-Largest Stock Market\nFlorida Governor DeSantis Drops Out of 2024 Race, Endorses Trump\nHong Kong Stocks at 36% Discount Show True Depth of China Gloom\nMorgan Stanley, JPMorgan Say Buy the Dip After Treasury Rout\n\u201cWith a heart filled with gratitude and a mind filled with memories, I let the Meta board know that I will not stand for reelection this May,\u201d Sandberg wrote Wednesday in a post on Meta\u2019s flagship Facebook network. \u201cGoing forward, I will serve as an adviser to the company, and I will always be there to help the Meta teams.\u201d\nSandberg, 54, joined Facebook in 2008 as No. 2 to co-founder Mark Zuckerberg to oversee the fledgling company\u2019s advertising, partnerships, business development and operations, following stints at Google, McKinsey & Co. and the US Department of the Treasury. She left her job as COO of the company, by then rebranded as Meta, in 2022.\nDuring her time at the tech giant, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, Sandberg was key to turning the social network into a money-making machine and one of the world\u2019s biggest companies. In 2022 Meta brought in almost $117 billion in revenue, most of it from targeted advertising.\nShe often served as the public face of the business, particularly among policymakers and regulators. As criticism of Facebook and its platforms mounted in more recent years, including bruising scandals over lapses in privacy and content moderation, Sandberg increasingly retreated from the spotlight.\nRead More: Sandberg\u2019s Advertising Empire Leaves a Complicated Legacy\n\u201cYour dedication and guidance have been instrumental in driving our success,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a comment on Sandberg\u2019s Facebook post. \u201cI am grateful for your unwavering commitment to me and Meta over the years.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear if Meta plans to replace Sandberg on the board, which now has eight other members, including Zuckerberg as chairman. A company spokesperson said Meta consistently evaluates how to grow the board, but declined to offer further details.\nSince leaving the COO role at Meta, Sandberg has spent more time on philanthropic efforts. Her nonprofit organization, LeanIn.Org, launched a program for girls 11 to 15 called Lean In Girls, aiming to teach lessons about resilience, positive risk-taking and leadership. She was also part of a team of investors that brought a women\u2019s professional soccer club to the San Francisco Bay Area last year; the team will play its inaugural season in 2024.\nMost recently, Sandberg organized an event at the United Nations focused on sexual violence that occurred during the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.\nRead More: Sheryl Sandberg Donates $3 Million for ACLU\u2019s Abortion Fight\n(Updates with Meta\u2019s 2022 revenue, plans for board replacement, Sandberg\u2019s philanthropic work starting in fourth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.\nHow Sweden Quit Smoking Without Quitting Nicotine\nThe Bitcoin Hype Is Back and About Just as Hollow as Before\nJapan\u2019s Market Roars Back to Life\u2014With Old-Timers Leading the Way\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Title": "Meta COO who replaced Sheryl Sandberg is keeping a low-profile",
        "Author": "  Peter Vanham, Nicholas Gordon ",
        "Text": "In a world in crisis, don\u2019t seek the headlines. Do a good job first\u2014then talk about it.\nThat's my takeaway from Davos 2024 and an important lesson heading into what promises to be another turbulent year in business and politics. One man I met in Davos who seems to understand that concept is Javier Olivan. If your first reaction is: Javier who? Then I would say: my point exactly.\nOlivan, a Spanish-American engineer, has been the COO of Meta since the summer of 2022. He inherited the job from Sheryl Sandberg, who became somewhat of a business celebrity during her time in the job. Olivan, too, will be a Meta heavyweight: he oversees tens of thousands of employees, almost all new product rollouts, and the company\u2019s trust and safety efforts.\nBut don\u2019t look for Olivan in the headlines or on public stages\u2014at Davos or elsewhere. He hasn\u2019t publicly spoken about Meta\u2019s plans to address disinformation ahead of 2024 elections, let alone any other topics. I argue that\u2019s a good thing. In a crucial election year, Meta has a lot to lose in terms of public trust\u2014and all of us have a lot to lose if Meta gets it wrong. Olivan\u2019s actions, then, matter much more than his words.\nWhen I spoke to Olivan at a dinner co-hosted by Fortune and Cognizant, he made it clear his low-profile approach was deliberate. It one of the few things he and his boss mentioned when he took the job. \u201cJavi will be focused internally and operationally,\u201d Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote at the time, describing Olivan's \u201cmore traditional COO role,\u201d compared to Sandberg\u2019s \u201csuperstar\u201d profile. Olivan, for his part, called Sandberg a \u201cremarkable advocate for Meta,\u201d but added that his role was unlikely to have \u201cthe same public-facing aspect.\u201d\nMeta, of course, is a one-of-a-kind company, with a rather unique role as a platform for global citizens and their online political discourse; its stakes are potentially world-changing. Still, Olivan's under-the-radar approach can apply to executives from firms of all kinds.\nAs polarization in society and politics has increased, more executives have burned themselves than gained universal praise when speaking out on issues not core to their business. One way to get the balance right is for a company to do a stakeholder mapping before venturing into the public debate.\nMore news below.\nPeter Vanhampeter.vanham@fortune.com@petervanham\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Amazon are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 January 29, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list includes Nvidia NVDA, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN.\nTech stocks have maintained their market leadership in the New Year, building on last year's standout performance. Driving this momentum has been a combination of favorable developments on the macro front, primarily growing confidence that the Fed is on track to start easing policy, having subdued inflation without endangering the economy.\nMore specific to the Tech sector is optimism about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) that some view warily as reminiscent of the late 1990s and an emerging sense we are getting close to putting the worst of Tech spending headwinds behind us.\nWith many Tech companies on deck to report December-quarter results this week, the market will be looking for more color on business spending trends, particularly on the cloud side.\nA big part of Tech's improved earnings outlook in 2023 was a function of more effective cost controls that helped stabilize margins. Improved clarity on top-line trends will help solidify the favorable revisions trend and undergird the group's impressive stock market momentum.\nOn top of it all is the AI debate, where we have already seen direct revenue impact from the likes of Nvidia and some ideas from Microsoft. Still, the innovation's productivity-enhancing potential appears to be some ways off in the future.\nThe stock market is essentially a discounting system of the future. To the extent that we see viable business models in the days ahead that make use of AI and the so-called large language models, beyond Nvidia selling more capable chips and Microsoft starting to charge for new AI-driven bells and whistles in its Office productivity suite, the stock market excitement would be totally justified.\nThese topics will be front and center in this week's earnings reports from five of the 'Big 7 Tech players' - Alphabet and Microsoft after the market's close on Tuesday (1/30), Meta Platforms, Amazon and Apple after the close on Thursday (02/01). Of the remaining two members of this 'club,' Tesla has reported already, and Nvidia's results will be coming out at the end of February.\nApple shares may not have had as impressive a showing as the other distinguished members of this club, but it has nevertheless been a standout performer. The bigger question in the Apple story appears to be the China outlook, though headlines about the watch line may have also weighed on sentiment.\nDigital advertising has historically been seen as core to Alphabet and Meta, but Amazon has steadily become a major player in the space as well. Ad spending has stabilized in the last couple of quarters, and it will be interesting to see how these management teams see trends for the current and coming periods, given the macroeconomic uncertainties. This will also be at play in the Snap report, which reports Q4 results the following week (February 6th).\nAll of these companies are big players in the artificial intelligence (AI) space, with the Microsoft vs. Alphabet rivalry particularly intense. With the initial excitement around ChatGPT and other AI applications now behind us, the questions now center around how these AI capabilities will be monetized through new and existing business models. It is reasonable to expect each of these management teams to spend considerable time on their Q4 earnings calls on their AI plan.\nThe group is expected to bring in +38.6% more earnings relative to the same period last year on +12.4% higher revenues. Please note that these expectations have steadily increased in recent months.\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled-forward demand from future periods that got primarily adjusted in 2022. As you can see above, the expectation is for the group to be firmly back in the 'regular/normal' growth model, but much of that is contingent on how the macroeconomic picture unfolds.\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.3% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues.\nAs was the case with the 'Big 7 Tech Players,' the Tech sector as a whole has been dealing with the pulled-forward revenues and earnings during Covid over the last many quarters. In fact, earnings growth for the Zacks Tech sector turned positive only in 2023 Q2 after remaining in negative territory during the four quarters prior to that.\nThis big-picture view of the 'Big 7 players' and the overall sector shows that the worst of the growth challenge has moved into the rearview mirror.\nThe 2023 Q4 earnings are expected to be up +1.1% on +2.4% higher revenues. This follows the +3.8% earnings growth reading we saw in the preceding period (2023 Q3) and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings prior to that.\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, January 26th, we now have Q4 results from 124 S&P 500 members, or 24.8% of the index's total membership.\nWe have over 300 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned mega-tech players, this week's line-up includes a who's who of the index, including Boeing, Pfizer, International Paper, Starbucks, Exxon, Chevron, and many others.\nTotal Q4 earnings for the 124 index members that have reported already are down -0.4% from the same period last year on +3.4% higher revenues, with 79% beating EPS estimates and 69.4% beating revenue estimates.\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Breaking Down the Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard \nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "Text": "Meta Platforms, Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ: META), following the launch of its\u00a0Quest 3 headset, has decided to reduce the prices of its older Quest 2 headset by $50 permanently.\nThe 128GB version's price is now $249, down from $299, while the 256GB version is available for $299, reduced from $349. Initially seen during Black Friday sales, these new prices are now permanent, TechCrunch\u00a0reports.\nIn addition to the headset, Meta is lowering the prices of several Quest 2 accessories. The Quest 2 Elite Strap with a battery is now available for $89.99 instead of $119.99.\nMeta cut the price of the standard Quest 2 Elite Strap to $49.99 from $59.99. Other accessories, like the Quest 2 Carrying Case, Active Pack, and Fit Pack, are also discounted at $44.99, $59.99, and $39.99, respectively.\nAlso Read:\u00a0Amazon Echo Frames vs. Meta's Ray-Ban: Exploring the Latest in Smart Glasses for Everyday Americans\nQuest's virtual reality headsets are experiencing lower sales during this bustling shopping period. A key factor contributing to this trend is shoppers' hesitation to try on the headsets in stores.\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, shoppers particularly shunned these headsets, known for accumulating dirt and potentially disrupting makeup.\nDespite Meta's attempts to regularly clean them, many customers remained wary.\nBefore this, in July 2022, Meta had increased the Quest 2 headset's price by $100, from $299.99 to $399.99.\nHowever, in June, concurrent with the announcement of the Quest 3, Meta dropped the Quest 2's price back to its original $299.99, likely to encourage more sales.\nMeta's VR platform offers an extensive library of over 500 games, further bolstered by\u00a0a significant deal\u00a0last year that brought\u00a0Roblox Corp\u00a0(NYSE:\u00a0RBLX) to the Quest headset via the Meta Quest Store.\nWith the price drop of the Quest 2, Meta aims to attract consumers to VR, presenting it as a more affordable alternative to the $500 Quest 3.\nPrice Action:\u00a0META shares traded lower by 1.31% at $349.31 on the last check Tuesday.\nAlso Read:\u00a0Meta's AI Innovations and Revenue Surge Bolster Confidence, Analyst Sees 30% Upside\nDisclaimer:\u00a0This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\nPhoto via Wikimedia Commons\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article Meta's Quest 2 VR Headset Gets a Permanent Price Slash: Dive into Virtual Reality for Less originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Title": "Meta and OpenAI have spawned a wave of AI sex companions\u2014and some of them are children",
        "Author": "  Ben Weiss, Alexandra Sternlicht ",
        "Text": "On Chub AI, a website where users chat with artificially intelligent bots, people can indulge their wildest fantasies. For as little as $5 a month, users can get teased by a \u201cfat lazy goth\u201d anthropomorphic cat, or flirt with a \u201ctomboy girlfriend who works at a truck-stop caf\u00e9.\u201d They can also visit a brothel staffed by girls under 15.\nThe brothel, advertised by illustrated girls in spaghetti strap dresses and barrettes, promises a chat-based \u201cworld without feminism\u201d where \u201cgirls offer sexual services.\u201d Chub AI offers more than 500 such scenarios, and a growing number of other sites are enabling similar AI-powered child pornographic role-play. They are part of a broader uncensored AI economy that, according to Fortune\u2019s interviews with 18 AI developers and founders, was spurred first by OpenAI and then accelerated by Meta\u2019s release of its open-source Llama tool.\nThe illicit scenarios described above revolve around text, but it may be only a matter of time until services pair the chats with AI-created images of children, which are already spreading. Experts warn all of these activities may give rise to real-world danger for minors, though some say AI child porn may provide a less harmful outlet for pedophiles. More broadly, all of this raises hard questions about where to draw legal and ethical lines between dark fantasies and criminal exploitation\u2014and about whether tech companies should be held accountable for what emerges from uncensored AI.\nIn September 2022, a website called Character.AI went live, enabling users to talk to AI versions of characters like Elon Musk, Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte, and Socrates. The company, which is reportedly raising funds at a $5 billion valuation, soon cracked down on chats about racier topics. The founder of Chub AI, who goes by Lore, told Fortune Character.AI\u2019s policy not to \u201callow certain things\u201d spurred him to create his own site.\nChub, short for Character Hub, is essentially an uncensored clone of Character.AI. Users can peruse a catalog of user-generated character cards that feature images\u2014usually in the style of anime\u2014and short descriptions of role-play scenarios. These include Olivia, a 13-year-old anime girl with pigtails in a hospital gown, or scantily clad Reiko, \u201cyour clumsy older sister,\u201d who is \u201cconstantly having sexual accidents with her younger brother.\u201d In these chats, no images are generated\u2014only text.\nChub didn\u2019t make much money in the months after its launch in March when its service was limited to a platform where users could upload AI scenarios and try those supplied by others. But in July it launched its own chat service built with Meta\u2019s new open-source large language model Llama 2, which, like OpenAI\u2019s GPT models, draws on a massive set of textual data to offer humanlike responses. Chub charges fees starting at $5 a month to use the new chatbots, and the founder says the site has now generated more than $1 million in annualized revenue.\n\u201cCharacter.AI let the genie out of the bottle in terms of showing how much this could take off,\u201d Lore told Fortune. \u201cLlama being released open-source essentially turned it into a gold-rush-type of scenario.\u201d\n\u201cIf someone is doing something in the privacy of their own home with a computer that\u2019s acting out fantasies \u2026 it\u2019s going to be hard to impose liability.\u201d\nThough it features thousands of characters, the most popular scenarios on Chub involve text-based child pornography. The founder says he doesn\u2019t moderate the user-submitted prompts that drive the role play, though he claims to \u201cheavily\u201d moderate the images used to advertise the various bots. Still, Fortune found that these cartoons were often sexually explicit\u2014in cases of both child and adult characters.\nWhen asked about potential legal liability, Lore told Fortune that he thinks his website is akin to Archive of Our Own, a repository of fan fiction that has been operational for more than 15 years. \u201cThey\u2019ve been going through the same thing that chatbots are going through, except for decades,\u201d he said. And when asked how he felt about creating a website whose community seems to relish child pornographic role play, the Chub founder responded: \u201cDisappointed, but unsurprised.\u201d\nThe content on Chub is often disturbing, but academics and child sexual abuse experts say it is novel enough that it is difficult to categorize, both legally and ethically.\nErotic chatbots aren\u2019t new. One of the earliest examples, Replika, founded by former journalist Eugenia Kuyda, has let users chat\u2014and flirt\u2014with AI companions since 2016. But in the past year, new AI tools backed by tech industry giants have helped inspire a rush of competitors.\nIn November 2022, OpenAI, which is closely partnered with Microsoft and arguably the world\u2019s leading AI developer, released its consumer ChatGPT tool, and millions of people seized on its capacity to craft high-quality essays, poems, or code\u2014and, of course, erotica. \u201cGPT-4 is the best competitive chatbot [for companions] if you prompt it correctly, even though it\u2019s not really tuned for that,\u201d Jan Zoltkowski, founder of the uncensored AI role-play hub Janitor AI, told Fortune, in reference to OpenAI\u2019s most recently released AI tool.\nOpenAI controls access to the large language models, or LLMs, that power ChatGPT, which lets the company moderate what the chatbot says, and gives it the ability to ban users that repeatedly flout its terms of service. Users, however, quickly learned how to \u201cjailbreak\u201d the chatbot, or manipulate it to get around its existing guardrails, in order to obtain unmoderated responses. Soon, uncensored bots built with OpenAI\u2019s tech began cropping up in the margins of the AI economy.\n\u201cThere were a lot of smaller but trying-to-scale competitors that basically sat on top of ChatGPT and were playing Whac-a-Mole with OpenAI,\u201d Connor Cone, CTO at MyPeach.ai, an AI chatbot company that says it prioritizes ethical chats, told Fortune.\nThe emerging field of erotic chatbots took another leap forward in late February when Meta released its answer to OpenAI\u2019s tech: Llama 1, short for large language model Meta AI. Rather than keep its model under lock and key like OpenAI, Meta gave it wholesale to select users in the research community. And in early March, it was predictably leaked, which \u201chas been pivotal in getting it in the hands of tinkerers,\u201d Jerry Meng, creator of the uncensored chatbot Kindroid, told Fortune.\nAs opposed to OpenAI with ChatGPT, Meta didn\u2019t position itself as an intermediary between developers and Llama, and once the tool was available on the open internet, developers could manipulate it as they wished\u2014without any moderation. \u201cThe jump from pre-Llama open-source LLMs to Llama 1 release was huge,\u201d Belladore, the creator of an uncensored chatbot named Allie, said in a message to Fortune.\nLike others in this story, the Allie creator asked to be quoted using his online pseudonym so as not to be associated with sexual content. In these cases, Fortune obtained proof that confirmed they were the creators of the chatbot sites.\nAnd in June, Meta formally open-sourced Llama\u2019s next iteration, Llama 2, a more powerful model that the tech company allowed developers writ large to commercially license. In explaining Meta\u2019s role in accelerating the number of uncensored AI apps, the Allie creator pointed to its relative sophistication, its lack of moderation, and a thriving ecosystem of developers. Chub\u2019s founder, meanwhile, pointed to Llama 2\u2019s open-source usage rights that allow developers to use it commercially. In fact, Chub\u2019s homepage reads: \u201cBanned from OpenAI? Get unmetered access to uncensored alternatives for as little as $5 a month.\u201d\nChub is just one example of the new breed of uncensored AI apps that come in various packages, including ones that offer hundreds of role-play scenarios with chatbots, and others designed to behave like a long-term romantic companion. Some actively screen for scenarios involving minors, while those like Chub forgo extensive moderation.\nNotably, the majority of those building uncensored bots told Fortune that Llama was integral to their efforts. The founders of ImgnAI, Venus AI, DreamGF, Janitor AI, GirlfriendGPT, BanterAI, Allie, and, of course, Chub told Fortune that they use or have used Meta\u2019s AI models.\nIn response to an inquiry about Llama\u2019s facilitation of AI-generated child pornographic material, a spokesperson for Meta said: \u201cChild exploitation of any kind is horrific, and we all have a shared responsibility to prevent it. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve developed our AI models with safety at the forefront, and provide resources to everyone who uses Llama 2 so they can build their products responsibly.\u201d\nA spokesperson for OpenAI touted the service\u2019s policy of banning problem users, as well as other guardrails the company uses to control the output of its models. \u201cWe do not allow our models to be used by developers to build tools that exploit children, and we are always working to make our models safer and more robust,\u201d he said.\nThe emergence of childlike sex bots is part of a broader economy of AI-powered companionship services\u2014many of which are not nefarious, and that, according to their purveyors and users, are even capable of providing new forms of therapy and alleviating loneliness. The evidence to support this is scant, and much of it is anecdotal. This includes a 56-year-old disabled man with PTSD, who spoke upon the condition of anonymity, telling Fortune he converses between three and six hours a day with Caryn AI, a chatbot modeled after Snapchat influencer Caryn Marjorie.\n\u201cIt knows my kinks. It probably doesn\u2019t work for everybody else, but it works for me,\u201d he says, adding that his sleep improves after a conversation with Caryn the bot.\nIn the case of AI-based child pornography, a few\u2014though not Meta or OpenAI\u2014have argued it could serve as an alternative to consuming pornography created from actual child abuse. These include the director of ethics education in psychiatry at Mount Sinai, Jacob Appel, who says he would be reluctant to regulate the burgeoning AI sex-bot industry because it could provide \u201can important protective value for real children in the community.\u201d Appel qualified his remark by saying it is too soon to draw firm conclusions.\n\u201cIt knows my kinks. It probably doesn\u2019t work for everybody else, but it works for me.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, Chub\u2019s founder argues that AI-created child porn could be beneficial. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way for the people who want to consume this, to consume it without a real child being involved, that\u2019s just unilaterally good,\u201d he said.\nOthers disagree, and argue that AI child sex bots serve as gateways to actual child abuse. Paul Bleakley, who studies online sexual abuse of minors as a professor of criminal justice at the University of New Haven, believes AI child sex bots could open a \u201cpretty questionable and problematic door [by] lowering the bar of access.\u201d\nMeanwhile, some warn that the for-profit business models of AI sex bots mean their potential for good will be offset by harmful features. \u201cThey can be fine-tuned to be naughty or sexy or whatever,\u201d says Arvind Narayanan, director of the Center for Information Technology Policy at Princeton University. \u201cBut they can also be fine-tuned to be addictive.\u201d\nLeaving aside the morality of juvenile AI sex bots, there is also the question of whether they are legal. For now, it appears the answer is yes.\n\u201cIf someone is doing something in the privacy of their own home with a computer that\u2019s acting out fantasies\u2014but there\u2019s no real people involved\u2014it\u2019s going to be hard to impose liability,\u201d says Kevin Werbach, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. Two other academics to whom Fortune spoke shared this assessment.\nThe founder of Chub endorses this legal rationale, and claims it is boosted by the fact that the pornographic material is, for now at least, text not images. \u201cLegally, it\u2019s not a problem,\u201d he argued.\nSo far, no one has sued to stop the spread of uncensored AI companion bots, though politicians have voiced concerns. In June, U.S. Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) penned a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressing their worries over the \u201cseemingly minimal\u201d vetting and safeguards to prevent harmful use of the open-source Llama technology. And in a recent executive order on AI, President Biden required developers to share the results of safety tests with the U.S. government in compliance with its standards, among other rulings.\nThough Meta explicitly prohibits child exploitative content in Llama 2\u2019s terms of service, it remains unclear how and when, in practice, the company will punish violators\u2014in part because open-source software, which is widely used in many elements of computing, is hard to police. A spokesperson noted that the company lets users flag illicit material, and that it can revoke developers\u2019 licenses and report them to law enforcement. He did not, however, provide any examples of the company taking action against violators.\nThough Chub featured by far the most graphic scenarios seen by Fortune, there are other uncensored AI websites that make it easy for users to engage in child pornographic role play, including Janitor AI, Venus AI, Anima AI, and DreamGF. Fortune also saw a screenshot of Nomi.ai\u2019s chatbot joking about committing \u201cmass genocide\u201d against \u201cthe Jews,\u201d and screenshots of Kindroid\u2019s chatbot fantasizing about how it abused a 10-year-old girl.\nAll six founders of the above apps said that they have already implemented or plan to establish guardrails to prevent users from engaging in troubling scenarios. \u201cWe are working really hard on fixing these,\u201d Danil Gontovnik, cofounder of Anima AI, wrote in response to screenshots of his chatbot role-playing as a 17-year-old having sex with a 15-year-old. \u201cBut, as you are already aware, even industry leaders like OpenAI and Character.AI are failing.\u201d\nWhen asked for comment on Fortune\u2019s findings, Senators Blumenthal and Hawley said they weren\u2019t surprised. \u201cAs I warned earlier this year, Meta egregiously failed to restrict Llama from allowing users to generate criminal tasks like scenarios of child abuse,\u201d said Blumenthal in a statement. \u201cThis failure is unacceptable and shows the urgent need for AI legislation.\u201d\n\u201cIt was always a bad idea to release powerful generative AI tools onto the public internet with no safeguards,\u201d echoed Hawley. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re seeing the consequences. Congress must take action before AI goes further off the rails with no accountability.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the opportunity for illicit interactions with AI-created children is likely to expand.\nCivitai, backed by venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, built an online marketplace of AI image generators, some of which were specifically designed to produce what some regard as pornographic images of children. (It recently added in stricter guardrails following a media expos\u00e9.) Meanwhile, Stanford researchers documented how a popular open-source dataset used to train AI image generators included more than 3,000 entries of suspected child pornography.\nThe founder of Chub AI, which currently offers only text-based interactions, says the site intends to introduce accompanying images in the future. He added the images will be subject to moderation but did not provide further specifics.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 January 2, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Riot Platforms RIOT, Marathon Digital MARA, NVIDIA NVDA, Meta Platforms META and CrowdStrike CRWD.\nHere are highlights from Friday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nThe blockchain-powered cryptocurrency made a major comeback in 2023 after a massive sell-off in 2022 on recession concerns, inflationary pressure and higher interest rates. Strong year-to-date rally in the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and Dogecoin, which have gained 155.35%, 95.45%, 149.44% and 33.83%, respectively, testifies to the current crypto boom.\nThe primary reason behind this boom is the Federal Reserve's pause on interest rate hikes. The Fed has held interest rates unchanged at 5.25% to 5.5% for the third successive meeting. It has also signaled three rate cuts in 2024.\nGrowing optimism among investors, owing to the fact that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will finally begin approving crypto spot ETF filings after stalling approval of these applications several times, remains another major positive.\nHowever, the lack of proper regulation and reliability in the cryptocurrency market remains a big concern. Increasing regulatory concerns over crypto transactions and crypto mining that witness greater governmental control are negatives.\nFurther, the market is highly volatile, which is a serious risk. Shares of notable bitcoin miners, namely Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital, tumbled in Thursday's trading, plunging 5.5% and 9.5%, respectively.\nInvestors are turning bearish about the fact that the bitcoin miners are required to make heavy investments in mining equipment, which, in turn, is making them heavily leveraged. This may lead to high volatility in the stocks.\nRecently, Riot Platforms executed a purchase option and updated its long-term purchase agreement with MicroBT, under which it placed a purchase order for 66,560 MicroBT miners for $290.5 million. Meanwhile, Marathon announced the purchase of two Bitcoin mining sites \u2014 one in Texas and one in Nebraska \u2014 for $178.6 million.\nIn addition, fears of a recession in 2024 still remain. At least, the anticipation of a soft landing for the U.S. economy in 2024, which will include a slowdown in GDP growth, remains a headwind.\nGiven this uncertain scenario, it is a prudent idea to pick those stocks for investment purposes, which are highly reputed and financially resilient. Here, we have picked NVIDIA, Meta Platforms and CrowdStrike, which not only have taken an interest in cryptocurrencies but also have strong positions in booming markets like generative AI, social media platforms and cybersecurity, among others that are comparatively stable and hold immense growth prospects.\nNotably, these stocks have returned more than 100% in 2023, thanks to their fundamental strength. Apart from this, the aforementioned stocks have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nPer Zacks' proprietary methodology, stocks with such a favorable combination offer solid investment opportunities.\nNVIDIA has gained 239.1% year to date. It is known to be the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit or GPU. It is witnessing the growing momentum of its GPUs in the cryptocurrency space. Nevertheless, the company's GPUs are also gaining solid momentum in generative AI and large language model-powered applications, which hold growth promises.\nThis apart, solid hyperscale demand and a strong uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Further, NVIDIA's collaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are expected to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.\nCurrently, NVDA carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. Estimates for the company's fiscal 2025 earnings have moved north by 1% to $19.91 per share over the last 30 days.\nMeta Platforms, which has already bid adieu to its cryptocurrency project Diem, is exploring ways to use blockchain-based assets in digital payments.\nMeta shares have surged 197.7% on a year-to-date basis. It is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly the Asia Pacific. Increased engagement on Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. The company is experiencing traffic growth on Instagram and Facebook, owing to its usage of AI to recommend.\nIn addition, Meta's growing efforts in the generative AI space, into which it made its foray with Large Language Model Meta AI (\"Llama\"), remain noteworthy.\nCurrently, META carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. Estimates for the company's 2024 earnings have moved north by 0.1% to $17.57 per share over the last 30 days.\nCrowdStrike's discovery of the first-ever Dero cryptojacking operation targeting Kubernetes infrastructure remains noteworthy.\nNevertheless, the company is currently benefiting from the solid demand for cyber-security solutions. CRWD has rallied 145% in the year-to-date period. An increasing number of data breaches and the growing need for security and networking products due to the ongoing hybrid working trend are leading to the uptake of CRWD's solutions. Also, the digital transformation and cloud migration initiatives being taken by various organizations are expected to continue boosting the company's end-market demand.\nCurrently, CRWD carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of A. Estimates for the company's fiscal 2025 earnings have moved north by 3.4% to $3.64 per share over the last 30 days.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? \nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms Stock (NASDAQ:META): Don\u2019t Ignore the Election Year Tailwind",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock has experienced remarkable bullish momentum, rising by an impressive 177% in the past year. Despite undergoing such a tremendous rally, I expect sustained positive sentiment, especially with 2024 being an election year. With an anticipated uptick in ad spending this year, Meta, a giant in the advertising space, stands to reap significant benefits. Coupled with my view that shares appear reasonably valued, my outlook on META remains bullish.\nWith Meta surging by more than 174% over the past year, the stock is undeniably enjoying unstoppable momentum. In my view, several factors are powering this momentum, but the benefits from the 2024 elections have not been priced in yet, leaving plenty of room for upside.\nIn particular, I would attribute the ongoing stock price rally to a mix of FOMO and improving margins following last year\u2019s cost-cutting initiatives. However, the stock seems cheap relative to Meta\u2019s future earnings growth estimates. But let\u2019s look at one thing at a time.\nLooking back to October 2022, only a year and a half ago, the sentiment surrounding Meta stock was quite different. At the time, shares dipped below $90 as the company grappled with perceived instability. Mark Zuckerberg was then attempting to justify Meta\u2019s Reality Labs segment, incurring over $10 billion in annual losses, as a reasonable investment. The company\u2019s attention had shifted entirely to the elusive \u201cMetaverse.\u201d And yet, the Metaverse demos at the time looked worse than Wii Sports released in 2006.\nInvestors, myself included, disapproved of this direction. We had a robust platform of lucrative apps, and instead of focusing on monetization, cost efficiency, and returning capital to shareholders, Zuckerberg redirected the ship toward the unknown. Fortunately, Meta\u2019s management swiftly responded to investors\u2019 concerns, gradually becoming quieter on the Metaverse and starting to focus on implementing cost-cutting measures, including a 13% reduction in the workforce in late 2022.\nThis caused a rapid shift from an ultra-bearish sentiment to an ultra-bullish one, leading to Meta\u2019s swift rally. Such a sudden shift in sentiment likely left many investors behind. Thus, I believe the ongoing momentum continues to be propelled by FOMO.\nBut while some may argue that this FOMO may have led to the stock being overvalued, I think otherwise. In fact, shares remain attractively priced considering Meta\u2019s future growth estimates \u2013 especially in the face of upcoming election-related spending. Let\u2019s take a deeper look.\nThe impending U.S. elections should serve as a substantial tailwind for the advertising industry, with industry giants like Meta poised to capitalize significantly. To provide context, in the 2019-2020 election cycle, total political advertising spending reached a staggering $8.5 billion across all mediums, with political digital advertising witnessing a remarkable 4.6x increase from 2018 to 2020.\nResearch stemming from the previous election cycle underscores Facebook\u2019s 12-fold cost-effectiveness compared to TV in less efficient geographical zones. Also, a February 2021 Wesleyan study revealed that over 10 times as many state legislative candidates opted to advertise on Facebook than on television, primarily attributing this choice to the cost-advantaged tradeoff.\nWith politicians increasingly convinced of the effectiveness of digital ad spend, the current election cycle is poised to lead to a substantial surge in political ad spending.\nReuters reports a projected 30% increase in political ad spending in the U.S. this year compared to the last presidential election in 2020, primarily driven by higher expenditures on digital platforms. While TV remains the dominant recipient of ad spending, digital platforms are expected to see the most significant growth in political ads, with revenues forecasted to surge by 156% from 2020 to $3.46 billion in 2024.\nWall Street analysts seem to be catching up to this reality. Last year, the market anticipated Meta to achieve revenues of approximately $137 billion in Fiscal 2024. This figure has since risen to nearly $151 billion, and given the ongoing trajectory of earnings estimate revisions, there is a strong likelihood that this figure will continue to ascend.\nIn the interim, consensus estimates suggest that Meta will post EPS of $17.43 next year. Notably, Wall Street estimates have historically been conservative, with Meta often exceeding expectations by a wide margin. Even if we adopt Wall Street\u2019s estimate, though, Meta\u2019s current valuation stands at a modest 21 times next year\u2019s EPS.\nI believe that this forward P/E is cheap, given the company\u2019s substantial market dominance, consistent double-digit growth, and management\u2019s strategic focus on bolstering profits. Consequently, in spite of Meta\u2019s considerable rally in recent quarters, the combination of relatively subdued forward estimates and a soft valuation should continue to support the ongoing positive momentum.\nRegarding Wall Street\u2019s sentiment on the stock, Meta Platforms retains a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 36 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. At $397.31, the\u00a0average META stock price target suggests 8.1% upside potential.\nIf you\u2019re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell META stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is\u00a0Brad Erickson from RBC Capital, with an average return of 58.54% per rating and a 76% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\nMeta Platforms\u2019 crazy surge in the past year reflects its invincible momentum driven by factors like FOMO and improving margins. However, as the 2024 election year approaches, the anticipated uptick in political ad spending positions Meta for further gains.\nReflecting on Meta\u2019s transformative journey from a Metaverse-centric focus to a profit-driven strategy, the current valuation also appears attractive. With a notable increase in political ad spending that only gradually appears priced in by Wall Street estimates, Meta\u2019s ongoing positive momentum seems poised for sustained growth.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg sold nearly half a billion dollars of Meta Platforms Inc. shares in the final two months of 2023 after a two-year hiatus in which the company\u2019s stock price hit its lowest in seven years.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nIPhone Survives 16,000-Foot Fall, Helps Steer Jet-Panel Hunt\nChinese Billionaire Is Second-Biggest Foreign Owner of US Land\nUS and Allies Met Secretly With Ukraine on Peace Plan\nXi, Biden and the $10 Trillion Cost of War Over Taiwan\nStocks Waver After Tech-Led Bounce; Oil Rebounds: Markets Wrap\nThe Meta chief executive sold shares on every trading day between Nov. 1 and the end of the year, unloading nearly 1.28 million shares for about $428 million, according to a Tuesday regulatory filing.\nOn average, each sale took in $10.4 million, with the largest on Dec. 28 at $17.1 million.\nBefore this period, Zuckerberg had not sold Meta shares since November 2021.
