(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss.\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) market continues to show tremendous growth, with significant advances across sectors. According to a report by McKinsey on the AI industry, the AI revolution is driving innovation across industries, with investment in AI increasing sevenfold in recent years despite economic downturns in other tech sectors. This surge is primarily fueled by the growing demand for AI applications in data analysis, content generation, and predictive modeling. In particular, generative AI has drawn the most attention, revolutionizing industries like marketing, customer service, and product design\u200b. Moreover, high-performing companies are heavily investing in AI to gain a competitive edge. These firms, often referred to as AI high performers, allocate a significant portion of their digital budgets \u2013 over 20% \u2013 to AI technologies. They prioritize AI not only for cost reductions but also for new revenue streams.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a033 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To\u00a0and\u00a020 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThe market for AI applications is set to expand even further, with several industry reports predicting that by 2030, AI could contribute up to $13 trillion to the global economy. Over a course of the next decade, informed estimates by investment advisors at Goldman Sachs indicate that these AI tools could drive a 7% increase in global GDP, worth nearly $7 trillion, and lift productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points overall. Moreover, the bank expects established businesses around the world to spend nearly $1 trillion on developing AI infrastructure in the coming years\nProminent businesses have taken note of these developments. Latest reports suggest that investment titan BlackRock, in partnership with tech giants is likely to launch a more than $30 billion fund focused on AI. The fund will invest in artificial intelligence infrastructure to build data centers and energy projects. The need for energy is a source of particular interest to the business community as AI models require substantial computational power, leading to higher energy consumption.\nThe sheer scale of computational power required for AI workloads has also forced tech giants to build supercomputer clusters, stringing together expensive chips, cooling systems, networking tools, and other high-tech gear to crunch data. These AI data centers will likely consume a growing amount of energy as the use cases of AI expand. McKinsey estimates that by 2025, 15% to 20% of all data center workloads will be AI-driven, compared to less than 5% in 2020. Furthermore, according to a report from the International Energy Agency, AI data centers could account for as much as 13% of global electricity demand by 2030 if current growth trends continue. Tech giants are thus investing billions of dollars into expanding their AI infrastructure.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The company recently coordinated the penning of an open letter to the European Union, authored by senior executives at several tech firms, which warned the EU that it risked missing out on the full benefits of AI due to tech rules that invited inconsistent regulatory decision making. Per news publication The Wall Street Journal, nearly two dozen firms signed the letter, which noted that AI could boost productivity and expand the economy, but Europe may reap fewer rewards of this.\nDA Davidson recently initiated coverage of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock with a Buy rating and $600 price target. The investment advisor called Meta a top pick within the mega-cap space, citing its combination of emerging leadership in the most important future technology platforms and an attractive relative valuation. Per analysts at DA Davidson, aside from Alphabet, Meta was the least expensive mega cap, even before factoring for the option to sever Reality Labs losses, which would take the multiple down to 16-times, thus providing downside protection.\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of AI news and analyst ratings that you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Meta stock (META) traded at a new all-time intraday high Thursday, following a developer event that put its artificial intelligence ambitions on display. Shares rose as high as $577 after market open before edging down 0.7%, or around $564, mid-morning.\nAt Meta Connect 2024 on Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled Meta\u2019s newest AI model, Llama 3.2. The tech giant also revealed its new \u201cOrion\u201d augmented reality glasses, as well as its latest Ray Ban smart glasses and mixed-reality Quest headset.\nMeta has raced to catch up with competitors in the AI space \u2014 fellow Big Tech firms like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) as well as the startup and AI leader OpenAI. And while it\u2019s not as popular as ChatGPT, Meta claimed in April that its AI has an equivalent of 185 million weekly active users, close behind ChatGPT\u2019s 200 million.\nMeta released an AI model, Llama 3.1, this summer, which it claimed could outperform OpenAI\u2019s models in several areas. Llama 3.2 is another stride forward for Meta as it looks to take on OpenAI and other AI players. It\u2019s Meta\u2019s first open-source model that can process images, charts, graphs, and text, and it will enable developers using Llama 3.2 to build more complex applications.\nThe company said Llama 3.2 is competitive with OpenAI\u2019s GPT4o-mini and outperforms Google\u2019s AI model Gemma by some metrics. And its AI assistant available on Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Facebook can now speak in the voices of celebrities including Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key, and Kristen Bell.\nZuckerberg said Meta had \u201creached an inflection point in the industry\u201d in which its AI model, Llama, is \u201cstarting to become something of an industry standard.\u201d\nAnalysts contend that Meta is well-positioned among its competitors. \u201cWe believe Meta Connect reflected Meta\u2019s ambitions to be one of the leading AI companies and to shape the industry,\u201d wrote JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth in a note to investors Thursday morning.\n\u201cMark Zuckerberg showcased Meta's AI future at Meta Connect leaving us more bullish on Meta's consumer & enterprise AI opportunities,\u201d wrote Jefferies analysts. \u201cOn the enterprise, Llama is becoming a serious contender and we see momentum building with its new multimodal capabilities.\u201d\nBank of America analysts on Thursday raised its price target on the stock to $630. JPMorgan expects Meta shares to rise even higher, to $640, while Jefferies reiterated its price target of $600. The average Wall Street forecast for Meta's stock price over the next 12 months is a bit lower at $583, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Some 88% of Wall Street analysts covering the stock recommend buying it.\nBut it may take a while for Meta to reap the full benefits of its AI innovations. Jefferies analysts noted a \u201cpotential multi-year lag between investments and revenue\u201d but said they are \"confident in Meta's proven ability to successfully scale & monetize new products.\"\nMeanwhile, Meta\u2019s costly Reality Labs division, which works on its metaverse products, continues to lose the company billions of dollars. The team\u2019s hefty spending has cost the company $50 billion so far, and JPMorgan analysts project Reality Labs will lose Meta another $23 billion in 2025.\nMeta may not have fully monetized its AI advancements just yet, but its moves in the AI space have certainly boosted its stock. Meta is part of the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech stocks, which have rallied to unprecedented price levels over the past year. Meta stock is up by nearly 91% over the last year, including over 60% in 2024.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Invest In Right Now.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other NASDAQ stocks.\nThis year has been a healthy year for the American stock market, fueled by a strong performance from technology stocks. Several indices capped their best week of the year in early September as stocks rose ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting where the central bank was expected to cut interest rates. NASDAQ has led the charge and registered a 20% growth during the first half.\nWhile the index lists over 3,100 companies from various sectors, the rally has been led by its top seven holdings which account for 52% of the index. All of them being tech stocks. There is a mix of optimism and skepticism among investors on whether NASDAQ will be able to continue its good run over the second half of the year. Historical data over the past decade shows that in most instances, NASDAQ has finished stronger during the back half of the year. There have only been two years between 2014 and 2023 during which NASDAQ\u2019s year-end returns were lower than first-half returns.\nHowever, Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee, who is generally bullish on the stock market, told CNBC earlier this month that investors need to be cautious, as stocks could fall 10% during the next eight weeks amid interest rate cuts and the nervousness around the upcoming presidential elections. The co-founder of the research firm also suggested that if the dip is too strong, it should be viewed as a buying opportunity for investors. Lee has largely been on the money and nailed most stock calls this year.\nOther analysts also anticipate market volatility ahead of the presidential elections. Liz Young Thomas, the head of investment strategy at SoFi, while talking to Business Insider noted that stock activity lags between June and August while traders are on vacation. This results in strong market performance aided by thinner trade volumes. The activity jumps up significantly in September when they return to their desks, which often leads to stock price volatility. According to her, a two percent shift in share price in either direction has become the norm in September. However, during election years, the volatility is at its peak in mid-October instead of September, and the market returns to normalcy after the results are announced.\nLPL Financial's Adam Turnquist also expects seasonal shakiness in the months ahead, but pointed out, like Lee did, that the dip presents an opportunity to buy when the share is trading low and earn high returns when the market stabilizes.\nBuying the September or October lows has been a very good trade. October, things start to improve, and then you have this November, December, year-end rally, typically very high average returns and high positivity rates for those months.\nBoth Turnquist and Young Thomas agreed that existing portfolios should not be readjusted because of seasonal volatility because it is short-term and hard to forecast.\nWith that said, let\u2019s head over to see some of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy right now, given the current trends and future projections.\nWe scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 912 hedge funds for the second quarter of 2024 to look for stocks listed on NASDAQ and picked the top 10 companies with the highest number of hedge funds having stakes in them. We ranked them in ascending order of hedge fund holders in each company.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is an American multinational company headquartered in Menlo Park, California. It formerly operated as Facebook, Inc. until its rebranding in 2021. It is one of the largest technology companies in the world and owns popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. More than 3.2 billion people use at least one of Meta\u2019s apps every day, according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\nThe company posted robust financial results during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, with total revenue reaching $39.1 billion, representing a 22% year-over-year increase. Net income for the quarter was $13.5 billion, with an earnings per share of $5.16, comfortably beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $4.72. Revenue from Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s Family of Apps totaled $38.7 billion in Q2, up 22% from last year. Most of this was ad revenue, with the online commercial vertical being the largest contributor, followed by gaming.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s ability to generate solid ad revenue despite global economic challenges has been the catalyst behind the company\u2019s growth and has boosted investor confidence. Its share price has grown 58% year-to-date, with analysts predicting a further 1-2% increase in the coming months. There\u2019s a consensus among Street experts on the stock\u2019s Strong Buy rating.\nMoreover, the company has spent billions in recent years on artificial intelligence, resulting in the launch of successful products like Meta Quest 3 and Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, whose demand has outpaced the company\u2019s expectations. These investments in advanced technology have led to a general bullish sentiment about the stock\u2019s long-term trajectory. According to Insider Monkey\u2019s database as of Q2 2024, 219 hedge funds have a stake in the company, making it one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now.\nHaving said that, while Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) looks set for long-term growth, some challenges on the horizon could impact the stock in the short term. One of them is the slowdown in revenue the company has anticipated for Q3 2024 compared to last year when much of the revenue was driven by a surge of China-based advertisers on its social media apps and the growth experienced by Reels impressions. That is unlikely to happen this year. Furthermore, the company plans on spending around $40 billion on capital expenditure this year, which could impact its short-term financials, and subsequently, its share price.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in right now.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks you shouldn't miss.\nAI presents significant benefits for investors, primarily through increased efficiency, automation, and the potential for high returns in specific sectors. It leads to higher profitability and efficiency. For example, AI-driven automation enhances efficiency in trading, portfolio management, and operations, helping investors achieve better returns. According to a report by PwC, financial institutions that adopt AI could reduce operational costs by 22% in the short term, which directly improves profitability. Hedge funds, for instance, have seen an increase in efficiency, particularly in areas such as algorithmic trading and risk management. A report by McKinsey suggests that AI-driven trading algorithms can outperform traditional investment strategies by identifying patterns and trends that are hard for human analysts to spot. This advantage could increase returns by 2-3% annually, which can compound into significant gains over time.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nAI tools also provide real-time data analytics and insights, giving investors a competitive edge in making informed decisions. According to a study by Deloitte, 63% of financial executives believe that AI can dramatically improve investment decision-making by providing better market forecasts and risk assessments. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data quickly, allowing investors to capitalize on short-term market movements with greater precision. Similarly, the explosion of generative AI and machine learning has led to a surge in stocks related to AI technology. Several AI-focused exchange traded funds (ETFs) have outperformed the broader market, providing investors with opportunities for growth. For instance, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF has returned close to 30% in the past year, significantly outperforming traditional tech funds.\nTom Kehoe, a top researcher at Alternative Investment Management Association, an investment firm in the United Kingdom, has emphasized that AI is poised to revolutionize investment management, offering greater efficiency and precision in decision-making. Similarly, Larry Fink, the CEO of investment titan BlackRock, believes that AI will be a transformative force for wealth management, allowing firms to personalize portfolios and scale operations efficiently, which in turn create immediate value for investors. Fink was quoted by Financial Times as saying that the collapse of productivity had been a central issue in the global economy. Per Fink, AI had the huge potential to increase productivity, and transform margins across sectors, as it may be the technology that brought down inflation.\nRead more about these developments by accessing\u00a0Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the latest and most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

        "Text": "The S&P 500 just hit an all-time high, but only one \"Magnificent Seven\" stock is there with it.\nThat's Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), which has gone from a disaster just two years ago with a plunging stock price to a company that's leading the artificial intelligence (AI) transition and delivering blockbuster results in its core advertising business. Investors have taken notice, and the stock is up more than 500% from its collapse nearly two years ago to today.\nLet's look at the factors driving the stock higher and why Meta could still gain from here.\nNvidia dominates the market for AI hardware, but there's more to it than just chips. There needs to be a product built on that hardware, of course, and arguably no company has built a more compelling ecosystem than Meta Platforms.\nAt the Meta Connect Conference this week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta AI has nearly 500 million monthly active users, and it's on track to be the most-used AI assistant in the world, beating out competitors like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Alphabet's Google Gemini.\nNearly half of the world uses one of Meta's platforms daily -- including Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- giving the company a built-in advantage over competitors and an easy way of introducing new technology to its users.\nWith its own large language model, Llama, the company's vertical integration is hard to match.\nMeta just rolled out a slew of new features, allowing users to talk to Meta AI, share photos with it, and provide customizable AI that businesses can use for customer service and other forms of assistance.\nOver a million advertisers are also using its generative AI tools to build ads as well, showing how broad the reach of its technology is. Those ads even outperformed ones that didn't use AI.\nMeta's advertising business foundered during the industry downturn in 2022 as businesses prepared for a recession that never happened.\nBut the advertising business has come roaring back since then thanks to the company's execution in new products like Reels, the proliferation of AI and commerce tools, and a user base that continues to grow.\nIn fact, Meta is outgrowing other major ad platforms. In the second quarter, its advertising revenue jumped 22% to $38.3 billion. By comparison, Alphabet reported just 14% growth at Google Search and 13% at YouTube, while its Google Network business serving ads on third-party sites declined.\nAmazon, which had long outgrown Alphabet and Meta, reported 20% growth in the second quarter to $12.8 billion, and it beat smaller social media platforms like Pinterest and Snap.\nMeta stock is arguably getting pricey at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29, but the company consistently beat earnings estimates in recent quarters, and it has several levers it can pull to drive its growth from here.\nThe company continues to spend aggressively on its Reality Labs segment, putting billions of dollars a year on the engine behind AI and projects like the metaverse. There's room to control some of that spending if investors demand it, as the company demonstrated during its \"year of efficiency.\"\nMeta continues to make strides in hardware with its Quest virtual-reality devices, a collaboration with Ray-Ban to make smart glasses, and the Orion augmented-reality (AR) glasses it just unveiled, though the company says those last ones are likely years away from being available to customers.\nMeta believes that Orion is the most advanced pair of AR glasses ever made, and it promises that the billions it has poured into research and development will continue to yield new devices like Orion.\nInvestors might think of these new devices as moonshots, but only one of them needs to hit to pay off for Meta. And its current valuation doesn't seem to reflect the potential of its devices, but they could be a significant part of the business in five to ten years.\nIn the meantime, management is executing effectively in the advertising business, and the company looks well positioned to remain a leader in AI. Meta Platforms is undoubtedly headed for further growth, and as it delivers, the stock will move higher.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Mark Zuckerberg, the founder behind Meta (previously Facebook), leaped into the ranks of the world's fourth-richest person with a net worth of $201 billion. His spectacular rise comes after the strategic shift of Meta into metaverse hardware and artificial intelligence from October 2021.\nMeta's stock is making a roaring comeback, trading at around $567 per share, a massive six-fold hike from its November 2022 price of about $88. It has made this dramatic turn in fortune after investors had been initially skeptical of the ambitious foray into developing augmented reality and AI that the company embarked on.\nThe financial rise by Zuckerberg now places him in the company of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault, according to Bloomberg's latest wealth ranking. Half of the world's top 10 most valuable companies, including tech giants Apple, Google, Nvidia, and Microsoft, are now developing their own metaverse hardware.\nDuring a recent Meta Connect event in California, Zuckerberg unveiled two of the company's latest creations: Orion augmented reality glasses and the more affordable Quest 3S VR headset. These Orion glasses boast advanced projectors that can beam a virtual heads-up display onto the real world, a new direction that Meta is taking in its commitment to immersive technology.\nDespite high-flying stocks, the company imposed a 20% budget cut on its metaverse division, Reality Labs, and asked for a 20% reduction in departmental expenses by 2026. In fact, Reality Labs was among the most expensive Meta projects, having lost some $60 billion since 2019 and continuing to remain in loss during the second quarter of 2024.\nZuckerberg has made clear that Meta intends to scale its AI business by narrowing the focus of the company and putting more capital investment into AI research. \"We've released the first frontier-level open-source AI model, and we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses,\" Zuckerberg said on the recent earnings call.\n"

They usually don\u2019t waste time with underperformers\u2014they target the market's elite.\nBefore diving into the top stock picks among billionaires, reviewing how the market has performed so far this year is essential. On September 18, the Federal Reserve cut its policy rate by 50 basis points, lowering it to 4.75%\u20135.00% from 5.25%\u20135.50%. This move fueled a market rally, pushing stocks to a new intraday record high, and marking the 39th all-time high of 2024\u2014the first since mid-July. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari acknowledged that while the rate cut was unusual historically, shifting the policy focus from controlling high inflation to addressing a weakening labor market was necessary. Here are some comments:\n\u201cRight now, we still have a strong, healthy labor market. But I want to keep it a strong, healthy labor market, and a lot of the recent inflation data is coming in looking very positive that we\u2019re on our way back to 2%. So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to find anybody at the Federal Reserve who declares mission accomplished, but we are paying attention to what risks are most likely to materialize in the near future.\u201d\nMarket expectations point to an equal probability of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) cutting rates by either a quarter- or half-percentage point at its November meeting, with a higher chance of the larger reduction in December. Overall, markets are signaling the Fed\u2019s intent to bring rates to a \"neutral\" level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth.\nFor nearly two years, bulls have dominated Wall Street, driven by a resilient U.S. economy and growing enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI). This momentum has propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to multiple record highs in 2024. Despite the surge, not everyone seems hopeful about the market, with some of the most influential billionaire investors, including Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, signaling caution. Buffett, known for his long-term optimism, has been a net seller of stocks for seven straight quarters.\nOn the other hand, billionaire investor Ray Dalio recently raised concerns about the \"enormous amount of debt\" burdening the U.S. economy. He cautions that neither former President Donald Trump nor Vice President Kamala Harris is likely to focus on addressing debt sustainability in the upcoming presidential election, suggesting that the pressure from the $35.3 trillion national debt will persist, regardless of the election outcome.\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we analyzed Insider Monkey's exclusive database of billionaire stock holdings to select the 10 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors.

        "Author": "  Daniyal Jawaid ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of 10 Best Stocks To Buy Right Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we will look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks among the 10 best stocks to buy right now according to billionaire Cliff Asness.\nThe investment approach of Cliff Asness, through his multi-billion dollar hedge fund AQR Capital Management, is quite unique. While some investors such as\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0and\u00a0Seth Klarman\u00a0focus on value, and others like\u00a0Ken Fisher\u00a0focus on growth, Asness\u2019 fund tries to quantitatively define what quality is.\nWhile it sounds like a tall order, the hedge fund investor whose latest net worth is estimated to be $2 billion, has written quite a bit on the determinants of a quality stock. One such work came in the form of a research paper published in 2013. In it, Asness and his co authors shared three primary drivers of a quality stock. These are a stock\u2019s profitability, growth, and safety. Within these three factors, profitability is driven by gross profits over assets, return on equity, return on assets, cash flow over assets, gross margin, and the portion of earnings that was cash. A quality stock\u2019s growth is determined by the five year average growth in the per share values of the first five profitability factors, while a stock\u2019s safety is based on its beta, leverage, bankruptcy risk, and return on equity volatility.\nUsing these metrics, Asness built two portfolios. The first portfolio selected stocks based on the quality metrics, while the latter, called Quality Minus Junk (QMJ) goes long on the quality stocks and shorts the junk stocks. QMJ is more characteristic of AQR Capital\u2019s investment approach. The results showed that without adjusting for risk, the ten sub quality portfolios starting from a quality score of one and ending at ten all had positive excess returns over Treasury bills.\nThese\u00a0returns\u00a0ranged from 28 basis points of excess returns for the lowest quality portfolio to 70 basis points for the highest quality portfolio. The difference in the highest and lowest returns for these portfolios was the sharpest when they were tuned for the Carhart Four Factor Model that adds momentum to the traditional three factor Fama Factor model. The difference was 105 basis points per month for the four factor adjustment.\nLooking at the\u00a0returns\u00a0for the QMJ portfolio, these jump to 60 basis points for the four factor model for US stocks and 61 basis points per month for the three and four factor models for global equities. When the US and global monthly excess returns are\u00a0plotted\u00a0over time for cumulative alpha, they sit at roughly 425% for the US between 1957 and 2016 and at 200% for global stocks between 1986 and 2012.\nShifting gears, as 2023 proved to be beneficial to the stock market because of returns driven by large cap stocks and artificial intelligence, AQR Capital also posted strong results. As per Reuters, the fund\u2019s Absolute Return Strategy delivered 18.5% in returns in 2023, while the AQR Equity Market Neutral Global Value strategy returned a stronger 20.6% in net returns. Before fees, the Absolute Return\u2019s returns were 55%, with the net, or post fee returns sitting at 43.5% in 2022\u00a0according\u00a0to Bloomberg,\nAQR\u2019s double digit performance continued during the first quarter. More data sourced by Bloomberg shows that AQR\u2019s Managed Futures Full Volatility Strategy, Delphi Long Short Equity Strategy, and Apex Strategy gained 17.4%, 13%, and 11%, during Q1 2024. Insider Monkey\u2019s data shows that the cumulative value of the hedge fund\u2019s stock holdings filed with the SEC was $58.7 billion by the end of that time period marking a $13.1 billion or 28.7% annual jump. Double digit returns in a quarter are no small matter, and some of the best known hedge funds such as\u00a0Citadel Wellington,\u00a0Point72, and\u00a0Millennium\u00a05.8%, 5.3%, and 3.7% in respective returns during the same time period.\nBefore we get to our list of Cliff Asness\u2019 top stock picks, it\u2019s also important to see how his firms\u2019 funds have performed so far during the year. September has marked the start of a paradigm shift on Wall Street in the form of the Federal Reserve starting its interest rate cuts in the form of a 50 basis point cut. However, the Fed\u2019s data seems to have disappointed investors as it indicates that as of mid September, it expects the rate to sit at 3.25% \u2013 3.50% by 2025 end.\nWhen looking at the returns of AQR\u2019s different funds year to date, it appears that momentum is one of the top plays as of now. This is because the AQR Large Cap Momentum Style Fund has delivered 21.70% in year to date returns which is roughly three percentage points higher than the benchmark index\u2019s 18.64% in returns. On the flip side, the AQR Large Cap Defensive Style Fund has delivered 16.11% in year to date returns which are 2.53 percentage points lower than the benchmark\u2019s returns. Judging by this, the momentum fund which touts to invest in stocks \u201cconsidered to have positive momentum if it has performed well in the prior 12 months relative to other stocks in the investment universe\u201d has been the way to go so far in 2024.\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to buy according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of his fund AQR Capital\u2019s Q2 2024 13F SEC filings and picked out the most valuable stakes.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors based on Insider Monkey\u2019s research. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 219\nAQR Funds\u2019 Latest Investment Stake: $811 million\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. With more than 3.2 billion people using its platform as of March 2024, the firm enjoys a considerable presence in the social media industry. This is key for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), as it enables it to ensure that advertisers are eager to run their ads on its platform. Ad revenue is one of the biggest revenue streams for the firm, and it has grown in importance as of late due to Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s aggressive AI investments. Key drivers for its share price include revenue per user, the ability to monetize AI, and maintain or grow its user base. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also using AI to enable advertisers to autonomously create campaigns and general users to make use of AI through AI Studio. Additionally, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s forward price to earnings ratio of 22.32 means that the share growth might be rapid.\nSince monetizing AI is one of the keys to Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s hypothesis, here\u2019s what Evercore\u2019s Mark Mahaney had to say during a\u00a0recent talk with CNBC:\n\u201cIf you look at what happened with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). they went to almost 30% revenue growth, they are growing dollar-wise faster than anybody else that\u2019s because they used AI to rebuild their ad-tech stack because they used AI to rebuild their user interface and get us more engaged, so it actually worked for them.\u201d\nOverall META ranks 5th on our list. While we acknowledge META's potential as an AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\nExciting new developments in the artificial intelligence space have continued to pour in over the past few days as the stock market recovers from a major tech selloff. Some of the most trending ones relate to electronics giant Apple, Microsoft-backed AI startup OpenAI, and software firm Adobe. Apple has doubled down on AI with the release of macOS Sequoia, which integrates AI features designed to enhance device performance and user experience. These AI enhancements include real-time content generation and AI-driven privacy tools. With iPhone sales slowing, Apple is banking on AI to reinvigorate interest in its devices, setting itself apart in an increasingly competitive tech market\u200b.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nOn September 13, OpenAI released the highly anticipated Strawberry model, which aims to tackle complex challenges in AI development, including more nuanced decision-making and language processing. This model is expected to advance the capabilities of OpenAI in both consumer-facing tools and enterprise applications. Similarly, Adobe is also making major moves with the Firefly AI video tools, set to debut by the end of 2024. These tools allow users to generate videos from text and images, offering functions like Generative Extend to enhance existing videos. This positions Adobe at the forefront of generative AI for content creation, with a focus on commercial safety by using licensed datasets.\nLooking ahead, Wall Street analysts project significant revenue and earnings growth for key players in the AI space, particularly in semiconductor companies that power AI applications. NVIDIA, for example, is forecast to achieve an impressive 27% annual revenue growth, outperforming both the semiconductor industry and the broader US market. The total revenue for the chipmaker in 2025 is expected to reach around $123 billion, with earnings projected to grow by over 24%\u200b.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other big company stocks.\nMega-cap stocks\u2014major technology companies to be precise\u2014continued to drive a disproportionate share of the total US stock market returns. Market experts believe that from 2023 beginning to May 2024 end, only a handful of the biggest and most well-established technology companies drove ~60% of the S&P 500\u2019s 40%+ gain.\nFactSet reported that, for 2Q 2024 (with 93% of S&P 500 companies publishing actual results), ~79% of the S&P 500 companies reported positive EPS surprises. On the other hand, ~60% of S&P 500 companies reported positive revenue surprises. In 2Q 2024, semiconductor companies\u2019 stocks were the critical drivers for the S&P 500 Index. The AI themes supported other sectors, like utilities, seeking support from higher electricity demand for AI data centers.\nWall Street experts believe that estimates for 3Q 2024 have seen a decline and the magnitude of estimate cuts seems to be significantly bigger than compared to the comparable periods of the first 2 quarters of 2024. Market participants opine that total S&P 500 earnings should see an increase of 3.9% from the same period of last year on 4.7% revenue growth. These estimates have come down since the beginning of the period, as the current 3.9% growth had fallen from 6.9% at the beginning of July.\nThe decline in estimates stems from the risks associated with economic downside, slower disinflation, expectations for higher-for-longer rates, and increased geopolitical risks. \u00a0Apart from these risks, the uncertainty around the US Presidential elections remains the most important factor responsible for the decline in estimates.\nWall Street analysts believe that uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election is expected to rise as the November vote draws closer. This can act as an additional headwind in the environment already demonstrating signs of losing momentum.\nReuters reported that populism, polarization, and an expected tight race can result in a surge in the economic policy uncertainty index (EPU). This is a news-headline-based index, which was created by economics professors Steven J. Davis, Scott R. Baker, and Nick Bloom. The rise in EPU takes place when an uncertain outlook about government policy prompts consumers to delay their spending and forces businesses to put a halt on investment and hiring.\nBrandywine Global Investment Management (A Franklin Templeton Company), an investment management firm, believes that this might be happening in the current environment. The firm noted that the University of Michigan's current economic conditions index remains below the expectations index. Notably, this is a rare occurrence, suggesting that consumers are anxious.\nAnalysts at Brandywine Global believe that this year's election cycle, whether warranted or not, continues to impact the US consumer, which in turn, is impacting the corporate sector.\nIn the 2020 follow-up working paper, Davis (the co-founder of the EPU index) and his colleagues revealed that the EPU index tends to increase by ~18% in the month of November during a Presidential election. When elections come close, and there is a winning margin of less than 5%, and polarized, the EPU index can jump by ~28% in election month.\nPolitical uncertainty can be a more powerful factor in asset prices, with investors focusing on the US Presidential elections. A JPMorgan survey revealed that investors continue to see political risk in the US and abroad as the top destabilizing metric for equities.\nAI fever coupled with strong earnings has supported broader equities in 1H 2024, and gains have been concentrated in technology and growth stocks. Analysts opine that some investors are still looking for areas of the market that have underperformed, and they expect that the recent rally in tech might spread into other sectors as well. Most investors welcomed the signs of a slowdown in inflation and moderation in growth. As a result, the US Fed has hinted to cut key interest rates. With uncertainties looming, market experts believe that investors should stick to the big stocks, which have a healthy track record of delivering strong gains.\nOur methodology \nTo select the 7 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy Now, we used the Yahoo Finance and Finviz stock screeners to filter stocks with biggest market caps from different industries.

(NASDAQ:META) appears to be well-placed for strong and stable growth over the medium term.\u00a0 Considering the company\u2019s capability to profitably monetize its network through advertising, the company should comfortably generate excess returns on capital for the foreseeable future.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s ad revenue per user continues to grow. This demonstrates that advertisers are seeing value in working with the firm. The company has strategically accumulated data about everyone via Facebook and/or Instagram accounts, which are benefiting the advertisers in some form or the other. In 2Q 2024, the company\u2019s average price per ad went up by 10% YoY. The company continues to incorporate AI technology into its various offerings and focuses on launching VR products, which should enhance user engagement and drive further growth in advertising revenue.\nIn 2Q 2024, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s advertising revenue increased $6.83 billion, or 22% on the YoY basis because of growth in ad impressions delivered and average price per ad. The growth in ad impressions delivered was mainly because of an increase in users and their engagement with the company\u2019s products.

We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company\u2019s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street\u2019s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels).

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other big tech stocks.\nBig tech has long been an immensely popular area to invest in when it comes to US stocks, and for good reason. Tech stocks, particularly those investing in AI and offering AI products, have been generating immense returns in 2024, with the second week of September bearing witness to their immense potential. This week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite posted their best returns for the entire year, and many tech stocks were part of the faction that made this possible. As a result, there's a huge rise in the popularity of AI and tech stocks. This is in stark contrast to market opinions on AI stocks, particularly during the first week of September, when many were very concerned that we are in an AI hypecycle that is bound to wind down soon.\nAltimeter Capital's CEO, Brad Gerstner, recently joined CNBC's \"Closing Bell\" to discuss trends shaping big tech right now. He noted that the pace of\u00a0 AI at present is faster than any other tech development seen before. He also added that many investors are starting to lean back into big tech ahead of the election. This development may be coming about because of the historical trend that suggests that stocks perform better in the months directly following a US election - in which case, it makes sense for investors to be piling into big tech and AI right now since that's a sure shot way to profit in the next few months.\nA recent notable trend that people have begun to see because of the rise of big tech companies and the growing use of AI is a greater demand for power. Many major tech companies are beginning to require more energy, with the AWS-owner going as far as buying a nuclear-powered data center for $650 million recently.\nThe primary driving force for this rising demand is the need to develop AI. Many energy-conscious investors may see this new trend as a red flag for big tech. However, Jensen Huang has noted that while AI takes a ton of energy to train, once developed and trained, it will also help save energy. He particularly noted that AI is going to become so advanced through this development that it will eventually end up offering solutions that can change the way we use energy, making our operations endlessly more energy efficient.\nWith this in mind, big tech seems to be quite an interesting space to follow right now, especially in the days leading up to the US Presidential Elections. As such, we've compiled a list of the best big tech stocks to buy right now.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nFor our list below, we selected big-tech stocks with the highest numbers of hedge funds holding stakes in them during the second quarter and then ranked them based on this metric in ascending order.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is Mark Zuckerberg's social media company that has gained immense fame over the past few decades. It is based in Menlo Park, California.\nSince Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a global leader in the internet economy, many investors are awed by the position it holds and the number of popular social media platforms it owns. Because of this, the company also has about 18% of the global market for digital advertising sales since its social media platforms enable it to generate huge amounts of ad revenue.\nAnother reason why Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is gaining investors is its focused approach to AI integration. This is one of the most aggressive companies when it comes to building a network infrastructure and computing power, and it has about $37-40 billion set aside to spend on AI just this year. Through AI spending, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) aims to enhance user experience on its platforms by adding greater functionality and boosting advertisers' ability to target their audience.\nWith all this, some may be wary about Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) intense spending habits. However, in the second quarter, the company announced a 38% operating margin and generated $10.9 billion in free cash flow. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ended the quarter with a net cash position of $40 billion - so many investors' concerns have been alleviated.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was spotted in the portfolios of 219 hedge funds in the second quarter, with a total stake value of $42.5 billion.\nRowan Street Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cWe are pleased to report that\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), our largest position in the fund, has delivered a remarkable performance, +450% since our November 2022 note. Our investment in Meta dates back to 2018, with an average cost basis of approximately $172 per share. Today, the stock trades around $535, reflecting a 3x return over the six-year holding period, equating to a 20% annualized return.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best big tech stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, we believe that AI stocks hold promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other American tech stocks.\nTech stocks have outperformed the stock market for several years and account for over 30% of the market's overall holdings. With market values estimated at trillions of dollars, the majority of the lauded Magnificent Seven stocks are American tech companies that are still expanding. Technology is constantly evolving, and investors have a lot of opportunities because of this ongoing advancement.\nThis dynamic progress was reflected in the US stock market when it rose more than 3% in the second quarter of 2024. In terms of the trade in artificial intelligence, technology companies remained at the top, and this trend did not appear to be slowing down throughout the quarter. The largest companies have outperformed the market this year, which has been a remarkable trend. The 500 largest companies' large-cap market saw gains of 4.4% in Q2 YoY, increasing its 2024 return to above 15%. In contrast, the small-cap market saw a 3.3% drop, translating into a 1.6% 2024 return.\nEven though technology companies outperformed in Q2 FY2024, Main Street Research's James Demmert cautions investors not to treat all of them the same. Instead, they should prioritize those tech firms that can deliver consistent earnings, especially in an uncertain economy.\nInvestors should also stay informed about the 2024 tech industry statistics. According to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, almost one-third of the growth in the US economy is attributed to the IT sector, which is the main driver of the country's economy. Similarly, the United States accounts for one-third of the world's information technology market, according to the International Trade Administration, making it the largest tech market in the world. Computer and IT jobs reported a median annual wage of $104,420 in May 2023, while 108,503 college graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer and information sciences graduated in 2022, a 3.5% increase YoY. The average yearly salary for tech majors is $90,000.\nAccording to a report, tech trends in 2023 were dominated by electrification/renewables and generative AI. Internet searches for generative AI increased by 700%, and the area received significant funding as huge language models processed more data and expanded modalities. Even while global IT investment declined, electrification and renewables continued to draw large amounts of capital. These industries continue to have a high volume of job postings, signifying potential for long-term growth.\nLooking forward, according to the Deloitte 2024 technology industry outlook, in the wake of current macroeconomic headwinds such as high inflation and supply chain disruptions, the technology industry confronts a cautious 2024 recovery. As per Deloitte's Q4 2023 study, 62% of tech executives believe the industry is \"healthy,\" with growth anticipated in the areas of cybersecurity, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. By late 2024, generative AI is expected to have a major impact on enterprise software and elevate operational efficiency. Tech companies and startups are investing more in AI, but enterprise adoption is still sluggish. However, this is predicted to change in the second half of 2024. Market expansion is anticipated to be propelled by enterprise expenditure on AI and IT services. Nonetheless, regulations in the EU and the US focusing on data privacy, sustainability, and AI ethics continue to provide challenges, forcing companies to follow regulations while leveraging these for competitive advantage. To reduce geopolitical risks and guarantee uninterrupted growth, supply networks will need to strategically change, and effective operations will need to be prioritized.\nWe sifted through holdings of tech ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 25 American tech stocks.

The company's top-line growth and cash flow are expected to be positively impacted by these priceless assets, and Morningstar analysts predict that advertisers will continue to spend more online.\nThrough its Reality Labs branch, META is making significant investments in the metaverse, VR, and AR technologies. However, the company has come under fire for making substantial payments to these new consumer platforms.\nThe company's price objective of $550 is maintained by BofA Securities, even though the company intends to reduce Reality Labs' hardware expenditure by 20% by 2026. The potential budget drop is viewed as a strategic response to falling demand for VR devices, even though consumer interest in AR glasses remains high.\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) posted a higher-than-expected profit of $13.5 billion in Q2 2024 raising its stock price by over 7%. Revenue for the latest quarter came in at $39 billion, which was 22% more than last year and exceeded market projections.

Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is the largest shareholder in the company, with 12,428,700 shares worth $6.27 billion.\nOverall META ranks 10th on our list of the best American tech stocks to buy according to short sellers.

One notable development is the rise of Safe Superintelligence, a company founded by previous OpenAI bigwig Ilya Sutskever, which recently secured $1 billion in funding to advance AI systems with a focus on safety. This significant capital raise from major venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital underscores the growing concerns around AI safety, as companies work to ensure that AI technologies are both powerful and aligned with human values.

Data centers are expected to require up to $2 trillion in investment globally over the next five years to meet the demands of AI technologies, and the AirTrunk acquisition signals strong confidence in this growth by top investment managers. Data center expansions are critical as companies like OpenAI and Anthropic roll out enterprise-grade AI services, which demand immense computing power.

Companies are investing billions in AI and they expect to see the results of their investments in the coming months and years. Analysts at UBS said in a report earlier this year that if the launch of ChatGPT was the \u201ciPhone moment\u201d for the AI industry, apps like Copilot signify the \u201cApp Store moment.\u201d\nUBS also increased its revenue estimates for the AI industry in the report by 40%. The firm said at the time that it now expects revenue in the AI industry to increase from $28 billion in 2022 to $420 billion in 2027. This would represent a CAGR of over 70%.\nUBS justified its growth projections by drawing an analogy from the past growth cycles of mainframes, smartphones and PCs.\n\u201cAnnual shipments for mainframes were only about 1mn units until the 1980s, when they ballooned to around 10mn as microcomputers became mainstream computing devices. This was followed by a sharp increase during the PC era, when annual PC shipments shot up to more than 100mn units, with PC shipments eventually reaching an annual run-rate of nearly 300mn. Smart devices, which include smartphones and tablet PCs, crossed 1bn shipments during the mid2010s. Currently, annual shipments are close to 1.5bn units.

Analysts across major research firms and financial institutions remain optimistic about the growth trajectory of AI, predicting sustained expansion through 2025 and beyond. For example, according to Gartner, the AI software market is expected to reach $135 billion by the end of 2025, reflecting a 21% year-over-year growth. This surge is driven largely by the adoption of AI in various sectors such as healthcare, finance, and retail. Research by McKinsey similarly indicates that AI could add as much as $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030, making it a critical driver of economic growth.\nA Bloomberg report also echoes these projections, highlighting that venture capital investment in AI startups has continued at a rapid pace, even amid broader economic downturns in technology. In the first half of 2024, over $40 billion in venture capital was funneled into AI-focused firms. Much of this funding targets generative AI, a subfield of AI that has gained attention for its ability to produce human-like text, images, and designs. According to a Goldman Sachs analysis, generative AI could boost global productivity by 7% over the next decade, contributing an additional $4.4 trillion to the global economy.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence has been the buzzword around Wall Street for many months but a recent selloff in the technology sector has ignited fears of an AI bubble. Investors are looking towards experts to help them make better investment decisions. In a recent commentary on the AI market, as well as the macro conditions surrounding the economy, the investment titan highlighted multiple factors contributing to market volatility, including recession concerns, pre-US election jitters, and profit-taking. Despite these, the investment firm noted, US corporate earnings have been resilient, with the S&P 500 showing 13% growth in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing expectations. The AI sector remained a key theme of this growth, but BlackRock relented that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech companies. In this environment, the investment firm recommended diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOverall, the wealth wizard advocated for broadening investment exposure beyond US tech stocks, particularly into sectors benefiting from ongoing AI buildout, while remaining cautious about Japanese equities and US short-term bonds. In the weekly commentary, the advisory highlighted that the US economy appeared more resilient than anticipated, with broad-based earnings growth suggesting stability. However, inflation remained a concern, and BlackRock expects it to limit how much the Federal Reserve can cut interest rates in the medium term. The investment firm noted that markets were pricing in significant rate cuts, but expectations seemed overblown given persistent inflation pressures, especially from wage growth. The investment titan suggested looking to European markets for income opportunities and remaining underweight on short-dated US Treasuries in favor of medium-term maturities and quality credit.\nThe investment firm also underlined the broader market backdrop in the weekly commentary, noting that US stocks fell due to recession fears, with the S&P 500 experiencing its largest weekly drop in 18 months. Treasury yields also declined as investors priced in expected Fed rate cuts. The advisory, however, viewed these recession fears as overstated, pointing to US jobs data that showed slowing but steady employment growth. Analysts at the investment firm maintained that wage gains were unlikely to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target in the near term but cautioned that the August Consumer Price Index (CPI) data would be crucial in determining inflation's trajectory. A surge in immigration had contributed to easing wage inflation, according to the financial firm's report, but the long-term labor supply trend would influence the Fed\u2019s ability to adjust rates.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. AI deployments have already started benefiting the fundamentals of the company, evidenced by the strong performance in the ad market in the second quarter of 2024. Investment advisory Cantor Fitzgerald has taken note of these developments, recently naming the company among a basket of firms that the advisory considers top picks in the internet sector for 2024, even after accounting for micro and macro level risks in the space on a global scale.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) earned an Overweight rating at Cantor Fitzgerald in a recent research report, where the advisory noted that the firm had plenty of levers to capture share gains as AI deployment could deliver incremental engagement, monetization, and revenue growth over the next 2\u20133 years. The advisory added that despite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names were fairly reasonable and would benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the most important AI stocks according to BlackRock. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Author": "  Noor Ul Ain Rehman ",
        "Text": "In this artice, we will look at the 8 Worst AdTech Stocks To Buy Now. Let's look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) stands against other worst adtech stocks.\nThe adtech industry includes an array of products and companies, including supply-side platforms (SSPs), demand-side platforms (DSPs), data management platforms (DMPs), ad exchanges, and more. According to data by Allied Market Research, the global adtech market stood at $748.2 billion in 2021, and is anticipated to reach $2.9 trillion by 2031. This translates to a compound annual growth rate of 14.7% between 2022 and 2031. Experts believe that the industry is well-poised for growth, with the global supply-side platform segment (SS) reaching a market size of $117.32 billion by 2033. Technological advancements, supportive government policies, and higher consumer demand are all factors expected to drive this growth.\nIn addition, changing trends such as the exponentially growing use of advanced technology like artificial intelligence and machine learning, growing Internet and digital penetration, growth of social media platforms and better prospects for the gaming industry, are all responsible for this growth. In-app advertising, interactive ads, and higher use of connected TV (CTV) have become the dominant trends in the AdTech industry, driving growth and change.\nTrends in programmatic advertising are also expected to improve, allowing the demand-side platform software market size to reach $120.1 billion by 2033. The demand for improved targeting and measurement capabilities for online ads is also an important factor to consider in this growth. While the AdTech industry seems promising on its own, the increasing use of artificial intelligence across all platforms is making it even more appealing.\nDespite its positive trends, the AdTech industry in the US is experiencing certain headwinds, the most prominent being Google\u2019s highly profitable AdTech business going to trial. The Department of Justice and a coalition of states filed a lawsuit against the company in 2023, claiming that the company is illegally dominating the digital ad marketplace, leveraging its market power to suppress competition and innovation. A trial began this month, and the Department of Justice rested its case against its parent company for operating a monopoly in the AdTech market. The tech giant earned more than $200 billion through the placing and selling of ads in 2023, arguing that the reason behind this success is the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of its services. Prosecutors, however, claim that the company has used its dominance to shun rivals.\nIn addition, smaller AdTech firms are raising concerns over Google\u2019s cookies alternative, Privacy Sandbox. While its ad business is under global scrutiny, the company is making adapting to Privacy Sandbox a critical necessity. However, regulators in the US and UK are of the opinion that the Privacy Sandbox would give Google the lion\u2019s share of control over the digital advertising market, which might negatively affect competition.\nPotential technology development delays seem to be negatively affecting smaller AdTech firms, changing the course of the industry. While conclusive results aren\u2019t out, such changes are highly likely to alter AdTech industry trends.\nOur Methodology\u00a0\nTo list the 8 Worst AdTech Stocks To Buy Now, we used the Finviz screener, ETFs, and rankings to first identify 15 AdTech stocks. Next, we narrowed our list by selecting the 8 stocks that have high short interest but also a high number of hedge fund investors. Finally, these stocks were ranked in ascending order of their short interest. We have also added the number of hedge funds holding each stock as a secondary metric.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n8 Worst AdTech Stocks To Buy Now\nShort Interest: 1.31%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) ranks seventh on our list of the worst adtech stocks to buy now, and is one of the leaders in the domain. The company builds technology that allows people to connect, find communities, share, and grow their businesses. Its products help people do all of this by connecting through personal computers, mobile devices, virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) headsets, and wearables. Advertisers also use the company\u2019s apps to expand their customer base and connect with customers\nMeta\u00a0 (NASDAQ:META) operates through two primary segments: Reality Labs (RL) and the Family of Apps (FoA). The RL segment includes mixed, augmented, and virtual reality-associated consumer software, hardware, and content. In contrast, the FoA segment includes globally famous apps: Instagram, Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Threads.\nAccording to the company\u2019s estimations, more than 3.2 billion people use at least one of Meta\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) apps daily. This growth is especially strong in the US, where WhatsApp now serves more than 100 million monthly active users. Year-over-year growth across Instagram, Facebook, and Threads is also strong, both in the US and across the globe. Threads is also on the path to hit 200 million monthly active users, thereby establishing itself as another major social app. These trends are primarily driven by the company\u2019s shift in focus towards users aged between 18 and 29.\nJumping on the AI bandwagon, Meta (NASDAQ:META) has plans to significantly modify its services for advertisers by employing artificial intelligence in the future. Advertisers who previously came to the company with a particular pre-selected target age group, interest, or geography would no longer need to do so, as Meta\u2019s (NASDAQ:META) AI-enabled ad systems would soon be better equipped to predict target segments. In the future, Meta (NASDAQ:META) expects to hand over the task of generating creatives for advertisements to AI as well, leaving advertisers to only contact the company with a budget and a vision.\nOn September 10, Meta (NASDAQ:META) was initiated with a Buy at DA Davidson. Its median price target of $524.6 implies an upside of 9.60%. 219 hedge funds hold stakes in the stock, with Citadel Investment Group holding the highest stake, worth $6.26 billion.\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2024\u00a0investor letter:\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world\u2019s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users across its platform. The company generates revenue predominantly from advertising, which accounts for over 95% of its total revenue, evenly split between North American and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal fourth quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings surpassing analyst estimates. The better-than-expected revenues were attributed to strong advertiser demand and Al-driven ad improvements. Moreover, the company materially raised its fiscal first quarter sales and earnings guidance above analysts\u2019 estimates, buoyed by continued strong advertiser demand trends and enhancements to Reels. Advantage+. Click-to-message, and Shop Ads. Further, management noted that ongoing investment in Al is enhancing user engagement and advertiser returns through improved targeting and measurement. Separately, Meta authorized a new share repurchase plan representing approximately 5% of its market capitalization and announced the initiation of its first dividend, implying an approximate 0.4% yield.\u201d\nOverall, META ranks seventh among the worst adtech stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of adtech companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Is Meta Platforms Stock A Buy?",
        "Author": "  Dan Victor, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has been a dream stock for investors, returning 90% over the past year and an even more spectacular 548% since its low in 2022, when shares briefly traded under $90.\nCompared to a disappointing slowdown after the worst of the pandemic, the social media giant reclaimed its operating and financial success by focusing on core strengths. An all-in approach toward artificial intelligence (AI) as a new growth driver has given shareholders plenty to cheer about.\nThe headlines are positive, but do they make the stock a buy today? Let's discuss whether the rally in Meta Platforms can keep going.\nMeta Platforms is globally recognized through its family of apps and platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, that help people around the world stay connected. Its vast user base and significant reach (3.3 billion daily active people) have proven highly attractive to advertisers.\nThe trends from Meta this year have been very impressive. In the fiscal second quarter (for the period ended June 30), total revenue climbed by 22% year over year, propelled by a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across the family of apps while the average price per ad was also 10% higher.\nA big part of the momentum is the impact of new AI features on advertisement performance. Improved ad targeting based on AI recommendations led to higher conversions for marketers, which in turn supports higher demand for advertising campaigns. Meta also rolled out AI tools like its MetaAI virtual assistant with text and image generation to keep users engaged.\nThese dynamics, with cost-controlling measures, translated into strong profitability. Q2 earnings per share (EPS) were up 73% from last year to $5.16 while free cash flow reached $11 billion.\nAccording to consensus estimates, Meta should grow revenue by 20% this year and maintain a double-digit pace into 2025 and beyond. Earnings should also climb even higher with margins benefiting from the improved AI scale.\nThere's a lot to like about Meta Platforms proving it can continue to innovate through artificial intelligence. The initiation of a $0.50-per-share quarterly dividend earlier this year solidifies it as a blue-chip stock. That said, it's also worth considering potential weak points in the company's profile that could represent risks down the line.\nOne area of concern is that the company hasn't been able to materially diversify beyond advertising. Meta does have the Oculus virtual reality headset line along with its recently prototyped Orion augmented reality smart glasses, but these products are not expected to be major growth drivers for the overall business any time soon.\nThis is in contrast to other \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks that have multiple different operating segments. For example, Alphabet is also a major internet advertising player through search but it has the YouTube video-sharing platform as well, along with the Chrome and Android operating systems.\nThe question mark is how exposed Meta Platforms would be during an economic downturn in which advertising pulls back. Other tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon\u00a0could prove to be more resilient.\nIn terms of valuation, shares of Meta Platform are trading at 27 times its full-year consensus EPS as a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This level represents a discount compared to Microsoft and Apple, which are above 32, but still a large premium compared to Alphabet, which is closer to 21. It's not clear that Meta is significantly over- or undervalued.\nMeta has everything in place to keep rewarding shareholders over the long run. Still, I believe a hold rating is prudent for now, balancing high expectations following what has already been a breathtaking rally this year. Patient investors may manage to scoop up shares of Meta Platforms at a lower price during the next round of volatility or find more compelling opportunities elsewhere in the market.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

The Style Scores can help you narrow down which stocks are better for your portfolio and which ones can beat the market over the long-term.\nMomentum investors, who live by the saying \"the trend is your friend,\" are most interested in taking advantage of upward or downward trends in a stock's price or earnings outlook. Utilizing one-week price change and the monthly percentage change in earnings estimates, among other factors, the Momentum Style Score can help determine favorable times to buy high-momentum stocks.\nMeta Platforms is the world\u2019s largest social media platform. The company\u2019s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta\u2019s family of products used by almost 3.24 billion people on a daily basis as of Mar 31, 2024.\nMETA is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, with a Momentum Style Score of A and VGM Score of B.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Meta Platforms (META), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry.\nThis social media company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 9.41%.\nFor the last reported quarter, Meta Platforms came out with earnings of $5.16 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.70 per share, representing a surprise of 9.79%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $4.32 per share and it actually produced earnings of $4.71 per share, delivering a surprise of 9.03%.\nFor Meta Platforms, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.\nOur research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +2% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.\nWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.\nMany companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.\nBecause of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Surely investors are wondering if another leg higher is in store for the social media pioneer\u2019s stock.\nTo address the plausibility of such, let\u2019s see what\u2019s been moving Meta's stock higher and gauge if there is indeed more upside in META from current levels.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAs illustrated in the EPS surprise chart above, Meta has surpassed the Zacks EPS Consensus for seven consecutive quarters posting an average earnings surprise of 12.61% in its last four quarterly reports.\nPointing to the company\u2019s increased probability, Meta most recently reported Q2 EPS of $5.16 in July which beat estimates by 10% and soared 60% from $3.23 per share in the comparative quarter.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nStemming from Meta\u2019s strong financial performance and further boosting its stock is that analysts have remained bullish on the tech giant\u2019s outlook. Notably, of the 45 brokers covering Meta\u2019s stock and providing data to Zacks Investment Research, 39 have a strong buy rating.\nMeta currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.33 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\u00a0\nIn regards to the positive sentiment, analysts have remained optimistic about Meta\u2019s opportunities in artificial intelligence. Hosting its annual conference today, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated Meta AI is one of the most used AI assistants in the world with nearly 500 million monthly users.\nThe \u201cMeta Connect 2024\u201d event was highlighted by new Meta AI updates including natural voice interactions outside of text. The AI voice interactions are now accessible on all of the company\u2019s main apps (Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Facebook) and will compete against Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL\u00a0Google Gemini Live and OpenAI\u2019s Advanced Voice Mode.\nMeta will also be expanding its business AI solutions to help businesses better serve their customers, offer support, and facilitate commerce. In\u00a0addition\u00a0to this, Meta unveiled updated versions of its virtual reality headset (Quest 3S VR ) and gave a glimpse of its Orion augmented reality glasses which it touts as the most advanced AR glasses ever made, combining the look and feel of regular glasses with immersive AR capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\nOne reason for the explosion in Meta shares has been the company\u2019s attractive valuation relative to many of its big tech peers. META currently trades at 26.3X forward earnings which is not a stretched premium to the S&P 500\u2019s 24.2X.\nFurthermore, META still trades at a sharp discount to its decade-long high of 74.5X forward earnings but slightly above the median of 25X during this period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAfter such a stellar year to date rally, Meta Platforms stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Although there could be better buying opportunities ahead it would be no surprise if META continued to rise with it noteworthy that the Average Zacks Price Target of $579.19 a share still suggests 3% upside.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We came across a\u00a0bearish thesis\u00a0on Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) on Kroker Equity Research\u2019s Substack by Kroker Equity Research. In this article we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on META. META Technologies, Inc. share was trading at $524.62 as of Sept 13th.\nMeta App 3D sign\nMeta Platforms Inc., formerly known as Facebook, remains a dominant player in the technology sector, focusing on social media and virtual reality. The company's key platforms include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, which are used by over 3.27 billion people worldwide. With its 2021 rebranding, Meta highlighted its ambition to lead the development of the \"metaverse,\" a series of virtual worlds facilitated by its Meta Quest hardware. This virtual reality push aligns with Meta\u2019s strategy to innovate beyond social media, but remains speculative and uncertain in terms of future returns.\nThe bulk of Meta's revenue comes from digital advertising, driven by its unparalleled user data, enabling highly targeted ads. This advertising dominance supports Meta's core business, with substantial profitability despite its ambitious investments in unprofitable ventures like the metaverse and evolving AI projects. Over the past five years, Meta's financial performance has been remarkable, with a 19.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in revenue and a 27% CAGR in earnings per share (EPS). The company is also debt-free and continues to generate strong free cash flow, balancing growth with large-scale share buybacks and dividends. Since 2019, Meta has repurchased $141 billion in shares, reducing its outstanding shares by 11%. This strong capital return strategy, combined with its first dividend payment in Q1 2024, makes Meta attractive to both income-focused and growth investors.\nHowever, Meta's stock price has surged over 300% since late 2022, raising concerns about its current valuation. Using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, Meta's fair value per share is estimated at $407, significantly below its latest stock price of $524. Even under optimistic growth scenarios, the stock appears overvalued. Meta's forward P/E and EV/EBIT ratios, which stand at 23.21x and 19.39x respectively, further support the notion that the stock is trading at elevated levels.\nIn conclusion, while Meta remains a high-quality company with substantial cash flow and leading social media platforms, its stock is currently overvalued. The company\u2019s heavy investments in the metaverse and AI are yet to demonstrate meaningful returns.\nMETA Platforms, Inc. is on our list of the\u00a031 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 219 hedge fund portfolios held META at the end of the second quarter which was 246 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the\u00a0cheapest AI stock.\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \u201cOpportunity\u201d for NVIDIA\u00a0and\u00a010 Best of Breed Stocks to Buy For The Third Quarter of 2024 According to Bank of America.\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is a Trending Stock",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (META) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +5.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 4.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $21.36 points to a change of +43.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.5%.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.10 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Meta Platforms.\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\nFor Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $40.08 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +17.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $161.62 billion and $184.04 billion estimates indicate +19.8% and +13.9% changes, respectively.\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $39.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.91%. The EPS surprise was +9.79%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "In the latest market close, Meta Platforms (META) reached $572.44, with a +0.9% movement compared to the previous day. This move outpaced the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.42%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.04%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.38%.\nComing into today, shares of the social media company had gained 8.83% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector gained 1.78%, while the S&P 500 gained 2.06%.\nInvestors will be eagerly watching for the performance of Meta Platforms in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company's upcoming EPS is projected at $5.15, signifying a 17.31% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $40.08 billion, reflecting a 17.38% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $21.36 per share and a revenue of $161.62 billion, representing changes of +43.64% and +19.8%, respectively, from the prior year.\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\nResearch indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.3% higher. Meta Platforms presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Meta Platforms has a Forward P/E ratio of 26.56 right now. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 30.96 of its industry.\nAlso, we should mention that META has a PEG ratio of 1.4. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. Internet - Software stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 2.05 based on yesterday's closing prices.\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 83, putting it in the top 33% of all 250+ industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in September.\u00a0Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nSam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, said while talking to CNBC in a latest program that since 1990, the market on average gains about 18% between the last rate hike and the first rate cut. However, during the 30 days after the first rate cut, the market historically \u201ctread water,\u201d gaining less than \u201cone half of one percent.\u201d\n\u201cMost of the action is below surface however, in the sectors, areas where a lot of the leaders be in the defensive areas but I have to add technology in there because investors don\u2019t want to be giving up on the growth,\u201d Stovall said.\nStovall pointed to another important historical data point regarding election years. He said that usually August and September are slow months in the stock market, but during election years the trend shifts to September and October, with markets historically rebounding in November and December once the uncertainty around the election subsides. The analyst recommended investors to position for a post-election rally which he believes buoys growth stocks.\nFor this article, we chose the top 10 AI stocks currently on investors\u2019 radar following important news, earnings and analyst ratings. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPhoto by Timothy Hales Bennett on Unsplash\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\nCantor Fitzgerald recently said in a note that Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) has \u201cplenty of levers\u201d to capture share gains. The firm added the stock to its top picks list and gave an Overweight rating.\nCantor Fitzgerald believes AI deployment can deliver incremental engagement, monetization, and revenue growth over the next 2\u20133 years.\nMeta Platforms Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0continues to gain attention from Wall Street analysts thanks to its explosive AI potential.\nD.A. Davidson analysts started covering Meta Platforms Inc\u00a0(NASDAQ:META)\u00a0with a \u201cbuy\u201d rating, naming it a top pick among mega-cap stocks. They believe Meta is positioned to lead in open source for two key tech platforms: AI Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute.\nD.A. Davidson analysts said that while past tech innovation was driven by startups, the scale and capital required for AI and Spatial computing mean only megacap companies can dominate. While companies like Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft are focused on closed platforms, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) leads the open-source side.\nThe firm praised Meta\u2019s open-sourcing of AI tools like Llama, PyTorch, and FAISS, which they say has positioned the company as the leader in AI foundational model compute. Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0advancements in AI have already improved ad delivery and returns, making it easier to justify its AI investments and open-source strategy.\nOn Spatial computing, D.A. Davidson pointed to Meta Platforms Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:META)\u00a0heavy spending on Reality Labs as strengthening its position as the open-source counterpart to Apple\u2019s closed ecosystem. They also commended CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s leadership in navigating challenges.\nDavidson set a price target of $600 for Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it\u2019s doing would bear more results in the future.\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company\u2019s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it\u2019s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year\u2019s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year\u2019s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company\u2019s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street\u2019s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta\u2019s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns.\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in September. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Meta unveils AR glasses prototype, Zuckerberg's 'time machine' to future",
        "Author": "  Katie Paul ",
        "Text": "By Katie Paul\nMENLO PARK, California (Reuters) -Facebook owner Meta Platforms showed off its first working prototype of augmented-reality glasses, called Orion, during its annual Connect conference on Wednesday, as the California company sketched out its aspirations for products that would bring the virtual world into the real one.\n\"This is the physical world with holograms overlaid on it,\" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said after pulling out the chunky black glasses from a metal case dramatically brought to him on stage.\n\"For now, I think the right way to look at Orion is as a time machine,\" he said. \"These glasses exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\"\nMeta also showed off new AI chatbot capabilities for its services and a new Quest mixed-reality headset. Meta shares registered a record closing high on Wednesday, up 0.9% at $568.31.\nThe Orion glasses are made of magnesium alloy and powered by custom silicon designed by Meta. Users will be able to interact with the glasses through hand-tracking, voice and wrist-based neural interface. Meta plans to work on making it smaller, sleeker and more low-cost before releasing it to consumers later on, Zuckerberg said.\nBig Tech has been developing AR devices for years, although the most notable ones have been failures, such as Google's Glass glasses.\nZuckerberg positioned AR technology as a sort of magnum opus when he first pivoted the world\u2019s biggest social media company toward building immersive \u201cmetaverse\u201d systems in 2021. Delivering products, however, has been hampered by high development costs and technological hurdles.\nPaolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said there was no doubt of Meta's aspiration to make virtual- and augmented-reality products as mass-market and affordable as possible. But he added that users were \"still wary of AI\" and needed some convincing.\nMeta aims to ship its first commercial AR glasses to consumers in 2027, by which point technical breakthroughs should bring down the cost of production, a source said before the event.\nZuckerberg did not demonstrate Orion's capabilities directly during his announcement, instead playing a video showing how people reacted to the device when they tried it. The video showed a few glimpses of text messages and images displayed through the glasses, and the CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, was prominent among the testers.\nThe closest thing to the prototype currently is the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which initially inspired little interest but caught on last year after Meta added an AI assistant. Meta announced AI enhancements to those glasses this year, making it possible for users, for example, to scan QR codes and stream music from Spotify in response to voice prompts.\nLater this year, the company plans to add video-generation capabilities and the ability to perform real-time language translation between English and French, Italian or Spanish. Zuckerberg held a live conversation with Mexican mixed martial arts fighter Brandon Moreno demonstrating the language tool, in which the glasses spoke translations from English to Spanish and vice versa.\nTENS OF BILLIONS SPENT\nMeta also announced a raft of other new product offerings for its ChatGPT-like chatbot, as well as plans to start automatically injecting personalized images created by the bot into people's Facebook and Instagram feeds.\nAmong the AI updates announced was an audio upgrade to the digital assistant, called Meta AI, which will now respond to voice commands and offer users the option to make the assistant sound like celebrities including Judi Dench and John Cena.\n\u201cI think that voice is going to be a way more natural way of interacting with AI than text,\" Zuckerberg said.\nThe company said more than 400 million people are using Meta AI monthly, including 185 million who are returning to it weekly.\nIn keeping with its strategy of sharing the AI models powering its digital agent for mostly free use by others, Meta released three new versions of its Llama 3 models, although it withheld the models from the European Union in light of regulations there.\nMeta also announced an entry-level version of its Quest line of mixed-reality headsets, the Quest 3S, which will start at $300, and cut the price of the Quest 3 introduced last year.\nThe company has been plowing tens of billions of dollars into its investments in artificial intelligence, augmented reality and other metaverse technologies, driving up its capital expense forecast for 2024 to a record high of between $37 billion and $40 billion.\nIts metaverse unit Reality Labs lost $8.3 billion in the first half of this year, according to the most recent disclosures. It lost $16 billion last year.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in Menlo Park, CaliforniaAdditional reporting by Yuvraj Malik, Aditya Soni, Shanima A and Jaspreet Singh in BengaluruWriting by Peter HendersonEditing by Shri Navaratnam, Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Augmented Reality Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other augmented reality stocks.\nAugmented reality (AR) is a technology that enhances our perception of the real world by overlaying digital elements through devices, adding to your existing environment. There are various ways to describe AR, from spatial computing to holographic projection, but its practical applications define its true value. A notable example of an AR device is the HoloLens, a holographic computer that enables users to interact with digital content within the real world, leading to its growing adoption across various industries such as education, manufacturing, and healthcare.\nDespite its applications and prospective growth, the AR space seems to have lost favor with venture capitalists, with investments declining due to disappointing adoption rates for the gear and leading metaverse platforms. Even the launch of the Vision Pro headset earlier this year, promoted as a \"spatial computing\" device, didn't significantly shift the mood. Reports suggest that demand for the $3,500 device is cooling, prompting the maker to lower its shipment forecast.\nSimilarly, the investment climate in the startup sector remains cold, with only about $464 million invested this year in seed through growth-stage funding for AR, VR, and metaverse-related companies. This sets 2024 on course to reach the lowest funding total in years. Most startups that raised large financings during the peak in 2021 haven't secured new rounds since. However, despite the slowdown, some notable deals have still occurred, with the largest AR-related round this year going to Rokid, a maker of augmented reality glasses, which raised $70 million in January. Another notable investment was in Beijing-based Xreal, a mixed-reality glasses maker that\u00a0 positions itself as a more affordable alternative to the Quest and Vision Pro, which raised $60 million in January at a $1 billion valuation.\nMost notably, Google recently partnered with augmented reality startup Magic Leap in a strategic technology deal, hinting that the tech giant may be preparing to re-enter the AR and VR market, a space it has mostly left to rivals. Over a decade ago, the search engine giant was a trailblazer in AR. This enthusiasm peaked during a 2012 demo where skydivers used the glasses to live stream a jump onto a building in San Francisco. However, the product faced significant consumer pushback due to its awkward design and privacy concerns.\nThe global augmented reality market, valued at $32.1 billion in 2022, is projected to grow from $42.85 billion in 2023 to $432.35 billion by 2031, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 33.5% over the forecast period, according to industry data from SkyQuest.\nA significant portion of the market is mobile AR, leveraging the widespread ownership of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices. As of this year, it's projected that there will be 1.7 billion devices capable of supporting mobile AR. Notably, a key advantage mobile AR enjoys is the massive existing smartphone user base. Unlike the steep challenges AR glasses face, mobile AR benefits from \"zero-cost\" hardware, making its path to adoption relatively smoother. Growth is expected across both enterprise and consumer segments, including digital AR experiences. A well-known example is the 2016 video game Pok\u00e9mon GO, where players explore their surroundings to find virtual characters on their phones. Additionally, collaborations between key market players and 5G providers to address latency issues are expected to fuel market growth.\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we reviewed online rankings and ETFs to determine 20 companies operating in the AR space. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey's database of 912 hedge funds, as of Q2 2024. Our focus was on companies that produce AR-related hardware, software, or technologies used in developing augmented reality products. However, we also included companies that offer services essential to the AR industry, like semiconductor chips.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has made a significant shift towards the metaverse, VR, and AR technologies in recent years. The company has ambitious plans in these areas, including the development of smart glasses, Quest headsets, and smartwatches. However, Reality Labs, Meta's division dedicated to VR and augmented reality innovations, has faced scrutiny due to its substantial financial investment in these emerging consumer platforms.\nDespite these concerns, BofA Securities has maintained a Buy rating for Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), with an unchanged price target of $550. This comes after reports suggested that Meta plans to reduce its investment in Reality Labs' hardware by about 20% through 2026. While Meta has not officially confirmed these budget adjustments, the potential cuts are viewed as a strategic response to the lukewarm reception of VR devices in the market, though there is a renewed interest in AR glasses.\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported a stronger-than-expected profit of $13.5 billion for the most recent quarter, boosting its shares by nearly 7%. Revenue for the April-June period reached $39 billion, surpassing market expectations and marking a 22% increase year-over-year. The California-based tech giant forecasts third-quarter revenue between $38.5 billion and $41 billion.\nAt the end of Q2 2024, 219 investors reported holding positions in META, with total stakes valued at $42.5 billion, a notable decrease from $46.9 billion in the previous quarter.\nAlger Focus Equity Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META) operates the world\u2019s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users across its platform. The company generates revenue predominantly from advertising. which accounts for over 95% of its total revenue, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal fourth quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings surpassing analyst estimates. The better-than- expected revenues were attributed to strong advertiser demand and Al-driven ad improvements. Moreover, the company materially raised its fiscal first quarter sales and earnings guidance above analysts\u2019 estimates, buoyed by continued strong advertiser demand trends and enhancements to Reels. Advantage+. Click-to-message, and Shop Ads. Further, management noted that ongoing investment in Al is enhancing user engagement and advertiser returns through improved targeting and measurement. Separately, Meta authorized a new share repurchase plan representing approximately 5% of its market capitalization and announced the initiation of its first dividend, implying an approximate 0.4% yield.\u201d\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the best augmented reality stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "Meta Platforms (NasdaqGS:META) is navigating a dynamic environment marked by both opportunities and challenges. Recent highlights include a strong Q2 revenue of $39.1 billion and significant advancements in AI technology, juxtaposed against rising costs and regulatory hurdles. In the discussion that follows, we will explore Meta's core advantages, operational challenges, growth opportunities, and external threats to provide a comprehensive overview of the company's current business situation.\nUnlock comprehensive insights into our analysis of Meta Platforms stock here.\nMeta Platforms boasts significant user growth, with over 3.2 billion daily active users across its apps, as highlighted by CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The company has also made notable strides in engaging young adults on Facebook, which is crucial for long-term growth. Advances in AI have significantly enhanced the quality of recommendations, driving user engagement. Financially, Meta Platforms reported a strong Q2 revenue of $39.1 billion, up 22% year-over-year, and an operating income of $14.8 billion, representing a 38% operating margin. The company\u2019s solid cash position, with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, further underscores its financial health. Additionally, Meta is currently trading below its estimated fair value of $730.92, making it an attractive investment despite its higher-than-industry-average Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 28.2x.\nMeta Platforms faces several challenges. The cost of revenue increased by 23%, primarily due to higher infrastructure and Reality Labs inventory costs, as noted by CFO Susan Li. Reality Labs, in particular, reported an operating loss of $4.5 billion, highlighting the financial strain of its ambitious projects. Additionally, total expenses for Q2 were $24.2 billion, up 7% compared to the previous year. Meta\u2019s Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 28.2x is considered expensive compared to the US Interactive Media and Services industry average of 25.9x. Moreover, the company's earnings forecast of 11.6% per year is slower than the US market's 15.2% growth rate, indicating potential underperformance relative to broader market expectations.\nMeta Platforms has several opportunities for growth and innovation. The development of AI technologies is expected to significantly enhance services for advertisers, as emphasized by Mark Zuckerberg. The expansion of Meta AI and the potential for a new major social app could open new revenue streams. Additionally, the future of business messaging, where every business might have an AI agent for customer interaction, presents a substantial market opportunity. The ongoing partnership with EssilorLuxottica to develop multi-generational smart eyewear products, such as Ray-Ban Meta glasses, is another promising avenue. The glasses have already seen high demand in various markets, indicating a successful product expansion.\nMeta Platforms faces several external threats that could impact its growth. Regulatory challenges are a significant concern, with increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in both the EU and the US, as highlighted by CFO Susan Li. The company is also dealing with intense competition in the AI space, which could limit the success of its proprietary technologies like Llama. Market risks are another concern, with expected year-over-year growth to slow in Q3 due to strong growth from China-based advertisers in the previous year. Additionally, the company is involved in multiple legal issues, including a $1.4 billion settlement with the State of Texas over biometric data misuse and a class action lawsuit alleging harm to minors from its social media platforms.\nTo gain deeper insights into Meta Platforms's historical performance, explore our detailed analysis of past performance.To dive deeper into how Meta Platforms's valuation metrics are shaping its market position, check out our detailed analysis of Meta Platforms's Valuation.\nMeta Platforms demonstrates a compelling mix of strengths and opportunities that position it well for sustained success. The company's impressive user growth and enhanced AI-driven engagement underscore its potential for long-term expansion, while its strong financial performance and substantial cash reserves highlight its solid financial health. Facing challenges such as increased costs and regulatory pressures, Meta's strategic focus on AI advancements and innovative product developments, like smart eyewear, offer promising avenues for future growth. Although Meta's Price-To-Earnings Ratio of 28.2x is higher than the industry average of 25.9x, it remains an attractive investment given it is trading below its estimated fair value of $730.92 and is relatively cheaper compared to peers with an average P/E ratio of 34.3x. This blend of solid fundamentals and strategic initiatives suggests a positive outlook for Meta's future performance.\nHold shares in Meta Platforms?

        "Text": "Meta Platforms (META) ended the recent trading session at $533.28, demonstrating a +1.65% swing from the preceding day's closing price. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.13%. At the same time, the Dow added 0.55%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.52%.\nHeading into today, shares of the social media company had lost 0.53% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.56% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.67% in that time.\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Meta Platforms in its forthcoming earnings report. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $5.15, marking a 17.31% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $40.08 billion, up 17.38% from the year-ago period.\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $21.36 per share and a revenue of $161.62 billion, signifying shifts of +43.64% and +19.8%, respectively, from the last year.\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms.

        "Title": "META vs. GOOGL: Which Magnificent Seven Stock Is Better?",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "In this piece, I evaluated two Magnificent Seven stocks: Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOGL). A closer look suggests bullish views for both. However, a clear winner does still emerge.\nOf course, Meta and Alphabet don\u2019t really operate in the same sectors. However, the fact that both have appeared in multiple stock acronyms over the years (remember FANG and FAAMG?) and are part of the so-called Magnificent Seven makes this comparison worthwhile.\nMeta Platforms owns several social media properties, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. However, the company has been attempting to reinvent itself into a metaverse company in recent years, touting the metaverse as \u201cthe future of digital connection.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Alphabet owns the Google search engine and many other properties. Thus, the company rakes in revenue from app sales via Google Play, purchases on YouTube, cloud services fees, online advertising, licensing, and even hardware like its Chromebooks and the Nest thermostat.\nIn terms of share price, Meta Platforms stock has surged 48% year-to-date and is up 72% over the last 12 months, although it is up only 4% for the last three months. In contrast, Alphabet stock is up a mere 8% year-to-date, accounting for nearly all of its 11% one-year return. Alphabet\u2019s lackluster year-to-date and one-year gains can be attributed to the shares\u2019 14% tumble over the last three months.\nDespite such a dramatic difference in their recent share-price performances, the gap between Meta\u2019s and Alphabet\u2019s valuations is not significant. However, the two companies don\u2019t address exactly the same industries. Thus, we compare each company\u2019s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to their own histories to gauge their valuations over time and determine which is the better Big Tech play.\nAt a P/E of 25.9x, Meta Platforms is trading at a small premium to Alphabet. However, the stock is on a steady downtrend on a P/E basis, although it\u2019s trading much closer to its 52-week high than its 52-week low. Nonetheless, the multiple compression grants Meta Platforms a long-term bullish view.\nMeta Platforms has certainly had its share of trouble since transitioning into a metaverse company. However, it\u2019s still raking in the revenue on its social media properties, notching $39.1 billion in revenue for the June quarter, up 22% year-over-year.\nAt the same time, Meta Platforms is developing artificial intelligence technology, aiming to build a nice in generative AI and develop the AI applications that will be used by the masses for years to come. Most importantly, Meta is using AI to guide targeting for its digital advertising and recommendations on its social networks.\nDespite these efforts, estimates suggest that Meta\u2019s AI initiatives may contribute only minimally to its revenue.\nHowever, analyst Deepak Mathivanan of Cantor highlighted Meta Platforms as a \u201ctop pick\u201d among internet stocks. While he acknowledged the limited revenue impact of AI efforts, he also pointed to the company\u2019s forward valuation. In fact, his estimates suggest a forward P/E of 20x FY25E earnings per share, which he said already embeds AI skepticism and provides room for potential upside for the shares.\nThus, I fully agree with this analyst\u2019s assessment, especially due to the current multiple compression we\u2019ve been seeing in Meta\u2019s P/E ratio. The recent peak of about 39x came in July 2023, and the company\u2019s P/E has been on a broader downtrend since then \u2014 despite its rising share price. \nMeta Platforms has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 41 Buys, three Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $584.82, the average Meta Platforms stock price target implies an upside potential of 11.27%.\nSee more META analyst ratings\nAt a P/E of 21.5x, Alphabet has a slight advantage over Meta in terms of valuation. In fact, Alphabet hasn\u2019t been this cheap on a P/E basis since March 2023. Thus, a bullish view seems appropriate.\nPut simply, Alphabet just looks too cheap to ignore at current levels. In fact, even excluding the cheapness of Alphabet\u2019s P/E, the stock hasn\u2019t been this cheap on a per-share level since March, indicating a buy-the-dip opportunity.\nAdditionally, Alphabet stock is slipping dangerously close to oversold territory with its Relative Strength Index of 32.5. As such, anything below 30 puts the stock in oversold territory and suggests an upside correction could be around the corner.\nFinally, Alphabet\u2019s 52-week range of about $120 to $192 is far less dramatic than Meta\u2019s range of $279 to $544, indicating greater stability in Alphabet shares. In a market with significant volatility, investors could certainly do with holding some stable and steadily growing shares in their portfolios.\nAlphabet has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 28 Buys, nine Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $203, the average Alphabet stock price target implies an upside potential of 35.27%.\nSee more GOOGL analyst ratings\nUltimately, neither Meta Platforms nor Alphabet will be going anywhere anytime soon. Thus, both look like long-term buy-and-hold positions with a permanent place in a long-term portfolio. However, Alphabet is offering a distinct buy-the-dip opportunity right now because it\u2019s too cheap to ignore. There hasn\u2019t been a better time to buy this stock in months, if not more than a year based on P/E.\nIn contrast, Meta\u2019s year-to-date gain makes its shares less attractive in the near term. Nonetheless, even at the current per-share price, investors are unlikely to lose money if they buy and hold for the long term.\nHence, both stocks receive bullish ratings, although Alphabet emerges as the clear winner.\nDisclosure\n"

        "Title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): A Magic Formula Stock You Should Pay Attention To",
        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Magic Formula Stocks For The Rest Of 2024.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other magic formula stocks.\nOne of the best known investment strategies on Wall Street, and one that's also followed by investing greats the like of Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group is value investing. Another fund manager who has delivered fantastic returns through a value based approach is Joel Greenblatt. Greenblatt currently runs the hedge fund Gotham Asset Management, a fund that he set up in 2008 after moving forward from his previous fund called Gotham Capital.\nGreenblatt is among the fund managers that have consistently delivered double digit percentage returns during their career on Wall Street. His previous firm, Gotham Capital, had an amazing run between 1985 and 1994. During this time period, the firm delivered a net return of 34%. This was particularly impressive, as 1985 was the year in which Gotham Capital was founded. On an annualized basis, the fund's returns were even stronger, since during the same period, Greenblatt's fund delivered 50% in returns.\nThe hallmark of a value investing strategy, as you'll understand if you study Warren Buffett's investment strategy in detail, is patience. This also applies to Greenblatt, who typically waits for at least a couple of years after making an investment to reap the returns. But while patience might be a virtue, on Wall Street, it's the returns that matter. On this front, Greenblatt hasn't disappointed, as his fund's blazing run in the 1980s wasn't its only one. After setting up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, the value investor managed multiple funds. Two of these were the Gotham Absolute Return (AR) fund and the Gotham Neutral fund. Among these, the AR fund was set up in 2012, and between then and 2018, its returns sat at 58.6%.\nHowever, while these returns are impressive, this period was filled with ups and downs for the investment vehicle. For instance, 2013 was one of the best years for this fund as it posted 29.82% in returns. These gains were trimmed down to 9.31% in 2014. While these weren't as strong as the previous year's performance, they were nevertheless in the green. This is important since the next year wasn't great by any account, since in 2015, the AR fund ended up with -10.25%. 2016 was somewhat turbulent for American stock markets since the Brexit vote in the UK, slowing Chinese GDP growth, and a commodities slump led to US and global stocks dipping between the end of 2015 and the first half of 2016. Between June 2015 and late February 2016, the blue chip Dow index had lost roughly 9% and the broader NASDAQ had bled a much higher 11%.\nThe next year would see Greenblatt bounce back. In 2016, the fund delivered 7.97% in returns and accelerated its performance later on through posting 10.03% in gains. During these same years, i.e., in 2014, the Gotham Neutral fund's annualized returns had sat at 6.83%.\nSince the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019, the stock market has been operating in a changed environment. The pandemic's immediate aftermath saw major stock indexes crash by 30%+, which then led to the Federal Reserve reducing rates to near zero levels. The subsequent low cost of capital, the boom in demand for consumer technology products, and the rise in retail investing then saw markets soar. During this time period, i.e., the bottom in March 2020 and the peak of December 2021, Greenblatt's AR fund was up by 55% while the flagship S&P index gained 103%. This might make you think that perhaps the investor, who calls his investment approach a 'Magic Formula' had lost its magic.\nBut you'd be wrong. The magic of the Magic Formula was visible during the next phase of the stock market. This was marked by the Federal Reserve's rapid interest rate tightening cycle that came in response to soaring inflation. Between December 2021 and October 2023, inflation continued to rise, as the interest rates took their sweet time to make a mark. This meant that the flagship S&P was down by 13.6% from 2021 close to the end of October 2023.\nHowever, during the same period, the AR fund had gained 3.41%. A short strategy had helped Greenblatt, it seems, as the AR fund advertises itself as being 50% to 60% net long. Gotham's pure play long fund, which is 100% long, led the S&P in losses during this time period as it had lost 15.52% during the same period and a stronger 27% from its peak in November start. However, the magic was visible between the March bottom and the November 2021 peak as during this period the 100% long fund had gained 97% to nearly match the flagship index.\nBefore we head to our list of the best Magic Formula Stocks, it's also important to take a brief look at what this investment technique entails. Greenblatt's strategy is based on two metrics, the return on capital employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. In a simple implementation, stocks are ranked according to these metrics, and the top stocks are bought and held for the long term. A specialty implementation is what Gotham calls its Gotham Yield. According to the fund, this is a proprietary technique that assesses a firm's \"pre-tax cash flow, return on capital, and enterprise value.\"\nOur Methodology\nTo make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy, we ranked the stocks present in Gotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 SEC filings by their dollar value and picked out the most valuable holdings.\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 219\nGotham Asset Management's Q2 2024 Stake: $49.2 million\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the parent company of Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. With roughly 3.2 billion people using its applications as of March 2024, it is one of the biggest social media and connectivity firms in the world. This provides Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) with a sizeable moat that reduces the pressure for growth on management. As a result, the key drivers of the firm's hypothesis include its ability to maintain the user base, increase average revenue per user, and introduce new products and services to monetize the user base. On these fronts, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has lately been implementing artificial intelligence into its products. The firm plans to use AI to enable advertisers to autonomously create their campaigns, and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is also setting itself up for AI monetization through its AI Studio which enables users on its platform to create their own AI. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s technology focused management and business has also allowed it to create its own AI model called Llama. This means that the firm does not have to license AI from others, such as OpenAI.\nEvercore analyst Mark Mahaney shared how Meta Platforms, Inc.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 AI News That Broke The Internet This Month.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks that broke the Internet this month.\nAI is transforming industries and reshaping the world by enhancing efficiency, driving innovation, and opening up new economic opportunities. A recent McKinsey report estimates that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy by 2030. The rapid growth of AI technologies \u2014 especially generative AI \u2014 has enabled organizations to streamline processes, automate complex tasks, and develop personalized services. In healthcare, AI is revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. For example, AI-powered diagnostic tools, such as those developed by Google Health, achieve accuracy rates that rival or surpass human doctors in detecting diseases like cancer. These advancements can reduce diagnostic errors and improve patient outcomes. Gartner predicts that by 2025, 50% of healthcare providers will invest in AI-driven technologies to improve patient care, underscoring the potential for massive growth.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nFinancial services are also being transformed by AI. According to a 2023 report from PwC, AI could increase global GDP by up to 14% by 2030, with financial services being a key driver. Banks and fintech companies are leveraging AI to enhance fraud detection, streamline customer service through AI chatbots, and offer personalized investment advice. Manufacturing is another sector experiencing rapid change due to AI. AI-powered robots are automating production lines, reducing human error, and increasing efficiency. According to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global sales of industrial robots are expected to reach $31 billion by 2025. These robots, coupled with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems, are lowering downtime and operational costs for manufacturers. Tesla, for instance, uses AI in its Gigafactories to streamline the production of electric vehicles, aiming to achieve greater sustainability and lower manufacturing costs.\nThe retail industry is embracing AI to optimize supply chains and enhance customer experiences. AI-driven recommendation systems, like those used by Amazon and Alibaba, have significantly improved customer satisfaction by offering personalized shopping experiences. A Forbes report suggests that AI could reduce supply chain forecasting errors by 50%, helping retailers better meet consumer demands. However, as AI adoption grows, so do concerns around job displacement. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI will replace 85 million jobs by 2025 but also create 97 million new roles, particularly in sectors like AI development, data science, and cybersecurity. This transition will require workers to adapt and reskill to remain relevant in the evolving job market.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected the most important AI news by combing through news articles, stock analyses, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Meta will use NVIDIA H100 GPUs for the cluster that features $2 billion worth of chips. It will train the Llama 4 large language model. Investment advisory Evercore ISI claims the deal would represent a $250 million revenue opportunity for Arista Networks. At the annual Meta Connect event held this month, Meta unveiled new versions of Llama, augmented reality Orion glasses, and mixed-reality product Quest 3s.\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks that broke the Internet this month.

        "Title": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Meta Platforms Next?",
        "Author": "  Anders Bylund, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is soaring. The stock is trading at all-time highs after rising 91% in the last 52 weeks. It also commands a beefy stock price at $565 per share. Is this \"Magnificent 7\" stock headed for a stock split in the near future?\nLet's start with the basics. A stock split simply changes the number of shares that represent a company's total market value. 10 million shares worth $100 each adds up to a $1 billion market capitalization. 100 million shares priced at $10 per share works out to the same market cap. Changing the ratio neither adds nor destroys value for existing shareholders.\nThat said, stock splits aren't completely pointless. A lower share price can make the stock more easily accessible to investors with modest budgets, especially if they don't have a brokerage account that supports buying or selling a fraction of a full share. The price per share can also make a difference for stock options, where a standard contract represents the right to buy or sell 100 shares at a specific price.\nThat adds up in a hurry when stock prices are high. For example, an \"in the money\" call option contract for Meta stock is worth about $56,500 today. That's not pocket change for most people, and enough to make large corporations think twice about compensation policies based on stock options.\nMeta makes heavy use of stock-based compensation. The company calls it share-based compensation in its financial filings, amounting to $8.2 billion in the first half of 2024. That's 17.5% of Meta's total operating costs, up from 16.2% in the first half of 2023. So Meta should manage its stock price to control its share-based compensation expenses, right? It's tough to provide fair wages to each worker when a single options contract is worth more than $50,000, after all.\nBut Meta has dodged that issue by doling out stock-based compensation in a different way. Besides their ordinary cash paychecks, Meta employees are paid in restricted stock units (RSUs). These are single shares, not large option contracts. Over time, the units convert into regular shares that can be sold on the open market.\nSo the stock-based compensation program won't force Meta's hand into splitting the stock. The company still has fairly granular control over its total wages at these stock prices.\nI could also argue that Meta should split its stock if it ever wanted to become a part of the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) market index. It's a price-weighted index, giving high-priced components a larger influence over the total index value.\nThe current prices among the 30 Dow components range from $22 to $574 per share. Dropping Meta Platforms in that mix would instantly match the most influential piece of that market puzzle, accounting for roughly 8% of the index score.\nBut the tech sector already has plenty of representation in that index, including fellow Magnificent 7 stocks Apple and Microsoft. Adding another tech heavyweight like Meta to that list would arguably tilt it too heavily in the direction of Silicon Valley.\nSo the Dow doesn't seem like a reasonable motivation for splitting Meta's stock, either.\nMeta Platforms isn't desperate to join the Dow Jones index. A lower share price wouldn't grease the gears of its stock-based compensation program. A stock split would perhaps boost the stock very briefly, as these moves generally indicate that the board of directors expects stock prices to rise even further. But I already mentioned that the stock is surging to record highs and really doesn't need an artificial short-term boost from that type of announcement.\nThe company could do it anyway to keep up with the cool kids and perhaps get a temporary price bump from the resulting media coverage. But Meta Platforms has no serious reasons to take that step, and I'm not holding my breath for that press release. The company hasn't split its shares after 14 years on the public markets, and I don't see why that should change in 2024.\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Microsoft wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the ChatGPT Stock Advice: 10 Recent Stock Recommendations.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks recommended by ChatGPT.\nChatGPT has quickly become an essential tool for both professional and personal use, thanks to its human-like responses. Analysts are also exploring its potential for stock picking, using criteria like low P/E ratios to find undervalued stocks. While some question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, a study from the University of Florida suggests that ChatGPT can predict stock price movements more accurately than some basic analysis models.\nOpenAI recently made a major leap by launching GPT-4o, a new AI model, alongside a desktop version of ChatGPT and an updated user interface. This update brings GPT-4 to all users, including those on the free tier, with enhanced speed and capabilities in text, video, and audio. The \"o\" in GPT-4o stands for \"omni,\" indicating its ability to support 50 languages and be available via APIs, allowing developers to start building applications with the new model right away.\nThe S&P 500 and NASDAQ are on track for their tenth consecutive positive session, driven by the same bullish factors that have propelled the market throughout the year. Inflation continues to trend downward, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. This potential for rate cuts supports the market by fostering conditions that could lead to a soft economic landing.\nEd Clissold, Ned Davis Research chief U.S. strategist, told CNBC that quarterly earnings growth has consistently accelerated over the past few quarters, with Q2 showing strong results and Q3 expected to follow suit. This steady growth suggests no significant changes in the underlying market thesis, keeping investor sentiment positive.\nDespite the recent volatility seen in August, which was partly driven by a spike in market uncertainty and liquidity issues, analysts do not expect this to carry over into September. The possibility of rate cuts by the Fed is providing a solid foundation for the market, though there are some concerns about elevated earnings estimates for Q3 and the upcoming election.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is close to an all-time high, with stocks like Travelers, Boeing, and 3M leading the charge. Analysts predict a broad market advance, with potential for catch-up in sectors that have lagged behind this year. As interest rates are likely to come down, the market rally could broaden beyond just AI and mega-cap growth stocks.\nLooking ahead to next week, key economic data will be in focus, including PCE data on Friday and consumer spending insights on Tuesday. Investors are hoping for \"Goldilocks\" economic data\u2014not too hot, not too cold\u2014that would confirm the Fed's rate cut path without signaling an economic downturn. The market favors moderate economic growth, which would support continued stock market gains.\nIn a world overwhelmed by information, ChatGPT offers a solution for investors. Its natural language processing capabilities allow it to sift through vast amounts of data and provide concise, actionable summaries, helping investors make informed decisions. By reducing information costs and democratizing financial knowledge, ChatGPT is becoming an invaluable tool for individual investors.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article we prompted ChatGPT multiple times to recommend stocks, based on the data as of its knowledge cutoff date. ChatGPT recommended 10 stocks based on \u00a0\u201chistorical trends\u201d and the \u201cmarket landscape\u201d from various sectors which have \u201csubstantial\u201d potential over the next few years. We shortlisted the stocks that were recommended the most and then further selected the ones that were the most widely held by hedge funds. We have sorted these stocks based on the number of hedge fund investors as of Q2 2024.\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) recently exceeded analyst expectations in its latest quarterly earnings, signaling that its significant investment in AI is beginning to pay off and could lead to even more positive outcomes in the future. In response, Citi expressed an \"incrementally positive\" outlook on Meta's shares, citing improved user engagement, monetization, and expanding profit margins. As a result, Citi raised its price target for META from $550 to $580.\nJPMorgan also highlighted the benefits of AI for Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) at three key levels: enhancements to its core Family of Apps (FoA), new opportunities and user experiences, and the scaling of the Metaverse. Consequently, JPMorgan raised its price target for META from $480 to $610. Additionally, Morgan Stanley praised Meta's advancements in its recommendation systems and overall quality through AI improvements.\nWhile the market has been cautious about Meta's substantial AI spending, the company aims to leverage AI to enhance user interactions, improve engagement, and better monetize its vast user base of 3.2 billion daily active users. With a robust free cash flow margin of around 30%, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) is on track to generate $50 billion in free cash flow this year, which would place the stock at approximately 26 times this year's free cash flow. If this growth continues, Meta could achieve $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, reducing the stock's valuation to 21 times next year's free cash flow.\nWith a strong financial position, including $35 billion in net cash, a massive user base, and a leading role in the AI-driven consumer market, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) is positioned as a solid long-term investment opportunity.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of ChatGPT's recent stock recommendations. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned -3.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 4.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $5.14 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $21.36 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +43.6%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.07 indicates a change of +12.7% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $40.08 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +17.4%. The $161.62 billion and $184.01 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +19.8% and +13.9%, respectively.\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $39.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +22.1%. EPS of $5.16 for the same period compares with $3.23 a year ago.\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.34 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.91%. The EPS surprise was +9.79%.\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Text": "Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg showed off some impressive upgrades to the company's hit Ray-Ban Meta Glasses during the company's Meta Connect event on Wednesday, including the ability to translate live conversations, offer continuous talking features, and recognize the world around you.\nThe updates make the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, which start at $299, a far more intelligent piece of technology \u2014 and give them similar features to smartphone-based AI apps like Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) Circle to Search and Gemini and Apple's (AAPL) upcoming improved Siri and visual intelligence.\nAccording to Meta, you'll now be able to do things like ask the glasses to remember where you parked. Or, if you want to know about landmarks in a city you're visiting, the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses can tell you more about a statue, building, or location when asked. At the grocery store and want to know what to make for dinner? Meta says the glasses can suggest what you should make based on what you're looking at while walking the aisles.\nThe company also says it's adding real-time translation to the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses. Zuckerberg showed off the feature during a live demo. And while there was a small delay between when a person stopped talking and the glasses began translating, it certainly appeared to work well. In fact, live-translating a conversation with the glasses looks far more natural than doing the same thing while holding up a smartphone.\nFinally, Meta showed off a new limited-edition transparent design for the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses that lets you see the device's internal components. It gives the glasses a late-90s/early-2000s look that more tech companies should adopt. (Says the guy who grew up during that time.)\nIn addition to updates for the Ray-Ban Meta Glasses, the company also announced its first AI vision models. The new open-source models, called Llama 3.2 11B and 90B, are designed to be able to understand images like charts and graphs.\nThe idea is to give developers the ability to create apps using the new models that can, for example, provide a hiker with information about when a particular hike gets steeper by having the AI read over a map of the route.\nMeta's AI work has quickly made it one of the top open-source AI companies around. And if it can keep on innovating, it could stand among the biggest beneficiaries of the AI revolution.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "Text": "In the latest market close, Meta Platforms (META) reached $512.74, with a +0.19% movement compared to the previous day. The stock's performance was ahead of the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.16%. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.09%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.3%.\nThe the stock of social media company has risen by 3.58% in the past month, leading the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 1.63% and undershooting the S&P 500's gain of 3.64%.\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Meta Platforms in its upcoming earnings disclosure. On that day, Meta Platforms is projected to report earnings of $5.14 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 17.08%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $40.08 billion, indicating a 17.38% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $21.30 per share and revenue of $161.62 billion. These totals would mark changes of +43.24% and +19.8%, respectively, from last year.\nAny recent changes to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms should also be noted by investors. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This denotes a discount relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 29.35.\nMeanwhile, META's PEG ratio is currently 1.26. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Internet - Software industry was having an average PEG ratio of 1.92.\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 94, placing it within the top 38% of over 250 industries.\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Meta (META) is rolling out a new, less expensive version of its pricey Meta Quest 3 mixed-reality headset. Unveiled during the company's annual Meta Connect event, the Meta Quest 3S offers the same functionality as the Meta Quest 3 with a starting price of $299. Meta is also dropping the price of the Quest 3 from a whopping $649 to $499.\nThe Quest 3S sports the same full-color mixed-reality capabilities as the Quest 3, albeit with a narrower field of view and a different overall design. Meta says the Quest 3S also runs on the same Qualcomm (QCOM) Snapdragon XR2 gen. 2 chip found in the Quest 3.\nAs the company rolls out the Quest 3S, it's also doing away with its older Quest 2 and pricier Quest Pro headsets.\nMeta is positioning the Quest 3S as its entry-level headset for consumers who are just getting into mixed-reality apps and those looking to upgrade from older Quest models. The Quest 3, then, is geared toward consumers who are already mixed-reality fans and are willing to shell out the cash for Meta's top-of-the-line features.\nMeta says the Quest 3S is compatible with the company's entire library of apps and games and will support upcoming titles like \"Batman: Arkham Shadow.\"\nMeta, however, isn't the only name in the headset business. Apple (AAPL) also sells its Vision Pro mixed-reality device, though, at $3,499, it's far more expensive than Meta's offerings. Apple hasn't provided insights into the device's sales performance.\nMixed-reality headset sales have faced a tough road as of late. According to IDC, worldwide shipments of augmented and virtual reality headsets fell as much as 28% year over year in the second quarter to 1.1 million units.\n\"In recent quarters, mixed reality (MR) headsets took a leap forward in fidelity, first with the launch of the Quest 3 and later the Vision Pro,\" Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, wrote in a release.\n\"However, the lack of affordable options has meant that few consumers have experienced this new technology.\"\nBut the Meta Quest 3S could start to turn the tide thanks to its relatively low price point. IDC said headset shipments are expected to increase from 6.7 million units in 2024 to 22.9 million in 2028.\nWhile that's a solid improvement for the headset business, it's still a far cry from the hundreds of millions of smartphones sold each year. Headsets also have to contend with strong competition from the gaming industry, including from console makers like Nintendo (NTDOY), which is expected to launch its next-generation console in 2025, and Sony (SONY), which is preparing to ship a high-powered version of its PlayStation 5 this fall.\nMeta is also struggling to make a profit from its vast augmented reality investments. The company recorded a $16 billion loss in the segment for 2023, up from $13.7 billion in 2022, and expects that to increase in 2024.\nStill, as the leader in the mixed-reality space, Meta could be the company to truly push the industry forward.

        "Text": "DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria initiated coverage on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) with a Buy rating and a price target of\u00a0$600.\nLuria noted Meta Platforms as a top pick within the mega-cap space, with a combination of emerging leadership in the most critical future technology platforms and an attractive relative valuation.\nThe analyst said Meta Platforms has skillfully positioned itself as the open source leader for major technology platforms: AI Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute.\nUnlike previous revolutionary innovations, Luria noted that a mega-cap could only win these two future platforms.\nWhile previous technology innovation was driven by nimble startups, AI and Spatial Computing require unprecedented scale, reach, and capital, the analyst said.\nWhile Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) are crowding into the closed garden side of these platforms, Meta Platforms has the pole position on the open side, Luria noted.\nThe analyst expects the closed-garden side of the AI compute platform to be an expensive fight between the Big Techs, but he noted that Meta is almost entirely alone on the open-source side.\nGoogle will need to manage the headwind of transitioning to AI-enhanced Search, Meta is already reporting how the advancements in AI are driving better ad delivery and yields, Luria flagged.\nIn spatial computing, the analyst expects the tens of billions Meta Platforms have poured into Reality Labs to become the moat that positions Meta Platforms as the open-source winner alongside Apple\u2019s closed garden.\nThe analyst said Meta exemplifies the benefits of being led by its founder more than any other mega-cap, including Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\nLuria\u2019s price target represents 24x 2025 EPS, a premium to Alphabet based on better positioning. The analyst noted that at 21x, Meta Platforms, aside from Alphabet, is the least expensive mega-cap, even before factoring in the option to sever Reality\u00a0Lab\u2019s losses, which would take the multiple down to 16x, thus providing downside protection.\nFor Meta Platforms, Luria projected third-quarter revenue of $40.2 billion and EPS of $5.25.\nPrice Action: META stock is up 0.30% at $506.30 at the last check on Tuesday.\nPhoto by Frederic Legrand \u2013 COMEO on Shutterstock\nDate\nFirm\nAction\nFrom\nTo\nJul 2020\nDesjardins\nInitiates Coverage On\nBuy\nView More Analyst Ratings for META\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\nThis article Meta Exemplifies Benefits Of Founder Leadership More Than Any Other Mega Cap Including Nvidia: Analyst originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "Author": "  Aniruddha Ganguly ",
        "Text": "Meta Platforms META shares have returned 7.6% in the past month, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 9.7% and the Zacks Internet Software industry\u2019s appreciation of 12.5%. Except for Amazon AMZN, it has outperformed the rest of \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d over the same time frame.The social media giant seems to have lost some shine in recent times, which can be attributed to increasing AI fatigue among investors. Technology stocks, including META, have been benefiting from a strong AI-fueled rally, which, however, seems to be losing steam due to rising weariness and skepticism over AI\u2019s continuous hype and promises.In fact, the Magnificent 7 group, which includes Google and YouTube parent Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft, NVIDIA NVDA, Apple and Tesla TSLA apart from Amazon and META, is facing headwinds from the cooling-off in AI-fueled rally.The question now arises for investors - are META\u2019s AI initiatives good enough to drive share price higher in the rest of this year? Let\u2019s analyze.\nAI is heavily dependent on data, of which META has a trove driven by its more than 3.2 billion daily users. Meta Platforms has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and Facebook.Its staggering reach and increasing ad impressions (up 10% year over year in second-quarter 2024) make META one of the most important players in the digital ad sales market apart from Alphabet.META\u2019s advertising revenues (99% of Family of Apps revenues) increased 21.7% year over year to $38.33 billion and accounted for 97.9% of second-quarter revenues. At constant currency, revenues increased 23% year over year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMETA is facing regulatory issues related to data privacy and security globally. Its business model relies on the collection, storage and utilization of vast amounts of personal data that raises questions about consent and transparency. Increasing regulatory headwinds have been a constant bother for META investors.Meta Platforms is aggressively spending on developing AI infrastructure and now expects to spend between $37 billion and $40 billion on these efforts in 2024. This should not be a concern for investors given its strong cash balance of $58.08 billion as of June 30, 2024.Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\nMeta Platforms is leveraging AI to boost Facebook\u2019s appeal among young adults (18-29-year-olds), a demography that used to prefer Alphabet\u2019s YouTube and Snapchat. META is incorporating AI tools into WhatsApp to make businesses more customer-oriented.\u00a0It has started rolling out Meta AI and is on track to achieve its goal of becoming the most used AI assistant by the end of the year. Meta AI is currently available in more than 20 countries and eight languages. In the United States, Meta Platforms is rolling out new features like Imagine edit, which allows people to edit images they generate with Meta AI.META\u2019s Llama family of foundation models has been a game changer. The latest Llama 3.1 includes the first frontier-level open-source model, as well as new and industry-leading small and medium-sized models. It is already working on Llama 4, which is expected to boost META\u2019s capability in the long run.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $21.23 per share, up 3.3% over the past 30 days, indicating a 42.77% year-over-year increase.The consensus mark for third-quarter 2024 earnings is pegged at $5.12 per share, up 5.3% over the past 30 days, indicating a 16.63% year-over-year increase.\nHowever, META stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of C suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.In terms of the forward 12-month Price/Sales ratio, META is trading at 7.32X, higher than its median of 7.08X and the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s 2.52X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMETA\u2019s growing footprint among young adults driven by improving recommendations boosts competitive prowess. AI usage is making it a popular name among advertisers that is expected to drive top-line growth.However, monetization of its AI services is expected to take several years, which investors should keep in mind before investing. Rising regulatory concern is a significant concern.META currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggesting that it may be wise to wait for a more favorable entry point in the stock.

        "Title": "All eyes are on Meta's smart glasses, but questions persist over its secretive AR project",
        "Author": " Yasmin Khorram    \u00b7 Senior Reporter",
        "Text": "Halfway through the keynote speech during the Meta (META) Connect event on Wednesday, vice president of augmented reality, Alex Himel, walked on stage with a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist.\n\"This is Orion,\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced next to him, pulling out Meta's augmented reality glasses. \"Our first fully functioning prototype \u2014 and, if I do say so, the most advanced glasses the world has ever seen.\"\nInvestors finally got a sneak peek of a moonshot from the money-losing Reality Labs division inside Meta. The project has been shrouded in secrecy after nearly a decade of development and billions of dollars in research and build. It also arrives as Wall Street increasingly questions the spending at the division, as it has burned through over $50 billion since 2020.\nZuckerberg hopes Orion can bridge the gap between the digital and real world and eventually replace smartphones. But its debut may be further away than Meta bulls think.\nMeta has previously said it's targeting 2027 to begin shipping its long-awaited AR glasses. Yet several insiders who worked on the teams building Orion exclusively told Yahoo Finance that despite the product being \"magical\" and \"precious,\" it may never hit consumers' hands or give a return to Meta's investment.\nAccording to two former engineers with knowledge of the project, the initial goal was to build approximately 1,000 units, which quickly turned into only a few hundred. Out of those, people familiar with the project estimate fewer than twenty units actually turn on and show a quality image \u2014 taking the average cost of just the working prototypes into the \"hundreds of thousands\" of dollars.\nZuckerberg's expectation was for some of the materials used to build Orion to drop in price over the last few years. That didn't happen as hoped (partly due to trade restrictions), meaning some of the materials will have to be changed for future versions to be financially sustainable.\n\"They don\u2019t know whether the technology will work and whether it\u2019ll ever work at the price point anyone can afford,\" said a former lead engineer who asked not to be identified. \"Right now, they don't have material that they can make this with at a reasonable cost.\"\nOrion is made up of three main parts: the glasses, a wristband, and a puck that powers the device's graphics and connectivity. The puck is referred to as the \"central compute,\" people familiar with the project said.\nIts chief materials are a silicon carbide wave-guide sandwiched between two protective lenses, seven cameras, two micro-LED projectors, and custom silicon \u2014 one of the more expensive parts of the product.\nThe glasses also feature magnesium frames to help keep the weight down. According to people familiar with the project, the wave-guides each cost around $10,000.\nZuckerberg is aware of the challenges ahead. He ended his keynote by saying Meta is focused on key changes to Orion before it offers it as a consumer product.\n\"For now, I think the right way to look at Orion is a time machine,\" Zuckerberg said. \"These glasses exist, they are awesome, and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\"\nIt remains to be seen how committed Zuckerberg and Meta are to Orion. Former employees tell Yahoo Finance that Meta moved a significant portion of its AR development team from the Orion project into its Ray-Ban smart glasses division earlier this month.\nAnd investor questions on the overall outlook of Reality Labs are mounting. A dozen former high-level employees previously told Yahoo Finance the division has been mired in mismanagement.\nIn a new note out Thursday following the event, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth projected Reality Labs losses of $19 billion in 2024 and $23 billion in 2025.\nReality Labs lost $16.1 billion in 2023, according to company filings, while contributing less than $2 billion to revenue. By comparison, the company's Family of Apps segment \u2014 which includes Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp \u2014 pulled in $62.9 billion in profits.\n\"The potential for Meta to pull back on Reality Labs spending and losses has been a frequent topic in our recent discussions with investors. And while it\u2019s difficult to discern between a shift of a few billions dollars, we don\u2019t come away from Connect thinking that Meta will pare back Reality Labs losses,\" Anmuth said.\nYasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "Title": "Meta unveils cheaper VR headset, AI updates and shows off prototype for holographic AR glasses",
        "Author": "  BARBARA ORTUTAY ",
        "Text": "MENLO PARK, California (AP) \u2014 Meta unveiled updates to the company's virtual reality headset and Ray Ban smart glasses on Wednesday as it tries to demonstrate its artificial intelligence prowess and the next generation of computing platforms beyond smartphones and computers.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg also showed off Orion, a prototype he called \u201cthe most advanced glasses the world has ever seen.\u201d\n\u201cThe technical challenges to make them are insane,\u201d Zuckerberg told a crowd of developers and journalists at Meta's Menlo Park, California, headquarters. The holographic augmented reality glasses, for one, needed to be glasses \u2014 not a bulky headset. There are no wires and they have to weigh less than 100 grams (3.5 ounces), among other things. And the beyond interacting with your voice, typing or hand gestures, Orion has a \u201cwrist-based neural interface\u201d \u2014 it lets you send a signal from your brain to the device, using a wristband that translates nerve signals into digital commands.\nThere is no release date for Orion \u2014 Zuckerberg called it a \u201cglimpse of the future.\u201d\nSeemingly in his element speaking to a cheering crowd, Zuckerberg said Meta is working to \u201cbring the future to everyone\u201d with its headsets, glasses and AI system. As part of an update to its Llama model, people will now be able to interact with Meta AI by speaking, with voices from celebrities such as John Cena, Judi Dench and Awkwafina.\n\u201cWe are trying to build a future that is more open, more accessible, more natural, and more about human connection,\" Zuckerberg said. \u201dThis is the continuation of the values and ideas that we have brought to the apps and technology that we have built over Meta\u2019s first 20 years.\u201d\nAn AI update aimed at influencers allows them to craft AI versions of themselves \u2014 for interacting with fans. On the keynote stage, an AI version of creator Don Allen Stevenson III appeared on the screen and answered a few questions just as the actual creator would. When Zuckerberg asked the AI creator about cattle ranching, it responded \u201cmy expertise lies in technology and design, not agriculture.\u201d An earlier version of this tool was text only.\nOther AI updates include live translation, which Zuckerberg demonstrated on stage. While wearing the smart glasses, Zuckerberg spoke in English to Mexican mixed martial artist Brandon Moreno replying in Spanish \u2014 the conversation was translated in real time. People can also dub their videos in another language so that it looks like they are speaking natively \u2014 even going so far as changing their lips movements to match.\nMeta AI now has 500 million users, the company said. Jeremy Goldman of the research firm Emarketer called the number \u201cjaw-dropping.\u201d\n\u201cMeta has transformed from just a social media company into an AI powerhouse. Zuckerberg\u2019s move to celebrity voices is not just for fun \u2014 it\u2019s a direct challenge to OpenAI, with an emphasis on real-world utility,\" Goldman said.\nMeta, which introduced the Quest 3 last year, also showed off a cheaper version of the VR goggles \u2014 the 3S \u2014 that will cost $299. The regular Quest 3 costs $499. The S3 will start shipping on Oct. 15.\n\u201cMeta is aggressively undercutting Apple\u2019s Vision Pro to dominate the middle-tier AR/VR market,\u201d Goldman said. Those VR goggles, which came out earlier this year after much anticipation, cost $3,500.\nWhile VR goggles have grabbed more headlines, the augmented reality Ray Bans turned out to be a sleeper hit for Meta. The company hasn't disclosed sales numbers, but Zuckerberg said during Meta's July earnings call that the glasses \u201ccontinue to be a bigger hit sooner than we expected \u2014 thanks in part to AI.\u201d Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that Meta seems to have gotten past the supply issues that plagued the Ray Bans a few months ago due to high demand.\n\u201cThey are kind of the perfect form factor for AI,\u201d Zuckerberg said. The glasses, he added, let an AI assistant \u201csee what you see, hear what you hear\u201d and help you go about your day.\nFor instance, you can ask the glasses to remind you where you parked or to pick up groceries, look at a pile of fruit and come up with a smoothie recipe, or help you pick out a party outfit.\nMeta \u2014 which renamed itself from Facebook in 2021, still makes nearly all of its money from advertising. In its most recent quarter, 98% of its more than $39 billion in revenue came from ads. At the same time, the company is investing heavily in AI and what Zuckerberg sees as the next generation of computing platforms such as VR headsets and AR glasses.\n\u201cVR headsets, despite Meta\u2019s assertion, will not go mainstream,\" said Forrester research director Mike Proulx. \u201cThey\u2019re too cumbersome, and people can only tolerate them in short bursts.\u201d\nGlasses, on the other hand \u201cput computing power directly into a common and familiar form factor. As the smart tech behind these glasses matures, they have the potential to disrupt everyday consumers\u2019 interactions with brands.\u201d\nProulx said the Orion prototype \"sets the stage for a future where a revolutionary 3D computing platform is within reach and can actually be useful to the everyday consumer.\u201d\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. debuted its first pair of augmented reality glasses \u2014 devices that show a combined view of the digital and physical worlds, a key step in Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s goal of one day offering a hands-free alternative to the smartphone.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai\u2019s Sky-High Rents\nGang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon\u2019s Fast-Growing Cities\nA Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda\u2019s Capital City\nNew Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century\nClimate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World\u2019s Megacities\nThe new glasses, introduced Wednesday and called Orion, look like thick, black reading glasses, but have lenses that can display text messages, video calls, and even YouTube videos onto the user\u2019s field of vision. They are prototypes that aren\u2019t for sale, but will be used internally at Meta for testing and improving the product.\nAn accompanying wristband that detects nerve stimulation and cameras built into the frames that track eye movement allow Orion wearers to \u201cclick\u201d or \u201cscroll\u201d on the display using just their hands.\nMeta\u2019s Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth said he expects the glasses will become a consumer product within the next decade, adding that the next two models are in the works.\nThe company wants to price the glasses so \u201cnot just consumers use it, but developers want to build for it,\u201d Bosworth said Wednesday in an interview on Bloomberg Television.\nThe glasses represent nearly a decade of technological advancement and significant financial investment at Meta. They also offer a glimpse into Zuckerberg\u2019s vision for the future of technology, which has cost the company tens of billions of dollars over the past four years alone.\nMeta is already selling Ray-Ban branded smart glasses equipped with cameras and speakers, but Zuckerberg believes that AR glasses will become a kind of mobile, hands-free computer that could one day rival smartphones as the preferred way to communicate and interact online. If smart glasses eventually become mainstream, Meta hopes to be a major player in that new industry, which would also help the company reduce its reliance on competitors like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google to deliver its products to consumers.\n\u201cThese things happen slowly and then kind of all at once,\u201d Bosworth said in the Bloomberg TV interview. \u201cWhen you can replace an existing use case, people can switch very quickly. Things like using augmented reality glasses to replace your phone, that\u2019s going to take a lot longer.\u201d\nThat goal is still years away despite the Orion prototype, which debuted at Meta\u2019s annual Connect conference in Menlo Park, California. The company had hoped to make this version of the device available to the public, but executives said it\u2019s not yet small enough or stylish enough. Those same challenges have plagued similar efforts by other tech companies over the years, including Google and Microsoft Corp.\nSnap Inc. unveiled its own pair of AR glasses earlier this month, but is only releasing them to developers.\nEventually, Meta executives believe they will be able to make the glasses thin and powerful enough that general consumers will buy them. The goal is to bring Orion to market in the \u201cnext few years\u201d for the price of a \u201chigh end laptop or smartphone,\u201d said Rahul Prasad, a senior director of product management at Meta.\n\u201cAny kind of prior attempt at AR has been a headset, goggles, helmets,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to get to glasses.\u201d\nFor now, Meta will continue to build and refine the glasses internally until they are ready for public sale. Hundreds of Meta employees have been testing the Orion glasses. The company plans to expand that group considerably now that they\u2019ve been debuted publicly.\nUnlike competing products, such as Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, Meta\u2019s Orion glasses don\u2019t require a bulky head strap or battery pack to operate. Orion has seven cameras, including two for tracking eye movements, which allow users to control the display using visible hand gestures. Orion works best, though, when paired with an accompanying wristband, which uses electromyography to detect much more subtle hand movements so users can control the glasses with minor finger movements.\nMeta designed and produced more than 10 different computer chips embedded in Orion, part of a plan to reduce energy consumption for the glasses but also to decrease the amount of heat generated so that they aren\u2019t warm to the touch. Instead of glass, Orion\u2019s lenses are made of silicon carbide, a material popular in some electric vehicles, which is lighter than glass and also helps bend light at extreme angles, Prasad said.\nWhile using silicon carbide is a major breakthrough for Meta, Bosworth said the company is already looking for a cheaper alternative that could provide the same functionality at a lower price.\nNew Quest VR Headset\nMeta also announced a new, cheaper version of its Quest virtual reality headset, freshening its effort to persuade consumers to spend more time using virtual and augmented reality to play games, watch videos and chat with others.\nThe Quest 3S headset has much of the same functionality as the existing Quest 3 device but offers less memory and is several hundred dollars cheaper. The headset will be available in stores beginning Oct. 15 and will cost as little as $300, compared to the $500 Quest 3 devices.\n--With assistance from Alicia Clanton and Ed Ludlow.\n(Updates with comments from Meta CTO beginning in the third paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Great \u20ac3 Billion Shipping Container Heist\nInvestors Hot on India Shrug Off Adani Short Seller Attack\nMilitary Veterans Help Plug Worker Shortages at EV, Battery Plants Sprouting Up in the US\nSports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought\nThe Presidential Election Isn\u2019t Stopping International Students From Coming to America\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Facebook-parent Meta Platforms hosted its annual Connect developer conference yesterday, where CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiled the tech giant\u2019s plans for the metaverse in the artificial intelligence era.\nThe Facebook founder began his keynote speech by introducing a low-cost version of the company\u2019s Quest 3 virtual reality headset, which is set to kickstart sales in mid-October. But he seemed more upbeat than in previous discussions, indicating a positive outlook for his vision ahead.\n\u201cWe can start to see how the future of computing and the future of human connection are going to look,\u201d Zuckerberg boasted to a large audience. He emphasized the capabilities of Quest, including a remote desktop integration with Windows 11.\nMeta plans to be a leader in the AI space. Zuckerberg stated that Meta AI is on pace to be the world\u2019s most used AI assistant by the end of 2024. Between Facebook and Instagram, the chatbot garners more than 500 million monthly active users.\nTo top it all off, Meta previewed their Orion Augmented Reality glasses; Zuckerberg described the prototype as \u201cthe most advanced glasses the world has ever seen.\u201d Aimed at bridging the gap between the physical and virtual worlds, the glasses will feature holographic displays that adapt to user surroundings.\nShares of Meta Platforms META, which are currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have surged nearly 60% this year. The world\u2019s largest social media platform, Meta has surpassed earnings estimates in each of the past seven quarters.\nImage Source: StockCharts\nBack in July, Meta reported second-quarter earnings of $5.16/share, representing a 9.8% surprise over the $4.70/share estimate. The company has delivered a trailing four-quarter average earnings surprise of 12.6%.\nAnalysts covering META stock are in agreement and have been raising earnings estimates across the board. Looking at 2024 as a whole, EPS estimates have been increased by 3.74% in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now stands at $21.36/share, translating to a whopping 43.6% growth rate relative to last year. Meta continues to innovate and find ways to accelerate growth, a remarkable feat for a company of its size.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhile there are many ways to take advantage of this bullish move, options provide us with flexibility, enabling us to tailor our strategy to the current market environment.\nWhen done correctly, trading options provides huge profit opportunities with limited risk making options one of the most versatile investment vehicles.\nBefore we analyze today\u2019s trade, let\u2019s review some option fundamentals as a refresher. There is no need to worry about complex mathematical formulas or equations. Over the years I\u2019ve found that the more complicated a strategy is, the less likely it is to work over the long run.\nOptions are standardized contracts that give the buyer the right \u2013 but not the obligation \u2013 to buy or sell the underlying stock at a fixed price, which is known as the strike price. A call option gives the buyer the right to buy a particular security, while a put option gives the buyer the right to sell the same. The investor who purchases an option, whether a put or call, is the option buyer, while the investor who sells a put or call is the seller or writer.\nThese contracts are valid for a specific period of time which ends on expiration day. There are weekly options, monthly options, and even LEAPS options which are longer-term options that have an expiration date of greater than one year.\nOption spreads can be an extremely effective strategy. Debit spreads are implemented by purchasing a call option and selling a related call option with a higher strike price. These types of trades are limited risk trades because the short option is \u2018covered\u2019 by the option purchase.\nBelow we\u2019re going to explore a call option spread strategy.\nMeta currently meets our criteria for initiating a bullish call option spread position. META stock is trending well and outperforming the market this year. The company is witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions, which our research has shown to be the most powerful force impacting stock prices.\nThe table below displays the risk/reward profile for this trade. META is trading at $564.63/share at the time of this writing. This trade involves purchasing the November 500-strike call at 77.8 points, and selling the November 520-strike call at 62.8 points for a total cost of 15 points. As option contracts represent 100 shares of the underlying security, this would represent a total cost of $1,500 per spread (orange box).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe top (blue) row in the lower section shows the performance of META stock based on different percentage scenarios at expiration. The last (purple) row shows the corresponding percentage return for our debit spread trade. We can see that regardless of whether META increases in price, remains flat, or even loses 5% from our entry, our option spread trade will produce a 33.3% return.\nThese are types of odds I like to have in my favor when trading options.\n1) The Option Sale Provides Downside Protection\nThe sale of a call option results in cash being credited to your brokerage account. This reduces the cost basis of the option purchase and provides downside protection in the event the price of the underlying stock declines.\n2) Risk is Reduced\nIn the META trade just presented, the sale of the 520-strike call reduced the risk of the 500-strike purchase from $7,780 to just $1,500 per contract.\n3) Allows Us to Maintain Positions During Volatile Markets\nThe downside protection provided by the call option sale helps us maintain our spread trade during heightened volatility. Naked option purchases may force us to sell early in order to prevent large losses.\n4) Spreads Can Be Profitable If Stock Goes Up or Down\nOption spreads can be profitable even if the underlying stock decreases or remains flat, providing us with an entirely new dimension of money-making opportunities.\nRemember that the call option sold through this strategy profits as the price of the underlying stock declines, providing us with a cushion during market pullbacks.\nOption spreads are a safe way to use the leverage inherent in options. Your risk is limited to the price paid for the spread. The call option spread strategy is an excellent way to take advantage of the bullish move in META shares.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Meta added that it is \u201cfocusing on our compliance work under the AI Act at this time\u201d and wants to prioritize that effort.\nMeta\u2019s position contrasts with Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, which both confirmed through spokespeople that they will sign the pledge. The company stands out from its Big Tech peers because its AI model, Llama, has open source features that are designed to be repurposed by users with relatively little control from the developer. That could make it more difficult to comply with requirements to map risks with the tools.\nFrance\u2019s open-source AI startup Mistral, which in June reached a \u20ac5.8 billion ($6.5 billion) valuation, will not sign the pledge either, according to a spokesperson.\nThe EU is seeking to set standards for regulating the fast-developing field of AI, while not stifling innovation in the emerging technology and risk ceding the industry to US firms. The nonbinding pledge asks developers to comply with the key obligations of the AI Act before they become law.\nCompanies that sign it will commit to follow a list of practices that mirror the AI Act\u2019s principles, including charting whether their AI tools are likely to be deployed in \u201chigh-risk\u201d situations, such as education, employment or policing. The EU\u2019s executive branch, the European Commission, will unveil the full list of signatories on Wednesday.\nSince the AI Pact isn\u2019t legally binding, companies won\u2019t face any consequences for not signing. Those that do could avoid potential clashes with the EU, which has been known to name and shame technology companies that spurn its voluntary initiatives.\nElon Musk\u2019s Twitter Inc. \u2013 later renamed X \u2013 left the EU\u2019s nonbinding anti-disinformation code of practice in 2023. Thierry Breton, who was the bloc\u2019s tech chief at the time, quipped \u201cyou can run but you can\u2019t hide\u201d in a tweet.\nCompanies that join the pact will \u201cbuild trust among customers, investors, and regulators,\u201d said Ceyhun Pehlivan, co-lead of tech and intellectual property in the Linklaters\u2019 law practice in Madrid. Holdouts might \u201cface peer pressure and risk being singled out for not joining,\u201d he added.\nMeta in July announced it would delay the introduction of its next generation of models in the EU \u201cdue to the unpredictable nature of the European regulatory environment.\u201d\n(Updates with Meta comment in second paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nApple Rolls Back Its Big Plans to Release Movies in Theaters\nSports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought\nThe End of the Cheap Burger\nInside Activision and Blizzard\u2019s Corporate Warcraft\nThis Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "Text": "At its current level, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) looks too cheap. Even though its market cap is now worth $1.31 trillion, its powerful free cash flow could push the stock higher.\nThis analysis will show how why and set a price target based on Meta Platforms' free cash flow margin and analysts' revenue estimates. This method uses a FCF yield metric to value the stock. However, the company is attracting value investors due to its strong free cash flow generation.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nThe social media giant's basic growth is intact, which is powering its revenue and FCF growth. In the quarter ending June 30, revenue was up 22% year over year and climbed 7.90% quarter over quarter (i.e., $39.10 billion versus $36.50 billion in the first quarter).\nThis is based on strong viewer participation in Facebook and other sites. As of June 30, it had 3.27 billion daily active people in its family of apps (including Instagram and WhatsApp). That was a little less than 1% higher than the prior quarter's 3.24 billion DAP stat. More importantly, this was 6.50% higher than a year earlier (3.07 billion DAP) and 13.50% over two years ago (2.88 billion DAP).\nSource: Meta's second-quarter 2024 earnings slides\nAs a result, analysts now expect revenue will rise 17.50% this year to $158.50 billion and 12.50% to $178 billion in 2025. That works out to a three-year compound annual growth rate of 10% this year and over 15% by the end of 2025.\nLast year, Meta Platforms generated $43 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Over the next two years, despite a dip in 2024, adjusted FCF will grow significantly. FCF is cash flow after all its operating cash expenses, including working capital changes and capital expenditure spending. It also deducts principal payments on leases as a FCF adjustment.\nThe table above shows Meta is forecasted to make $40.30 billion in adjusted FCF this year. That is is slightly lower than last year (6.20% below $43 billion in 2023). But next year, the company is likely to have substantially stronger FCF (up 17.50% at $47.40 billion).\nMoreover, Meta's margins will stay strong despite a dip in 2024. For example, adjusted FCF margins should stay over 25% in both 2024 and 2025, although this is lower than the 31.90% achieved in 2023. That can be seen in the chart below.\nThese strong FCF margins are despite much higher spending by Meta on capex due to the buildout of its artificial intelligence capabilities. Management told analysts in the earnings call that its capex spending will be in the range of $37-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $35-40 billion.\nMoreover, in 2025, the company said it \"currently expect[s] significant capex growth in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and our product development efforts.\nHere is how this was modeled in a spreadsheet on Meta. Starting with a $161.50 billion estimate for 2024 revenue, I applied an operating cash flow margin of 49.50%.\nThe table below shows this was the average of the past two quarters. This results in a forecast of $79.80 billion for 2024 (close to last year's $71.10 billion operating cash flow) and $90.50 billion for 2025.\nThe net result is that by 2025, Meta may be generating $47.40 billion in adjusted FCF, up 17.50% over 2024 ($40.30 billion) and 10.50% over 2023 ($43 billion).\nWe can use this FCF estimate to set a price target. I like to use a FCF yield metric to do this. This assumes the company pays out 100% of its free cash flow as a dividend. So the value is set by using the company's historical FCF yield.\nFor example, in the last 12 months ending June 30, Meta has generated $48.60 billion in adjusted FCF (which includes $23.40 billion in the first half of 2024 and $25.10 billion in the second quarter of 2023).\nThis last 12-month adjusted FCF of $48.60 billion represents 3.69% of Meta's existing market value. Moreover, the forecasted 2024 adjusted FCF ($40.30 billion) is equal to 3.06% of its market cap.\nThat implies that we can use a 3.33% FCF yield metric (i.e., 30 times FCF) to value Meta. Over time, as the market's outlook on the company improves, that could rise to a 3% FCF yield (33.30 multiple). Using a 3.33% FCF yield (30 times FCF) shows Meta is fairly valued today.\nHowever, using a slightly better metric of 3% FCF yield (i.e., 33.30 multiple), which is equivalent to Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) valuation, the upside is better:\nI think the latter forecast (with up to a 20% upside) is more likely to occur. This is because I expect the market will raise its valuation on the stock as free cash flow stays strong despite higher capex spending.\nIn other words, the market will incorporate the company's spending on AI initiatives into forecasts, and likely apply some benefits with higher margins and earnings.\nHowever, in the medium term, the stock could tread water as Meta's higher capex spending continues to lower forecasts for its FCF this year.\nAnalysts tend to agree with me. For example, AnaChart.com, a new sell-side analyst tracking service, shows the average price target of 46 analysts today is $587.02 per share. That is 11% above today's price and close to my target price of $577.82.\nHowever, the highest target price projection by AnaChart's survey is $645 per share. This is close to my upside price target of $624.30 based on its free cash flow margin and FCF yield.\nHere is the bottom line. Meta looks undervalued given its strong revenue and DAP forecasts. This is despite higher capex spending, which will lower its free cash flow in the near term.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

Now, their attention is on an event this week for insights into where the stock\u2019s record-breaking rally is heading next.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nEric Adams' Vanishing Promise to Fix NYC's 'Unfair' Property Taxes\nUnlocking the Hidden Power of Zoning, for Good or Bad\nWaiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development\nNY\u2019s MTA Warns Against Borrowing More Than $13 Billion\nBelfast\u2019s Grand Central Station Creates New Era for Northern Ireland\u2019s Public Transport\nMeta\u2019s annual Connect conference kicks off Wednesday, with industry buzz around the reveal of a prototype augmented reality eyewear product, plus the usual star turn by Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg. Attendees will want to hear the CEO\u2019s latest updates on artificial intelligence applications and investment.\nShares of the social media company have gained about 13% from a trough in early September, hitting an all-time high close last week. Only Nvidia Corp. has fared better among the Magnificent Seven cohort than Meta\u2019s almost 60% advance in 2024.\n\u201cPart of the reason why the stock has done as well as it has, is they\u2019re one of the few that is tangibly benefiting from AI usage,\u201d said Michael Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management.\nThe two-day conference should be a valuable opportunity to learn about Meta\u2019s AI intentions, Sansoterra said, describing the Menlo Park, California-based company\u2019s event as \u201ca data point that, you know, gives you some color.\u201d\nShares of Meta slipped as much as 0.9% in early trading Tuesday.\nWhat Meta showcases could be the next potential catalyst on deck for megacap technology stocks as investors assess the longevity of the AI trade. Some still doubt the payoff from heavy spending by companies on this industry craze and, while Meta has been able to show that big outlays on AI are yielding results, capital expenditure remains under scrutiny.\nIn recent years, the Connect event hasn\u2019t immediately triggered large stock swings in itself, but has foreshadowed Meta earnings releases heading into the fourth quarter. Two years ago, the gathering showcased a new headset and updates on the Metaverse, just ahead of a damaging earnings release where investors balked at Meta\u2019s high spending on the technology.\nLast year, Meta announced multiple AI initiatives, including its Meta AI assistant and a slew of AI chatbots on social media. About a month later, investors again showed their displeasure at Meta\u2019s quarterly results, as it warned about economic headwinds for advertising purchases while continuing to invest heavily in AI and virtual reality.\nThe mood is a little different this time round. Meta seems to have convinced investors \u2014 at least for now \u2014 that it will keep seeing payoff for pouring money into new technology. During the last earnings call, Zuckerberg successfully made the case that spending on AI is helping to improve Meta\u2019s core business, spurring gains in its stock that outpaced its megacap peers.\n\u201cThe Connect conference has been more of a pivotal event for Meta, not because of the products itself, but more so from what Zuckerberg has been saying from a holistic fundamental perspective,\u201d said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC.\nWall Street has long been bullish on Meta shares, but the Facebook owner has lately attracted increased analyst attention. Cantor Fitzgerald and DA Davidson both initiated coverage of Meta this month with buy-equivalent ratings.\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan also named the company a top pick with \u201cfurther potential for upward estimate revisions and an attractive valuation,\u201d in a Sept. 4 note.\nMeta\u2019s valuation partly explains why investors are still buying at record highs. The company trades at about 24 times forward earnings, roughly in line with its 10-year average and a discount to the 26-times ratio for the Nasdaq 100. It\u2019s also cheaper than the approximately 29 times commanded by the Magnificent Seven Index.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what I would consider an expensive stock,\u201d Sansoterra said. \u201cBut it is a stock that is clearly growing better than investors thought, even a few quarters ago.\u201d\nAfter attracting some new bulls, Meta\u2019s average price target is at a record high of about $574, implying about 3% further upside.\nTech Chart of the Day\nAs China ramps up more support to boost its ailing economy, the local internet stock sector might also see some more support. The divergence in performance between an ETF tracking Chinese internet shares and the Nasdaq QQQ ETF is among the widest thematic gaps in markets, with almost 40 percentage points of China underperformance. Concerns around online shoppers and the local economy have been too strong to allow any AI optimism to sneak into the sector for now.\nTop Tech Stories\nCable billionaire John Malone\u2019s Liberty Broadband Corp. is proposing an all-stock merger with Charter Communications Inc., one of the top pay-TV providers in the US and another of the media investor\u2019s key holdings.\nApollo Global Management Inc. has offered to make a multibillion-dollar investment in Intel Corp., people familiar with the matter said, providing the chipmaker with a vote of confidence in its turnaround strategy and an alternative to a potential takeover by larger rival Qualcomm Inc.\nThe US House approved legislation that would exempt some semiconductor manufacturing projects from federal permitting requirements, addressing concerns that environmental reviews and lawsuits will delay construction of domestic chip factories.\nMicrosoft Corp., aiming to shore up cybersecurity after a series of damning failures, has hired new executives from places like the US government and is holding weekly meetings with its most senior executives to advance a companywide initiative to make its software more resilient.\nEarnings Due Tuesday\nPostmarket\nProgress Software\n--With assistance from Jan-Patrick Barnert and Subrat Patnaik.\n(Updates stock move at market open.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nPalantir\u2019s CEO and Wall Street Annoy Each Other Straight to the Bank\nFive Reasons to Be Optimistic About the Entertainment Business\nThreats to Local US Election Officials Are Rising, and More Workers Are Quitting\nThe Man Who Made Nike Uncool\nIn Yosemite, Problems With Concessions Keep Piling Up\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "(Reuters) - Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg is known for his passion, including for ancient Rome, and on Wednesday he wore a shirt that played on his own ambitions as his company launched what he described as the best glasses in the world.\nAt Meta's annual Connect event in Menlo Park, California, Zuckerberg wore a custom T-shirt with the Latin phrase \"aut Zuck aut nihil,\" or \"all Zuck or all nothing,\" as he revealed the first working prototype of Meta's augmented-reality glasses.\nThe phrase was a play on \"aut Caesar aut nihil,\" which means \"either a Caesar or nothing,\" or more simply \"all or nothing.\"\nThe saying, indicative of grand ambition, was a personal motto of Italian Renaissance Prince Cesare Borgia and was possibly coined by Julius Caesar himself, according to some scholars.\nZuckerberg has long been interested in the Roman Empire. He spent his honeymoon in Rome and two of his children, August and Aurelia, are named after emperors Augustus and Marcus Aurelius.\nEarlier this year on his 40th birthday, Zuckerberg posted photos on social media in which he wore a T-shirt with the words \"Carthago delenda est,\" meaning \"Carthage must be destroyed,\" referring to Rome's great rival.\nZuckerberg's latest fashion statement comes as Meta Platforms seeks to overcome past tech industry failures and develop augmented-reality devices that are embraced by the masses.\nWhile Meta's new Orion AR glasses are not yet available for users and for now are mostly for internal testing, they represent Zuckerberg's vision for products that would bring the virtual world into the real one.\n\"The way to think about AR glasses is as a time machine,\" Zuckerberg said on Wednesday. \"They exist, they are awesome and they are a glimpse of a future that I think is going to be pretty exciting.\"\n(Reporting by Aditya Soni in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Henderson and Matthew Lewis)\n"

        "Author": "  Sasha Rogelberg ",
        "Text": "If Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s new laid-back look\u2014complete with shaggy hair and chunky gold chain\u2014is any indication, he\u2019s much different from the straightlaced, crew-cutted Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that the business philosophies of Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta (META) and Apple are as different as their two leaders. Zuckerberg has been eager to point out those differences and prod at a decades-long feud between the two tech giants and their chief executives.\nWhile Meta has prioritized acting fast and engaging users, such as through its open-sourcing of its Llama AI model, Zuckerberg said in the Acquired podcast episode released Tuesday, Apple prefers maintaining a closed ecosystem of polished, exclusive products.\n\"I think in a lot of ways we're like the opposite of Apple,\" he said. \"Clearly, their stuff has worked really well too. They take this approach that's like, 'We're going to take a long time, we're going to polish it, we're going to put it out,' and maybe for the stuff that they're doing that works, maybe that just fits with their culture.\"\nSince Tim Cook took the helm of the tech behemoth, Apple has prided itself on being the best, rather than the first. For the most part, it\u2019s worked out for the company, demonstrated by its superlative of the world's largest smartphone provider. Apple has long tended to its walled garden of in-house products, which has resulted in a uniform line of apps and accessories bespoke to its tech\u2014and a whopping antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice.\nBut Zuckerberg touted Meta\u2019s own spaghetti-at-the-wall approach to its products, which he believes has elicited helpful critiques and enabled the company to grow in spite of its failures.\n\"You want to really have a culture that values shipping and getting things out and getting feedback more than needing always to get great positive accolades from people when you put stuff out,\" he said.\nThere\u2019s certainly been no shortage of feedback toward Meta, exemplified by social media platform Thread\u2019s meteoric rise to 100 million users, only for the number of accounts to atrophy weeks later. Its flagship Metaverse was a $46.5 billion failure, but that still hasn\u2019t stopped Zuckerberg from adding $58 billion to his net worth this year.\nApple\u2019s perfectionism has been at its own expense, Zuckerberg said, arguing the company prioritizes praise above constructive feedback from users.\n\"If you want to wait until you get praised all the time,\u201d he said, \u201cyou're missing a bunch of the time when you could've learned a bunch of useful stuff and then incorporated that into the next version you're going to ship.\u201d\nApple and Meta did not immediately respond to Fortune\u2019s requests for comment.\nZuckerberg\u2019s commentary on Apple\u2019s ways of doing business is not the first time he\u2019s shared his thoughts on Cook\u2019s company. For over a decade, he and Cook have differed on their philosophies not only on how to roll out products, but on the future of the internet more broadly.\nEarlier this month Meta and Apple\u2019s feud reached a fever pitch after Meta urged greater government regulation of social media platforms, suggesting Apple and Google set age restrictions and requirements for parental consent. But Apple disagreed, arguing the onus for restrictions should be placed on the platform themselves.\nTensions between the two companies have been tightening since 2014, when Cook suggested Facebook made its money through the collection of personal data. The following year, Apple unveiled its motto, \u201cPrivacy is a fundamental human right.\u201d Cook also lambasted Facebook as a hotbed for Russian misinformation used to mislead American voters ahead of the 2016 election.\nZuckerberg seems keen on fanning the flames of the tech rivalry today, calling Apple Meta\u2019s \u201cprimary competitor\u201d on Tuesday\u2019s podcast. Cook historically has not agreed.\n\"Oh, I think that we compete in some things,\" Cook said in 2021. \"But no, if I may ask who our biggest competitors are, they would not be listed. We're not in the social networking business.\"\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Title": "Australian lawmakers force Meta to admit only regulation will force it to offer AI training opt-out",
        "Author": "  Sage Lazzaro ",
        "Text": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI. In today\u2019s edition\u2026Meta admits only regulation will stop it from scraping user data to train its AI products; AI models get more multimodal (and more emotional); big tech splurges big on AI equipment.\u00a0\nDuring a government inquiry earlier this week in Australia, Meta's global privacy director Melinda Claybaugh admitted that the company scraped the public photos and posts of every Australian adult user to train its AI models without providing an option to opt out\u2014because it can. More specifically, because regulators haven\u2019t stopped it from doing so.\nAccording to the Australian Broadcasting Company, Claybaugh initially denied the scraping of user data for AI models, explicitly stating \u201cwe have not done that\u201d when a senator asked whether Meta used posts from Australian users going back as far back as 2007 to train its AI products. After being pressed, she said that yes, in fact, the company has done that.\n\"The truth of the matter is that unless you have consciously set those posts to private since 2007, Meta has just decided that you will scrape all of the photos and all of the texts from every public post on Instagram or Facebook since 2007, unless there was a conscious decision to set them on private. That's the reality, isn't it?\u201d another senator asked.\n\"Correct,\u201d replied Claybaugh.\nClaybaugh went on to make clear that the company has not scraped data from users under 18, but she could not answer about the fate of posts from users who are now adults but opened their accounts when they were under 18. She also said that public photos of children posted by adults would have been scrapped. Additionally, she said that a user setting their account to private to prevent future scraping would not allow them to regain privacy over what\u2019s already been used.\nOne could argue that these posts are public and open for the taking, but there\u2019s a world of difference between allowing a profile to be public so users can interact with you and giving a trillion-dollar company unfettered permission to take your content and use it to build commercial AI products as it wishes. Yes, Meta may have legally gotten permission by putting its right to do so in its terms and conditions, but that is not anything near explicit or real consent. Overall, it\u2019s a bleak picture of user privacy.\nMeta having questionable data practices is not exactly new\u2014and it\u2019s already been known that the company is training its models on user data. What struck me as interesting about this, however, was the part of the conversation that unfolded about why Australians were not offered an option to opt out.\nAfter being questioned about why Australian users don\u2019t have the option to opt out as users in the EU do, Claybaugh cited the Union\u2019s strict data laws.\n\"In Europe there is an ongoing legal question around what is the interpretation of existing privacy law with respect to AI training. We have paused launching our AI products in Europe while there is a lack of certainty. So you are correct that we are offering an opt-out to users in Europe. I will say that the ongoing conversation in Europe is the direct result of the existing regulatory landscape,\u201d she said, referring to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). That law has created obstacles for Meta\u2019s plans to train on EU user data and also caused the company in June to announce it was pausing plans to roll out its AI models to EU users.\nBasically, Claybaugh admitted that Meta will only take a privacy-first approach if regulators force its hand. In response to a request for comment about not offering an opt-out option in all jurisdictions, a Meta spokesperson further made clear that users are at the whim of their local regulators. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t currently have an opt-out feature, we\u2019ve built in-platform tools that allow people to delete their personal information from chats with Meta AI across our apps. Depending on where people live, they can also object to the use of their personal information being used to build and train AI consistent with local privacy laws,\u201d the spokesperson told Eye on AI.\nMany would argue that the entire discussion is misguided and that the process should be entirely opt-in. And, overall, the saga highlights the importance of both data privacy and AI regulations.\nCritics of regulating AI often argue that doing so would inadvertently hurt smaller AI startups, handing dominance to the big tech players. But those big tech players already dominate\u2013and they use their access to massive amounts of user data to continue to advance their position. Regulation around data privacy might actually give smaller companies a fighting chance, especially if they found a less ethically challenged way to collect data.\nWhat\u2019s more, Meta\u2019s comments underline the urgent role regulators have in protecting consumers amid AI\u2019s rapid proliferation.\nAnd with that, here\u2019s more AI news.\nSage Lazzarosage.lazzaro@consultant.fortune.comsagelazzaro.com\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Li-Chen Miller wasn\u2019t even a Meta Platforms Inc. employee when she started working to fix the company\u2019s video-recording sunglasses.Miller was working at Microsoft Corp. in late 2021 when she purchased a pair of Ray-Ban Stories, the first version of Meta\u2019s souped-up sunglasses. But her excitement about the novel idea was quickly overshadowed by all the ways she thought they could be improved. So she dashed off a detailed \u2014 and unsolicited \u2014 list of suggested fixes to Alex Himel, Meta\u2019s head of wearables.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nVanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion\nNJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC\nWhere Cargo Bikes Are Freeing Cities From Polluting Vans\nExclusive Palo Alto Girls School Borrows $106 Million\nWaiting for the Miracle of Church-to-Housing Development\n\u201cShe wrote me an email that articulated what she thought was good about the device and what was promising, and then a longer list of things that she would improve,\u201d Himel said, recalling that he agreed with most of the ideas.\nMiller\u2019s email and her meticulous attention to detail landed her a job the following year at Meta, where she now oversees products for the entire wearables division, including a full line of the Ray-Ban glasses she previously critiqued. Once more of a novelty, the glasses are becoming increasingly important within Meta, owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has spent billions of dollars researching and building futuristic wearable technology, a bet on his belief that augmented reality glasses, which can overlay images and text on a user\u2019s view of the physical world, will be the next major computing platform. One day, the company has suggested, they may even replace the phone in your pocket.\nThat vision will be on display Sept. 25 at Meta\u2019s annual Connect conference in Menlo Park, California, where the company is expected to unveil an AR glasses prototype that also falls under Miller\u2019s authority, codenamed Orion. While an AR version is still years away from mainstream availability, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses are available now, and have been a \u201cbigger hit sooner than we expected,\u201d Zuckerberg told investors last month.While the current edition of Meta-powered Ray-Bans don\u2019t yet have augmented reality capabilities, they do have video cameras, speakers and an AI assistant you can talk to. They\u2019re also significantly more stylish than the Orion glasses are expected to be, and cost $299. That\u2019s been enough to attract more than half a million consumers, according to market research firm IDC, which estimates Meta has shipped upwards of 700,000 pairs of the latest Ray-Bans since their launch in 2023.Meta\u2019s goal is to one day merge these two projects into one product: A fashionable pair of glasses coupled with advanced AR technology. The idea is to get people accustomed to the idea of smart glasses slowly, building up to a pair with full augmented reality capabilities. There\u2019s a \u201claddering up to AR glasses that we\u2019re certainly going after,\u201d said Heidi Young, Meta\u2019s vice president of engineering.\nFor now, the top of that ladder is many rungs away. After years of investment, Meta is still far from delivering a pair of glasses that are stylish enough to work for general consumers but powerful enough to offer AR features. Other companies have tried augmented reality glasses, including Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Snapchat parent Snap Inc., though neither has found a robust market for their products in part because the glasses look bulky or weird. Eight years after first taking a crack at the wearables market, Snap showed off its own AR glasses, called Spectacles, earlier this month, but is only releasing them to developers.\nFor Zuckerberg, successfully blending the Ray-Ban styles with AR features would be the ultimate aim, since owning a widely used pair of AR glasses would mark a step toward decreasing Meta\u2019s reliance on rivals like Apple Inc. and Google. The two companies dominate the smartphone market, which also means they serve as middlemen between Meta\u2019s products and the consumers who use them. Zuckerberg has said that structure has hurt Meta\u2019s business and can be \u201csoul crushing.\u201d If glasses are indeed the future, Zuckerberg wants to own the market.\nMiller will have a major role in determining whether Zuckerberg\u2019s vision succeeds. A self-described \u201ccrazy cat lady,\u201d she took the stage at Meta\u2019s Connect conference a year ago in a pair of Hello Kitty jeans and a T-shirt featuring a picture of her own cat, Adobo. She delivered an impassioned speech to thousands of software developers about the potential for Meta\u2019s smart glasses. \u201cYou no longer have to choose between capturing the moment or truly experiencing it,\u201d she said. Even though the attendees had mostly flocked to Meta\u2019s headquarters to hear more about the company\u2019s latest Quest virtual reality headsets, Miller stole the show.\n\u201cThey were not there for glasses, and then she took the stage and I think really overpowered the event,\u201d Himel said. \u201cA large percentage of people who went to the event actually bought glasses on the spot and took them home.\u201d\nSales savvy aside, Miller\u2019s contributions to Meta\u2019s wearables division are the result of spending almost two decades at Microsoft, where she worked on a collection of consumer products that included Xbox, Windows, Windows Phone and the Bing search engine. It was there that Miller first developed a reputation among colleagues for being \u201cin the weeds\u201d \u2014 displaying a knack for the kind of detailed analysis that caught Himel\u2019s eye. \u201cShe would be in every single ship room and review we had for the program,\u201d said Marleine Daoud, who worked with Miller on new features for Xbox\u2019s rewards program. That level of involvement was rare for leaders at her level, Daoud said.\nMiller also learned the challenges of packing a lot of computing power into tiny devices, said Shiraz Cupala, a product leader for Microsoft Teams, who worked with Miller on bringing Xbox features to Windows Phone. \u201cYou have to take into account the constraints of the device to create an experience that really works well and is reliable,\u201d Cupala said. \u201cShe has a very strong instinct about how to make those hard decisions.\u201d\nThat skillset has been put to use as Miller worked on Meta\u2019s smart glasses, which feel as thin as regular sunglasses but are enhanced by Meta\u2019s virtual assistant, Meta AI, and can take photos, record videos, play music and respond to voice commands. She uses them all the time, sometimes for helpful things, like using the camera and voice assistant to translate a menu in a foreign language, or for mundane things like recording her cats playing around in the living room. Some days, Miller wears the glasses as much as 14 hours.\nWhile in Paris this summer to watch the Olympics, for example, Miller brought along three different pairs of Meta\u2019s smart glasses, some of which had unreleased features and technology, to stress test them in the \u201cwild,\u201d according to Himel. When she returned from vacation, she once again handed her boss a list of changes and feedback.\n\u201cWhen you wear a product that much, you do love it,\u201d Young said. \u201cBut you also see all of the little flaws and warts all over the product and so you just become doggedly obsessed with fixing those things.\u201d Young credits Miller with having an outsized influence on the product\u2019s look and feel, including the cat-eye shape, which Meta worked on alongside Ray-Ban parent company EssilorLuxottica. She also said Miller has pushed hard to improve the camera and its functionality within the glasses to ensure high-quality photos. \u201cIf there was one person that put their fingerprint on this product, I would say it\u2019s her,\u201d Young said.\nMiller says part of what motivated her to join Meta was the company\u2019s drive to dominate a new category of technology. \u201cI want to work on something that will still be here and be relevant in 10 years,\u201d she said in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek earlier this year. \u201cIt was very attractive to me that Meta is very ambitious. Mark puts money where his mouth is.\u201d\nMiller wasn\u2019t the only critic of Meta\u2019s first pair of smart glasses from 2021; only 10% of the people who bought them used them monthly, according to the Wall Street Journal. Snap fared even worse with its first effort at glasses several years ago, and the company ended up taking a $40 million writedown for unsold inventory.\nZuckerberg seems more optimistic this time. He said advancements in Meta\u2019s AI voice assistant are part of why the current Meta-enabled Ray-Bans are more useful, spurring adoption. \u201cDemand is still outpacing our ability to build them,\u201d he said in July.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nInside Activision and Blizzard\u2019s Corporate Warcraft\nThe End of the Cheap Burger\nThis Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "Text": "Tuesday, September 17, 2024The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (META), Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) and The Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW), as well as a micro-cap stock IDT Corp. (IDT). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Meta Platforms\u2019 shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+51.1% vs. +15.7%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone.It witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)Shares of Texas Instruments have gained +19.0% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s gain of +94.4%. The company is benefiting from solid data center demand which is boosting its prospects in the enterprise systems market. Improving conditions in the personal electronics and communication equipment markets are a plus.Texas Instruments\u2019 growing investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages are tailwinds. Its deepening focus on manufacturing, advanced technology infusion, product portfolio expansion and consistent returns to shareholders, is another positive.However, widespread weakness in the industrial, and automotive markets is major concern. Sluggishness in its Analog, Embedded Processing and Other segments is a negative. Increasing manufacturing costs are hurting its profitability. Overall weak demand environment and growing U.S.-China tensions are concerns.(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here >>>)Charles Schwab\u2019s have underperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the year-to-date period (-6.3% vs. +15.7%). As the company deals with low-yielding assets on its balance sheet, it plans to shrink itself to sustain profits and rely more on off-balance sheet arrangements to house deposits. This will likely put pressure on top-line expansion.The Zacks analyst project total revenues to increase just 1.7% in 2024. Also, elevated expenses are likely to hamper profitability. Though we estimate the total expense to decline in 2024, it will increase in 2025. Yet, higher rates will likely aid net interest margin (NIM) while rising funding costs and low-yielding assets will weigh on it. We project NIM to be 2.13% in 2024.Also, strategic acquisitions have increased the company\u2019s client assets. We estimate total client assets to see a CAGR of 6.9% by 2026. Also, sustainable capital distributions are encouraging.(You can read the full research report on Charles Schwab here >>>)Shares of IDT have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Communication Services industry over the year-to-date period (+12.0% vs. +8.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $ 965.16 million has high-growth, high-margin businesses which enhanced overall results, boosting consolidated gross margin by 310 basis points in third-quarter fiscal 2024.NRS, with over 30,000 active terminals and a 65.9% year-over-year increase in merchant services revenues, leads growth, indicating robust expansion and profitability. Positive adjusted EBITDA across segments underscores operational efficiency. IDT's consistent gross profit rise, cost management and technological advancements drive sustained growth.Yet, IDT faces risks from economic downturns, integration challenges, cybersecurity threats and international expansion. Declining traditional telecom revenues and rising operating expenses pose challenges. Compliance with fintech regulations adds to cost pressures, and competitive markets require continuous innovation to maintain market share.(You can read the full research report on IDT here >>>)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include AT&T Inc.

The event also featured a glimpse of Orion, a fully functioning prototype of AR smart glasses that blend AR and AI together on one device. The firm thinks Meta is making encouraging progress along its AI product roadmap with Meta AI on track to become the most used AI assistant globally by the end of this year. Meta\u2019s Reality Labs investments are an area of investor debate, with the unit generating -$16.7B of operating losses over the past twelve months. That said, Wedbush thinks Reality Labs investments are becoming more synergistic with the core business as AI becomes a more central component of existing and upcoming hardware products. New products within the Quest 3 family and upcoming AR hardware like Orion present significant optionality for Meta as the company looks to build next generation computing platforms at scale, the firm adds.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.\nAnother thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.\nWhat if you'd invested in Meta Platforms (META) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to META for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Meta Platforms' main business drivers.\nMeta Platforms is the world\u2019s largest social media platform. The company\u2019s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta\u2019s family of products used by almost 3.24 billion people on a daily basis as of Mar 31, 2024.Headquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Meta generated revenues worth $134.9 billion in 2023. Advertisement accounted for 97.8% of revenues. Marketers buy ads that can appear on multiple platforms including Meta, Instagram, Messenger and third-party applications and websites.Meta, thanks to its huge user base gained a significant market share in the advertising space wherein it faces tough competition from Google, Twitter, Amazon and Snapchat-parent Snap.Meta also faces significant competition from the likes of Apple (messaging), YouTube (advertising and video), Bytedance (social media) and Tencent (messaging and social media).Meta core app enables people to connect, share, discover and communicate with one other on mobile devices and personal computers. User engagement on core Meta platform is fostered by News Feed that displays an algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements customized for each user.Instagram is a community for sharing photos, videos and messages, enabling people to discover interests that they care about. People can express themselves through photos, videos and private messaging via Instagram Feed and Stories.Messenger helps people to connect with friends, family, groups and businesses across platforms and devices. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable and secure messaging application, used by people and businesses around the world to communicate in a private way.Meta also offers virtual reality (VR) products through its Oculus division.\nAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Meta Platforms a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.\nAccording to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in October 2014 would be worth $7,242.41, or a 624.24% gain, as of October 1, 2024. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\nThe S&P 500 rose 192.17% and the price of gold increased 109.16% over the same time frame in comparison.\nGoing forward, analysts are expecting more upside for META.\nMeta is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone. It witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 9.81%, and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "Author": "  Usman Kabir ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI Stocks That Could Go Parabolic According to Financial Media.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\nOne of the primary growth drivers in the AI industry over the past few years has been the exponential increase in data generation. The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), social media, e-commerce, and various digital platforms has led to an unprecedented surge in data production. This vast amount of data serves as the fuel for AI systems, particularly in the development of machine learning models. Clive Humby, a venture capitalist, emphasized the critical role of data in AI development by famously proclaiming that data is the new oil. The ability to collect, process, and analyze large datasets allows AI algorithms to improve accuracy and deliver more sophisticated outputs.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nTo understand the AI revolution, it is also important to understand advancements in computing power. Moore\u2019s Law, which predicts the doubling of transistors on a microchip approximately every two years, has played a crucial role in enhancing the processing power available for AI applications - consider companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and their advanced node processing. The advent of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) - like the ones made popular by NVIDIA - has further accelerated AI development by enabling faster computation and more complex model training. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest hedge funds globally, says that these improvements in hardware have been a game-changer for AI.\nThe availability of massive investments in AI research and startups is also a key growth driver. According to a report by PwC, global investments in AI are expected to reach $15.7 trillion by 2030, with the technology contributing $6.6 trillion to GDP from increased productivity and $9.1 trillion from consumption effects. This influx of capital is spurring innovation and the commercialization of AI technologies across various sectors, from healthcare to finance. Prominent hedge fund managers are also taking note. Ken Griffin, the chief of Citadel Investment Group, says that AI is the most transformative technology of our time, and not just another bubble, but a structural shift in the economy.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst..\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks that have explosive growth potential according to financial news outlets. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. The company is using AI to improve the advertisement side of the business. This strategy appears to be bearing fruit. The tech giant recently beat market expectations on earnings for both the top and bottom lines, and also raised guidance for AI-related capital expenditures. Meta managed to grow twice as fast as rival Google in the ads space in the second quarter, even while reporting an increase in price per ad figures during the earnings call.\nThis effective AI strategy has caught the attention of market experts on Wall Street. Investment advisory Tigress Financial has a Strong Buy rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). In a recent investor note, the advisory highlighted that the cash flow of the tech giant was enabling ongoing investments in artificial intelligence initiatives that would drive user engagement, better content, and a more effective advertising experience.\nOverall META ranks 3rd\u00a0on our list of the AI stocks that could go parabolic according to financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Why Are Hedge Funds Bullish On This ESG Stock Now?",
        "Author": "  Sheryar Siddiq ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best ESG Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other ESG stocks.\nDefining ESG can sometimes be straightforward: it\u2019s a finance and investing approach centered on managing risks related to environmental factors, social issues, and corporate governance. Although the concept emerged about two decades ago through a collaboration between United Nations officials and the finance industry, who argued that addressing ESG risks like climate change, labor disputes, and poor corporate governance can safeguard investments, it wasn\u2019t until the late 2010s and into the 2020s that ESG evolved into a more proactive movement, rather than a reactive one.\nA report from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year on record, with the global average near-surface temperature reaching 1.45\u00b0C\u2014closer than ever to the 1.5\u00b0C lower limit set by the Paris Agreement on climate change. Another report from the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also reveals that climate-driven disasters are already surpassing scientists\u2019 initial predictions. This urgency has sparked increased interest in niche yet rapidly expanding sectors of ESG investing, such as climate-transition funds and catastrophe bonds. In 2024, global investment in clean energy is expected to hit a significant milestone, doubling the amount allocated to fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) 2024 World Energy Investment report forecasts that total global energy investment will surpass $3 trillion this year, with $2 trillion directed toward clean technologies like renewables, electric vehicles, and nuclear power. Furthermore, Bloomberg reports that global investment in the energy transition surged by 17% last year, reaching a record $1.8 trillion, with this growth trend continuing. Former VettaFi financial futurist Dave Nadig said:\n\u201cIf you solely look at climate as your window, you\u2019ll probably not end up not owning a lot of energy companies, not owning a lot of miners [and] not owning a lot of steel companies. So, you end up with something that looks like services, healthcare, and technology, which is a very strong bet to take.\u201d\nThat said, U.S. funds with ESG goals seem to be losing popularity as of late. Despite the broader stock market\u2019s gains, assets in the sector have dropped to around $335 billion, down from a peak near $365 billion at the end of 2021. Political criticism of ESG in the country has also has led some investors to reconsider their strategies within the sector. Moreover, ESG stocks are also grappling with other significant challenges, such as a key climate regulation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that is currently under legal dispute, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s resistance to including environmental risks in global financial regulations.\nHowever, despite criticism labeling the ESG sector as \u201cwoke\u201d investing, many U.S. firms remain dedicated to ESG initiatives. Investor interest also remains somewhat robust, as these funds continue to attract attention for considering both financial performance and environmental, social, and governance factors. While there have been big outflows from the sector, many institutional investors are approaching climate risks and opportunities in their portfolios with a heightened sense of urgency, with an August analysis published in the Harvard Business Review showing that nearly three-quarters of the corporate climate commitments announced in 2021 had been fully or partially achieved. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are among the top global underwriters of green bonds this year, while Bank of America, alongside other prominent investment banking firms, recently sponsored ESG-focused conferences in New York and Chicago.\nWith that in mind, ESG funds saw strong performance in the first half of the year, largely driven by their substantial investments in technology stocks. Most ESG funds that aren\u2019t focused on renewable energy tend to allocate more to tech stocks while maintaining a lower exposure to oil and gas stocks. In the first six months of the year, the S&P 500 rose by approximately 15%, and nearly 60% of this gain was driven by the majority of the \u2018Magnificent Seven\u2019, which are often among the largest holdings in ESG funds.\nOur Methodology\nTo create the list of top ESG stocks to buy now, we chose companies from the Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF and ranked them by their percentage weight in the fund, listed in ascending order. In addition, we used hedge fund sentiments regarding each stock to illustrate how well these stocks hold up in the eyes of hedge fund investors. These were taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q2 2024 database.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nPercentage of holdings in the fund: 2.51%\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks among the top five on our list of the best ESG stocks to buy now. The social media giant achieved net-zero emissions across its global operations in 2020 and is now focused on reaching net-zero emissions across its entire value chain by 2030. As part of this effort, Meta is actively engaging with its suppliers to decarbonize its supply chain, aiming for at least two-thirds of them to set Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)-aligned reduction goals by 2026.\nOn August 8, Loop Capital raised its price target for Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) from $550 to $575, while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. This upgrade follows Meta\u2019s strong financial performance, which showed impressive growth and outpaced other major advertising platforms, including Amazon Ads, for the second consecutive quarter.\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) also exceeded analyst expectations with its latest quarterly results, suggesting that its significant investments in AI are likely to yield further benefits. Following the results, Citi expressed increased optimism about Meta\u2019s prospects, citing gains in user engagement, monetization, and expanding margins. Citi subsequently raised its price target for Meta from $550 to $580.\nPolen Capital, an investment management company, released its second-quarter 2024 investor letter and mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\u00a0Here\u00a0is what the fund said:\n\u201cIn the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot,\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall META ranks 5th on our list of the best ESG stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT:\u00a0$30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley\u00a0and\u00a0Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's 10 Stock Picks You Need to Know.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Jim Cramer's other stock picks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer views the current market as highly unpredictable and easily swayed by even the slightest news. He acknowledges that while some sectors are thriving, others are struggling, making it a mix of the best and worst of times depending on the industry.\n\"Look, this market is so ridiculous that you could knock it over with a feather or take it up with a breeze. I wanted to borrow from Charles Dickens: \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\" But the simple fact is that this isn't the worst of times\u2014just the worst of times for stocks in certain industries, and the best of times for others. Or within the confines of some hideous action for the average, with the Dow sinking 626 points, the S&P plunging 2.12%, and the Nasdaq plummeting 3.26%. It was a nasty day, right into the close.\"\nCramer explains that a seemingly minor purchasing management report caused a widespread sell-off, particularly hitting cyclical stocks, homebuilders, and tech companies connected to AI. Despite the panic, Cramer emphasizes that these sectors, especially semiconductors, oil, and housing, are actually performing well. The sell-off, in his view, was driven by irrational fears that these strong performances won\u2019t last.\n\"Now, what makes this market so ridiculous in my eyes? We had some obscure purchasing management report that threw everything off this morning, causing a wholesale collapse of the cyclicals, along with the homebuilders and anything connected to technology, particularly the once-beloved data center plays with big AI exposure. Given the chaos after that manufacturing PMI number, you'd think the semiconductor, oil, and housing worlds were in free fall. But in reality, these companies are doing incredibly well. The sellers are just worried they won't stay good for long.\"\nHe attributes the market\u2019s reaction to what he calls \"pure stupidity,\" combined with the typical challenges the market faces in September. This seasonal weakness can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to exaggerated reactions. Cramer believes that while the economy is slowing, the Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates in the coming weeks, which could benefit sectors like homebuilding.\n\"Frankly, I think this action represents pure stupidity, combined with the fact that the market is typically challenged in September. That's what's going on here, something that's true empirically\u2014to the point where it can become self-fulfilling. That's how it felt today. Sure, the economy is slowing, but in a few weeks, the Fed's going to cut interest rates, and you'll wish you'd stuck with a lot of what was on sale today, like the homebuilders. They are the real winners in any move that would take down mortgage rates, which is what would happen if the Fed cuts.\"\nJim Cramer acknowledges that if a scenario like 1999 were to repeat, it could be disastrous for chipmakers and the tech industry surrounding AI. He respects Cembalest as one of Wall Street\u2019s top strategists but feels his comparison to the 1990s might be too harsh. Back then, many companies were spending recklessly, but today, the company and its clients are among the most financially stable companies in history. The company faces little real competition, with no other companies close to matching its capabilities.\n\"A repeat of 1999 would indeed be devastating for the company and all the tech that surrounds it. As much as I think Cembalest is the best pure strategist on Wall Street\u2014the best I've found\u2014I found this piece a little harsh because we had many fly-by-night outfits spending like drunken sailors back in the 1990s. Now, though, the firm and its clients are some of the most well-endowed companies ever. The company doesn't have any real competition, and no one is near them by their own proclamations.\"\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly emphasized that if tech giants don\u2019t invest now, they\u2019ll miss out on future opportunities when they lack the necessary infrastructure. He\u2019s proven that the company\u2019s platform pays for itself quickly, which was not the case in 1999.\n\"As the company's CEO Jensen Huang has pointed out many times, if the tech titans don't spend, they're out of luck when some great use cases come along, and they don't have the infrastructure for it. Remember, Jensen has proved that the platform pays for itself very quickly. That sure wasn't the case back in 1999, was it? Of course, the company's stock has become a total pariah right now after this amazing quarter because the world suddenly seems convinced that AI spending will peak soon, at which point it's all over but the shouting. \"\nDespite the firm's impressive recent quarter, its stock has become unpopular, with many believing that AI spending will soon peak and that the stock's rise was overblown. Investors seem eager to push the stock back to its early August lows, around $90 after the company only delivered a major upside surprise, not the massive one they had expected.\n\"Stocks are getting slammed because most investors think the company's run-up was too extreme, given that the company only reported a major upside surprise\u2014not the kind of insanely huge upside surprise they'd come to expect. The sellers are eager to take the company back to where it was trading during the last visit to the penalty box in the first week of August, with the stock ticking as low as $90 and change.\"\nCramer anticipates that sellers will return in force following news that the Justice Department has subpoenaed the company in an antitrust probe. However, he downplays this development, noting that such subpoenas are standard practice, questioning why the Justice Department didn\u2019t simply ask the company some questions instead.\n\"I'm sure the sellers will be right back tomorrow morning after we learned tonight that the Justice Department has hit the company with a subpoena over an antitrust probe. Now, who cares? That's standard practice. It's shot first, second, and third. Though with the company right now, no one's thinking, \"Well, wait a second, why didn't the Justice Department just ask them some questions?\"\nOur Methodology\nThis article covers a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he reviewed several stocks. It highlights ten large-cap companies that he recommended and looks at how hedge funds view these stocks. The article also ranks these companies based on the level of hedge fund ownership, from the least owned to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\nJim Cramer advises holding onto Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), noting that it remains relatively inexpensive compared to other major tech stocks, especially after recent developments with Alphabet Inc.\n(NASDAQ:GOOG). He suggests that if Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s stock price were to drop significantly, say by 100 points, it would be a good opportunity to buy more shares.\n\"You\u2019re going to hold Meta because it\u2019s not expensive, believe it or not. It\u2019s probably the least expensive of the mega caps, especially after what happened with Alphabet. Here\u2019s what I would say: if it went down, let\u2019s say 100 points, you should buy another 25 shares. I\u2019m not advocating selling it right here because there\u2019s too much in the pipeline that could be very good. We're on a down day, and a lot of people freak out on down days. So, stay the course.\"\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) presents a strong investment opportunity due to its leadership in social media, solid advertising revenue, and strategic focus on virtual and augmented reality. With popular platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has a vast and engaged user base, which drives significant ad revenue. In Q2 2024, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s advertising revenue reached $32 billion, demonstrating its effective ad targeting and the strength of its core business.\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s investment in virtual and augmented reality, particularly through its Reality Labs division, is a major growth driver. Projects like Horizon Workrooms aim to open new revenue streams and support long-term growth. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s continuous innovation in its product offerings ensures high user engagement and helps it stay competitive in the fast-changing tech world. Financially, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is robust, with Q2 2024 revenues of $35 billion and net income of $10 billion, reflecting its strong profitability and ability to invest in future opportunities.\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company\u2019s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street\u2019s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta\u2019s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns.\nOverall META ranks 1st\u00a0on our list of Jim Cramer's stock picks you need to know. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Text": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) share price has soared 176% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that.\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n View our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\nDuring five years of share price growth, Meta Platforms achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 28% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 23% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\nWe know that Meta Platforms has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.\nIt's good to see that Meta Platforms has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 76% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 23% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Meta Platforms  you should be aware of.\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Text": "By Ammu Kannampilly and Humphrey Malalo\nNAIROBI (Reuters) -A Kenyan court ruled on Friday that Facebook's parent company Meta could be sued in the East African nation over the dismissal of dozens of content moderators by a contractor.\nLast year the content moderators sued Meta and two contractors, saying they lost their jobs with Sama, a Kenya-based firm contracted to moderate Facebook content, for trying to organise a union.\nThey said they were then blacklisted from applying for the same roles at another firm, Majorel, after Facebook changed contractors.\nOut-of-court settlement talks between the moderators and Meta collapsed in October last year.\nThe case could have implications for how Meta works with content moderators globally. The U.S. giant works with moderators around the world tasked with reviewing graphic content posted on its platform.\nFriday's decision by the Court of Appeal upheld an earlier ruling by a Kenyan labour court in April 2023 that Meta could face trial over the moderators' dismissals, which Meta appealed.\nIt also upheld a separate ruling in February 2023 that Meta could be sued in Kenya over alleged poor working conditions, which Meta also appealed.\n\"The upshot of our above findings is that the appellants' (Meta's) appeals ... are devoid of merit and both appeals are hereby dismissed with costs to the respondents,\" the judges at the Court of Appeal said in their ruling.\nMeta and Majorel did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Sama said it was reviewing the decision and would provide a statement soon.\nMeta has previously responded to allegations of a poor working environment in Kenya by saying it requires partners to provide industry-leading conditions.\nMajorel has said it does not comment on pending or active litigation.\n\"Meta being sued in Kenya is a wake-up call for all Big Tech companies to pay attention to the human rights violations taking place along their value chains,\" said Mercy Mutemi, a lawyer for the content moderators.\nFoxglove, a British tech rights group supporting the moderators' case, said Meta had run out of road.\n\"We are excited the roadblocks are finally gone \u2013 and will support the 185 (contractors) every step of the road to the courtroom,\u201d Foxglove director Martha Dark said.\n(Reporting by Ammu Kannampilly and Humphrey Malalo; Writing by Hereward Holland; Editing by Alexander Winning and Aurora Ellis)\n"

        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\nIn contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. We can see that in the last three years Meta Platforms grew its EPS by 14% per year. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained.\nIt's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The good news is that Meta Platforms is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 12.9 percentage points to 41%, over the last year. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Meta Platforms.\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$1.4t company like Meta Platforms. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$193b. Coming in at 14% of the business, that holding gives insiders a lot of influence, and plenty of reason to generate value for shareholders. Looking very optimistic for investors.\nAs previously touched on, Meta Platforms is a growing business, which is encouraging. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. Still, you should learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Meta Platforms.\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Title": "3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Meta Platforms (META)",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\nMeta Platforms (META) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this social media company a great growth pick right now.\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 18%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 43.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 27.9%.\nGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.67, which means that the company gets $0.67 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.57, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Meta Platforms is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 19.8% this year versus the industry average of 7.4%.\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\nThe current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.3% over the past month.\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Meta Platforms a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThis combination indicates that Meta Platforms is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "Meta offers a glimpse through its supposed iPhone killer: Orion",
        "Author": "  Maxwell Zeff ",
        "Text": "For years, Silicon Valley and Wall Street have questioned Mark Zuckerberg's decision to invest tens of billions of dollars into Reality Labs. This week, Meta's wearables division unveiled a prototype of its Orion smart glasses, a form factor the company believes one day could replace the iPhone. That idea sounds crazy\u2026 but maybe a little less crazy than it did a week ago.\nOrion is a prototype headset that combines augmented reality, eye and hand tracking, generative AI, and a gesture-detecting wristband. Through micro LED projectors and silicon carbide lenses (which are quite expensive), Meta seems to have cracked a longstanding AR display challenge. The idea is that you can look through Orion \u2014 you know, like a pair of glasses \u2014 but also see application windows projected on the lenses that appear as if they're embedded in the world around you. Ideally, you can use your hands, eyes, and voice to navigate the environment.\nThough to be clear, Meta's Orion smart glasses are chunkier than your average readers, reportedly cost $10,000 a pop, and won't be available for sale anytime soon. We're talking years from now. All the technology in Orion is relatively young, and all of it needs to get cheaper, better, and smaller to work its way into a pair of smart glasses you can buy at the mall. Zuckerberg says the company has already been working on Orion for 10 years, but there's still no path to a sellable product.\nHowever, Meta is hardly the only company trying to put a smartphone replacement on your face.\nThis month, Snap unveiled its latest generation of Spectacles smart glasses, which are larger than Orion and have a more limited field of view. One former Snap engineer called the latest Spectacles \"obviously bad\" \u2014 though you can actually order them. Google hinted during its I/O conference in May that it, too, is working on a pair of smart glasses, perhaps a revamp of its failed Google Glass experiment from last decade. Apple is reportedly working on AR glasses that sound a lot like Orion. And we can't rule out Jony Ive's new startup, LoveFrom, which he recently confirmed is working on an AI wearable with OpenAI (though we don't know if they're glasses, a pin, or something else entirely).\nWhat's brewing is a race among Big Tech's richest companies to create a sleek pair of smart glasses that can do everything your smartphone can \u2014 and hopefully something more. Meta's prototype made two things clear: there is something there, but we're not \"there\" yet.\nThese devices are a notable departure from the Quest virtual reality headsets Meta has been pushing for years now, and Apple's Vision Pro. There's a lot of similar technology involved, like eye-tracking and hand tracking, but they feel completely different to use. VR headsets are bulky, uncomfortable to wear, and make people nauseous from staring at the displays. Sunglasses and eyeglasses, on the other hand, are relatively pleasant to wear and millions of Americans use them everyday.\nTo Zuckerberg's credit, he's been pushing the eyewear form factor for quite a long time, when it certainly was not popular to do so. It's long been reported that Meta's CEO hates that his popular social media apps have to be accessed through Apple's phones (perhaps leading to the ill-fated Facebook Phone). Now, Meta's competitors are also dipping their toes into eyewear computing.\nMeta's early investment here seems to be paying off. Zuckerberg gave a keynote presentation of Orion on Wednesday that we won't be forgetting anytime soon, filling a room full of skeptical journalists with electricity and excitement. TechCrunch has not demoed Orion yet, but initial reviews have been very positive.\nWhat Meta offers today is the Ray-Ban Meta: a pair of glasses with cameras, microphones, speakers, sensors, an on-device LLM, and the ability to connect to your phone and the cloud. The Ray-Ban Meta is far simpler than Orion, but relatively affordable at $299 \u2014 actually not much more than a regular pair of Ray-Bans. They're kind of like the Spectacles 3 that Snap released a few years ago, though the Ray-Ban Meta glasses appear more popular.\nDespite the vast differences in price and capabilities, Orion and Ray-Ban Meta are more related than you might think.\n\"Orion is really the future, and we ultimately want to go for the full holographic experience. You can think about Ray-Ban Meta as our first step there,\" said Li-Chen Miller, a VP of product at Meta who leads its wearables team, in an interview with TechCrunch. \"We really need to nail the basic things, like making sure it's comfortable, people want to wear it, and that people find value in it every day.\"\nOne of the things Meta is trying to nail with Ray-Ban Meta is AI. Currently, the smart glasses use Meta's Llama models to answer questions about what you see in front of you, by taking pictures and running them through the AI system alongside a user's verbal requests. The Ray-Ban Meta's AI features today are far from perfect: The latency is worse than OpenAI's natural-feeling Advanced Voice Mode; Meta AI requires very specific prompts to work right; it hallucinates; and it doesn't have a tight integration with many apps, making it less useful than just picking up my iPhone (perhaps by Apple's deisgn). But Meta's updates coming later this year try to address these issues.\nMeta announced it will soon release live AI video processing for their Ray-Bans, meaning the smart glasses will stream live video and verbal requests into one of Llama's multimodal AI models and will produce real-time, verbal answers based on that input. It's also getting basic features, like reminders, as well as more app integrations. That should make the whole experience a lot smoother, if it works. Miller says these improvements will filter up to Orion, which runs on the same generative AI systems.\n\"Some things make more sense for one form factor than the other, but we're certainly cross-pollinating,\" said Miller.\nLikewise, she says some of Orion's features may filter down as her team focuses on making the AR glasses more affordable. Orion's various sensors and eye trackers are not cheap technologies. The problem is that Orion has to get both better and more economical.\nAnother challenge is typing. Your smartphone has a keyboard, but your smart glasses won't. Miller worked on keyboards at Microsoft for nearly 20 years before joining Meta, but she says Orion's lack of keyboard is \"freeing.\" She argues that using smart glasses will be a more natural experience than using a phone. You can simply talk, gesture with your hands, and look at things to navigate Orion; all things that come naturally to most people.\nAnother device that was criticized for lacking a keyboard was, ironically, the iPhone. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer infamously laughed at the iPhone in 2007, saying it wouldn't appeal to business customers because it didn't have a physical keyboard. People adapted though, and his comments sound naive more than 15 years later.\nI think making Orion feel natural is definitely more of a goal than a reality at this point. The Verge notes in its hands-on review that windows occasionally filled the entire glasses lens, completely obstructing the user's view of the world around them. That's far from natural. To get there, Meta will have to improve its AI, typing, AR, and a long list of other features.\n\"For Ray-Ban Meta, we kept it very scoped to a few things, and then it does them really well,\" said Miller. \"Whereas, when you want to build a new, futuristic computing platform [with Orion], we have to do a lot of things, and do them all very well.\"\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/28/meta-offers-a-glimpse-through-its-supposed-iphone-killer-orion/\n"

        "Author": "  Cody Corrall and Morgan Little ",
        "Text": "Meta Connect 2024 is a developer-centric event featuring a keynote from CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He showcased new hardware and software to support two of Meta\u2019s big ambitions: AI and the metaverse. This included everything from new Quest headsets, updates to Meta\u2019s Llama AI model, and even a new fully AR glasses prototype.\nMeta Connect 2024 kicked off live at 10 a.m. PT Wednesday, September 25. You can watch the archive via Meta Connect\u2019s site, on Meta\u2019s developer Facebook page, and you can still dive into Horizon Worlds from your Meta Quest headset if you really want to feel the full immersion.\nWe\u2019ll be compiling all of the announcements and reveals out of Meta Connect 2024 below and will keep it updated throughout the event and after as more reactions and analysis arrive.\nIn a surprise announcement, Zuckerberg dramatically revealed Orion, which Meta says will eventually become the company's \"first consumer full holographic AR glasses,\" though they won't be arriving on any consumers' faces anytime soon. Touting Orion's light weight, compatibility for hand-tracking and eye-tracking, and most ambitiously, a neural interface, Zuckerberg also touted some impressed, and famous, early testers (including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang). The Orion glasses were presented as the future of Meta's AR efforts, with our own ongoing coverage of Meta Connect's final big reveal here.\nMeta's reveal of the Quest 3S was indicated by several pre-event leaks and confirmed during Connect 2024. The Meta Quest 3S comes as a less expensive alternative to the Quest 3, starting at $299 for a 128GB version and 256GB for $399. The entirely wireless headset is compatible with the existing library of Quest apps and games, though Meta was particularly enthusiastic about its mixed-reality features. With the reveal of the Quest 3S, the Quest 3 will drop from $649 to $499. Get our early impressions of the new Quest 3S here ahead of its October 15 ship date.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1838992643319021592\n\"With Quest 3S on the shelf, we\u2019re officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Pro. We\u2019ll be selling our remaining headsets through the end of the year or until they\u2019re gone, whichever comes first,\" Meta told TechCrunch about the discontinuation of two of their headsets in the wake of the Quest 3S announcement.\nMeta AI is finding its voice. Users can ask a question or otherwise chat with Meta AI out loud through Messenger, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram and get simulated vocal responses in return. The digital voice assistant will roll out with multiple voice options to choose from, including the AI voices of celebrities like Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Awkwafina, Kristen Bell, and Keegan-Michael Key.\nThe reveal comes a day after OpenAI announced the long-awaited rollout of its Advanced Voice Mode feature, with a new look and five new voices. And speaking of vocal announcements, Zuckerberg touted that Meta AI now has 500 million users.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1838999866724262105\nMeta\u2019s multilingual Llama family of models has reached version 3.2, signifying that several Llama models are now multimodal. Llama 3.2 11B and 90B can interpret charts and graphs, caption images, and pinpoint objects in pictures given a simple description.\nLlama 3.2 11B and 90B might be able to look at a map of a park and tell you how long a certain path is, or when the terrain could become steeper. Or, provided a graph showing a company\u2019s revenue over the course of a year, the models can quickly spotlight the best-performing months of the bunch.\nNotably, Llama 3.2 11B and 90B can\u2019t be accessed in Europe due to the EU\u2019s Act restrictions. As a result, several Meta AI features available elsewhere, like image analysis, are disabled for European users.\nRay-Ban\u2019s Meta smart glasses are getting upgrades as the company continues to try and make the case that the smart glasses can become the next big consumer device. At the forefront of the pitch is the addition of real-time AI video processing, which lets you to ask the Ray-Ban Meta glasses questions about what it can see in front of you.\nThe sunglasses will also be getting a smartphone-like reminder feature; live language translation between English and French, Italian, or Spanish; and full integration with music streaming apps like Amazon Music, Audible, and iHeart Radio.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1839038482968203550\nZuckerberg's evolution into a self-made fashionista was on full display during Meta Connect, with a shirt that spelled out: \"Act Zuck aut nihil,\" which for those not well versed in Latin, translates to \"either Zuck or nothing.\" The phrase is originally associated with Roman Emperor Julius Caesar, further cementing Zuckerberg as a Rome Guy.\nIn a feature that will be familiar to anyone following OpenAI, Google, and Apple's application of image-based searches, Meta showcased its AI's capacity to respond to prompts based on images, as well as edit photos provided to the AI based on feedback given by the user. It can also share them to Instagram Stories.\nIf you're on Facebook, you've probably seen a lot of AI recently, knowingly or unknowingly. There's an entire nascent industry around using it to generate engagement bait. Earlier this month, the label noting whether content has been edited using Meta's tools was shrunk down. And now Facebook will actually pitch you on AI content that it generates for you that it thinks you'll want to share or engage with.\nGoing a step beyond just translating captions, Meta announced a test that would use its AI translation tools to take creator content, create a translated dub, and sync the creator's lips accordingly. So far, the experiment is limited to creator videos made in the U.S. and Latin America, with translations between English and Spanish.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1839025828371308855\nIn what ended up being a surreal moment, Zuckerberg brought on creator Don Allen Stevenson III for a conversation on the stage, which then turned into a demo during which Zuckerberg interviewed an AI version of Stevenson while the real deal was right beside him.\nAmid the big AI reveals and hardware and announcements, Meta did dive into the broader purpose of Connect \u2014 building ties with its community of developers. As it continues to pitch developers on helping build out the Quest app store's offerings, Meta released new support for Android apps on the Quest, along with support for 3D and spatial apps.\nA number of new experiences were revealed for the Quest ecosystem at Meta Connect 2024, led by Batman: Arkham Shadow, which launches October 22 and will also be bundled with new Quest 3 and 3S purchases until April of next year. Beyond games with familiar concepts like Alien: Rogue Incursion for Xenomorph-filled horror and a remake of the zombie game Arizona Sunshine, Wordle of all things was announced for the Quest. The VR version of the daily puzzle will be free to play without a New York Times subscription.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1839008631263535499\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/26/meta-connect-2024-orion-glasses-quest-3s-headset-meta-ai-upgrades-ray-ban-meta-real-time-video-and-more-revealed/\n"

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have taken a beating over the past few days, merely weeks after a broader market selloff in the technology sector that shook the entire finance industry.\u00a0 Shares of several prominent AI companies like have all witnessed high single digit drops in the space of just 24 hours. The NVIDIA selloff has wiped nearly $300 billion off the market value of the company. The growth-heavy NASDAQ Composite has registered a more than 3% drop in a single day of trading. AI valuations are bloated, no doubt, and the recent bear market has erased nearly $1 trillion in value from AI firms in just a few hours.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nThe concerns around top AI chipmaker stem from recent reports that authorities in the US are growing uneasy about the near monopoly of the firm in terms of GPU provision. The stock's outperformance in this regard has delighted investors - the chipmaker is doing business with tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta - but it has invited the ire of the Justice Department. The department is speculated to be in the process of sending a subpoena to the company, binding the business to provide certain information, in relation to an antitrust case. The purchase of Run:ai, an Israeli firm specializing in GPU orchestration software, back in April is believed to be one of the bones of contention between the AI chipmaker and the government.\nMacro developments are also weighing on the AI stocks in the near term. Commodity markets around the world are absorbing less than impressive growth numbers from China, impacting prices of copper and rare earths. Copper and rare earth metals are extensively used in AI devices, from chips to batteries. Lates US manufacturing data also paints a not so good picture for factories. According to authorities, US manufacturing witnessed a further decline in new orders and rise in inventory during August, even as manufacturing overall contracted at a modest pace. In addition to these factors, new investment notes on AI from JPMorgan and BlackRock, questioning the ROI on ballooning AI capex, have also grabbed media headlines.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on latest news and analyst ratings.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. Latest reports suggest that Meta will inform users in Brazil how it will use their personal data to train generative AI models. The move came after authorities in the South American country suspended the new privacy laws of Meta over the use of personal data to train generative AI models. The disclosures will enable Meta to continue to offer generative AI tools to users.\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest firms in the world. The sheer scale of the firm is better understood by looking at daily active user numbers released by the company in the second quarter results. Meta hit 3.2 billion daily active users between March and June this year, with WhatsApp reaching 100 million monthly US users. The family of apps offered by the firm grew revenue by 22% annually in Q2 2024, driven by more than $38 billion in ad revenue.\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the trending AI stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Wall Street Bulls Look Optimistic About Meta Platforms (META): Should You Buy?",
        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Meta Platforms (META).\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.33, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 46 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.33 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\nOf the 46 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 40 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 87% and 2.2% of all recommendations.\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>The ABR suggests buying Meta Platforms, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.3% over the past month to $21.36.\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Meta Platforms may serve as a useful guide for investors.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors have had to tweak their portfolios as global central banks tweak their monetary policies in response to slowing inflationary pressure.\nUncertainty over the upcoming US election is another headwind that is fuelling volatility in the markets. Geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, have also weighed significantly, forcing some investors to resort to defensive investment plays.\nREAD ALSO: 12 Best Long-Term Stocks to Buy According To Warren Buffett and 10 Best Debt-Free Penny Stocks to Buy Now.\nNevertheless, the array of disappointing economic data led by weakness in the labor market has raised serious doubts about whether the US economy is overheating amid the high interest rates. With the economy creating partly 142,000 jobs and the unemployment rate at 4.25% in August, serious doubts were cast about the resilience of the US economy.\nInvestors need help understanding the state of the US economy, which had decelerated from the rapid expansion it experienced right after the pandemic when companies rushed to reopen and recruit new employees.\nReducing inflation has provided some relief for families struggling with rising costs. However, the job market has also slowed down, with fewer people being hired, wages increasing at a slower pace, and the duration of unemployment increasing as it becomes harder to secure employment.\nA survey carried out by CNBC indicates that the probability of the US economy experiencing a soft landing stands at 53% as the US Federal Reserve starts its interest rate cut cycle. According to Michael Englund of Action Economics, the US economy is growing much faster than expected, even as it stares at economic risks on the horizon.\nSource: pexels\nHowever, there is also a probability that the economy will plunge into recession at 36%, owing to the negative effects of the high interest rates. According to Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG US, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Power's legacy highly depends on him engineering a soft landing after keeping interest rates high for too long.\nAnalysts and economists share mixed opinions on whether the economy needs 25 or 50 basis points to start with to cure the effects of the high interest rate environment. The argument for beginning with a smaller cut is based on the assumption that the economy is fundamentally sound, as current and former FED officials argue.\nThey argue that starting with a 50-basis-point reduction could signal a deeper concern over the economy. It could prompt investors to expect quicker rate reductions, which could spark market booms that complicate efforts to combat inflation.\nOn the other hand, a bigger reduction might cause investors to believe wrongly that the Fed intends to lower rates by the same amount at its meetings in November and December. This could create an expectation that the Fed would move swiftly towards a neutral interest rate target, which is meant to neither stimulate nor decelerate economic growth, according to James Bullard, who served as the president of the St. Louis Fed from 2008 to 2023.\nAmid the monetary policy uncertainty and economic growth slowdown concerns, the US equity market has remained resilient and supported by solid financial results. The S&P 500 rallying by double percentage points affirms growing investor sentiment.\nThe artificial intelligence frenzy has been one of the main catalysts driving sentiments in the equity markets. Some stocks with exposure to AI have rallied by more than 50%. On the other hand, the FED cutting interest rates is expected to provide the much-needed fuel to sustain the upward momentum in the equity markets.\nThe best forever stocks to buy now are companies depicting solid revenue and earnings growth with low debt levels poised to generate long-term shareholder value.

These services currently reach 3.2 billion people daily.The social media giant has been taking a number of initiatives aimed at driving user base. A rich creator base has been a key catalyst for Meta Platforms. The company recently launched a Creator Lab in India (one of its biggest markets in terms of user base). Creator Lab is an educational resource designed by creators for creators.META is expanding Threads web features, including insights, multiple drafts and scheduling functions. These features will help creators easily plan content and connect with new and existing user bases.AI initiatives are gaining traction. META has expanded access to Meta AI, which is now available in seven new languages and 22 new countries.\n\u00a0\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\nAI data centers consume a lot of power. According to estimates from NVIDIA NVDA, hyper scalers, including META, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Google, plan to spend $1 trillion on data center upgrades related to AI. Hence, power consumption is expected to increase exponentially.Meta Platforms\u2019 AI initiatives require huge data-center-related spending. META currently expects a capital expenditure of $37-$40 billion for 2024, and is on track to spend more on developing its advanced models and largest AI services in the world.META is now focusing on expanding its use of geothermal energy as part of its commitment to using clean energy for work.In partnership with Sage Geosystems, Meta Platforms recently announced plans to boost geothermal power production in the United States. This collaboration aims to develop a geothermal system to provide emission-free power for data centers and help control rising electricity demand. The first phase is expected to come online by 2027, generating 150 megawatts.This agreement marks the first use of next-generation geothermal power in the United States, highlighting the potential of geothermal energy as a viable renewable resource across the country. As part of the deal, Sage Geosystems will supply carbon-free power to Meta Platforms\u2019 data centers using its patented Geopressured Geothermal System (GGS). Currently, geothermal energy is mainly used in Nevada, Utah and California.The GGS technology is preferred because it uses hot dry rock, which is much more abundant than the resources used in traditional hydrothermal formations. This abundance makes the GGS technology easy to scale and rapidly deploy in the United States and globally.As one of the biggest corporate purchasers of renewable energy worldwide, Meta Platforms has contracted more than 12,000 MW in renewable energy projects. This increases the effort to move toward a carbon-free economy by offering solutions that improve the environment.\nMeta Platforms reported a 22% year-over-year increase in revenues to $39.1 billion due to increased user interaction on its platforms, driven by AI-recommended content.\u00a0Instagram has become a significant revenue generator for Meta Platforms, driven by AI. Meta AI is used to recommend about 40% of the content that users see on Instagram. According to META, users have spent 24% more time on Instagram since the inception of Reels. AI is significantly enhancing Instagram's monetization efforts.\u00a0Messenger and WhatsApp are the most valued drivers for Meta Platforms. It is impressive how quickly small and medium-sized enterprises are utilizing WhatsApp Business. The growing use of these platforms for communication increases Meta Platforms\u2019 potential to enter and capitalize on the lucrative payments market.META's long-term success depends on executing progressive plans, including metaverse, AI integration and revenue diversification.

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the new buzzword that is attracting the attention of almost everyone on Wall Street. The sector, characterized by rapid growth, significant investment, and intense competition, has witnessed a surge in venture capital (VC) funding over the past few months. In 2023, global VC investment in AI startups exceeded $94 billion. This surge in funding reflects the strong belief that these investors have in the transformative potential of AI across various industries. Merger and acquisition activity in the field is also on the rise, with more than 1,100 such deals in 2023 alone. Larger tech companies are actively acquiring AI startups to bolster their capabilities in the shortest time possible.\nSome sector-specific numbers highlight the AI potential in minute detail. For example, in the healthcare universe, the AI healthcare market is projected to reach $102 billion by 2028, with startups focusing on diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. In finance, AI-driven financial services are expected to reach a market value of $26.67 billion by 2026, with startups focusing on fintech, fraud detection, and algorithmic trading. In the retail world, AI is revolutionizing through personalized shopping experiences and supply chain optimization, with the sector projected to grow at a 34.4% CAGR by 2030.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nHedge fund interest in AI has increased in the past few months, an indication of the long-term growth potential of the industry. During routine interviews with the media, investor conferences, and through their 13F activity, hedge fund managers have detailed their bullish views on AI. For example, Bill Ackman, the chief Pershing Square Capital Management, has said that AI startups represent the next frontier in technology, offering unparalleled opportunities for innovation. He adds that the key is finding those with a clear vision and the ability to execute in a rapidly evolving landscape.\nSimilarly, Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates is of the opinion that the impact of AI on industries is undeniable, and the startups driving this change are in a unique position to capitalize on it. Dalio adds, however, that it's crucial to invest in those that are building sustainable, ethical models, as they will be the long-term winners. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment Corporation believes that AI startups are not just about tech but about transforming entire industries. He notes that the challenge is in navigating the hype and identifying the true innovators who have the potential to disrupt established markets.\nRead more about these developments by accessing Billionaire Stan Druckenmiller Is Betting On AI Infrastructure, Tobacco and Industrial Stocks and 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) engages in the development of products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables worldwide. It is considered one of the most influential companies in the world, with billions in daily active users across a host of social media platforms. The latest earnings report of the tech giant paints an interesting growth picture. The revenue and diluted earnings per share for Meta jumped in the second quarter this year, with a clear path for growth ahead as AI investments start returning. The firm has a net cash position of $40 billion, one of the highest in the tech space, and looks set to deliver cumulative returns of over 40% in the next two years.\nWall Street is also bullish on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in the long term. Tigress Financial recently raised the price target on the stock to $645 from $575 and kept a Strong Buy rating, highlighting that the increasing cash flow of the firm was enabling ongoing investments in artificial intelligence initiatives that drove increasing user engagement, better content, and a more effective advertising experience.\nOverall META ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks you should not have missed. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\nTop 5 Upgrades: \nMoffettNathanson upgraded Roku (ROKU) to Neutral from Sell with an $80 price target. The firm has advised clients to sell Roku's stock over much of the past three years due to a strong conviction that consensus was mismodeling the drivers of Platform revenues, compounded by \"incredibly poor financial disclosure,\" but it has softened its view as it looks into the second half of 2024 and 2025.\nDA Davidson upgraded Datadog (DDOG) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $140, up from $115. The firm's proprietary developer data showed a strong positive inflection point for Datadog, which gives the firm confidence in the trajectory of demand.\nWedbush upgraded Dine Brands (DIN) to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $47, up from $34. The firm believes the company's current sales challenges are well understood and reflected in the stock's \"depressed valuation.\"\nSusquehanna upgraded Coherent (COHR) to Positive from Neutral with a price target of $120, up from $80. The firm believes new CEO Jim Anderson, and his platform optimization program, will \"ultimately transform the company's long-term financial model,\" potentially providing the company with over 1,000 basis points of net margin expansion.\nGoldman Sachs upgraded Ford (F) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $13, up from $12. There is a margin opportunity driven by the company's more profitable commercial business - Ford Pro, with mid-teens EBIT margins - and growing software and services mix, and the management's cost actions in internal combustion vehicles and EVs can help to offset industry headwinds, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nRaymond James downgraded Disney (DIS) to Market Perform from Outperform. The firm sees demand moderating at the company's amusement parks after a strong post-COVID surge and says the shares are expected to remain range bound as it contends that consumers are still digesting price increases taken in the past roughly four years.\nWells Fargo downgraded General Dynamics (GD) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $317, down from $334, as the firm is cautious on the company and Boeing (BA) into the Q3 results. General Dynamics' 2024 guidance looked tough to hit at mid-year, and since then G700 deliveries appear to be well behind plan, Wells tells investors in a research note.\nCiti downgraded Hologic (HOLX) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $85, down from $95. The firm believes current fiscal 2025 estimates are too high and will likely need to be lowered, driven by normalization of demand.\nCiti downgraded HP Inc. (HPQ) to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged price target of $37. The firm cites a more cautious view of the PC recovery in the second half of 2024 for the downgrade.\nOppenheimer downgraded Global Payments (GPN) to Perform from Outperform following analyst coverage transfer. Despite the recent stock pullback, the firm remains cautious on Global Payments, particularly as the acquiring industry remains \"intensely competitive.\"\nTop 5 Initiations: \nPivotal Research initiated coverage of Meta Platforms (META) with a Buy rating and $780 price target. The firm sees a \"strong\" revenue growth outlook from increased usage, new products, better targeting and higher prices, boosted by cost efficiencies and eventually materially declining Reality Labs losses combined \"with what appears to be an attractive valuation.\"\nPivotal Research initiated coverage of Alphabet (GOOG) with a Buy rating and $215 price target. If \"the status quo holds,\" Alphabet appears to be in a \"very strong competitive position with a deep moat\" around its dominant core search business model and an \"obvious path\" to leverage its global device presence, strong artificial intelligence platform and \"financial might\" to increase financial incentives to handset manufacturers for default AI placement, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nOppenheimer initiated coverage of SharkNinja (SN) with an Outperform rating and $120 price target. The firm notes the company's management team has executed quite well delivering consistent and well above expectation results in recent quarters, even in difficult U.S. consumer durables backdrop.\nPiper Sandler initiated coverage of Labcorp (LH) with a Neutral rating and $235 price target. The firm sees LabCorp as leading the industry in diagnostics services for decades, but with the stock's run over the last six months, Piper thinks the risk/reward is balanced at these levels.\nArgus initiated coverage of Snowflake (SNOW) with a Hold rating. The company is in a building phase as it invests in new product enhancements, particularly around AI/machine learning which are not generating near-term revenue, even though they may begin to payoff sometime in the future, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n"

        "Author": "  Blue Chip Portfolios ",
        "Text": "Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), arguably the greatest investor of all time, has said, It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a wonderful company that I believe is trading at a fair price. It operates a highly profitable, capital-light business with a wide moat around it. Moreover, the company has a number of potential growth drivers which should allow it to grow earnings per share at an above-market rate over the next decade.\nAs the world's leading social media company in terms of reach and profitability, its key platforms include Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. In total, Meta's platforms have a total daily active people count of 3.27 billion. The company's primary revenue source is advertising sales and it generates roughly $11.89 of revenue each quarter per daily active person on its platforms. The business is not highly capital intensive and has delivered very strong returns on invested capital historically.\nMeta Platforms is a global business which derives roughly 37% of its revenue from the U.S. Europe accounts for roughly 23% of total revenue. Key international markets outside the U.S. and Europe include India, Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico.\nMeta Platforms has a wide moat around its business, driven by network effects and data. People tend to be active on social media platforms as it allows them to engage with the world around them. Its main platforms have massive scale, making them attractive for individuals who are new to social media and want to engage with people they know as well as build new connections. Comparably, smaller platforms do not offer individuals the same level of reach and often struggle to grow as they do not have the critical mass that existing platforms already have.\nThe company's large number of users also gives it a massive amount of data, which it then uses to sell targeted advertising. The value proposition of a smaller network is more challenging to advertisers as they simply have less data and users to target. Meta's significant advertising revenue provides strong cash flows that can be reinvested into the business to enhance its offerings.\nFor these reasons, it is very hard to new entrants to emerge in the social media space. A key exception has been TikTok, which was launched in 2016 and has grown to have an estimated 1.50 billion monthly active users. However, it should be noted the platform is somewhat complementary to Meta's offerings as TikTok content is often shared on Instagram. Moreover, its emergence as a leading competitor (though one with significantly fewer users) has not hurt Meta Platforms much as the company continues to deliver solid user expansion and revenue growth. Over the past decade, the social media giant has grown revenue and earnings per share at annual rates of roughly 33% and 36%.\nMeta Platforms has a number of key growth drivers that will allow it to continue generating solid earnings growth. Perhaps the most significant growth opportunity for the company is to expand its average revenue per user outside of the U.S. and Canada. As of the most recently disclosed figures, on a quarterly basis, the company generates roughly $68 per user in the U.S. and Canada compared to just $23.10 per user in Europe, $5.50 per user in Asia and $4.50 per user in the rest of world. Given the low revenue per user outside of the U.S., Canada and Europe, I believe Meta is well positioned to benefit from growth in emerging economies such as India, which has the most Facebook users of any country.\nAnother key growth driver for the company is artificial intelligence, an opportunity of which CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed on the second-quarter earnings call:\nAcross Facebook and Instagram, advances in AI continue to improve the quality of recommendations and drive engagementIn this quarter, we rolled out our full screen video player and unified video recommendation service across Facebook, bringing Reels, longer videos, and live into a single experience. And this has allowed us to extend our unified AI systems, which had already increased engagement on Facebook Reels more than our initial move from CPUs to GPUs did AI is also going to significantly evolve our services for advertisers in some exciting ways. It used to be that advertisers came to us with a specific audience they wanted to reach, like a certain age group, geography, or interests. Eventually, we got to the point where our ad systems could better predict who would be interested than the advertisers could themselves. But today, advertisers still need to develop creative themselves. And in the coming years, AI will be able to generate creative for advertisers as well. And we'll also be able to personalize it as people see it Moving on to some of the brand new experiences that AI enables, last quarter we started broadly rolling out our assistant Meta AI, and it is on track to achieve our goal of becoming the most used AI assistant by the end of the year.\nMeta Platforms currently trades at 23.50 times consensus 2024 earnings per share and 20.50 times consensus 2025 earnings per share. Comparably, the S&P 500 trades at roughly 22.50 times consensus one-year forward earnings. Thus, on a relative basis, Meta is trading at a modest discount to the broader market. I do not believe this discount is warranted given the wide moat around Meta's business and significant long-term growth prospects.\nIn addition to being reasonably priced relative the broader market, I also find Meta to be reasonably priced compared to peers. Perhaps the closest peer company is Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) given the fact it is the other dominant player in the online advertising business. Currently, Alphabet trades at roughly 20 times full-year earnings per share and 17.50 times consensus 2025 earnings per share. I believe Meta deserves to trade at a premium to Alphabet due to its stronger position in AI and lower degree of regulatory risk. Moreover, the technology represents a key threat to the search business as services such as ChatGPT could result in a reduction in search traffic in the future.\nAnother relevant peer comparison is Snap (NYSE:SNAP), which trades at 23 times consensus 2025 earnings per share. While Snap is expected to experience faster near-term earnings growth than Meta, the company has a historically struggled to meet analyst estimates and deliver profitability.\nMeta is also trading at a discount to its historical median valuation over the past 10 years of roughly 31 times earnings per share and thus is reasonably valued versus its own historical valuation norms. Consensus estimates currently call for the company to deliver earnings per share growth of 14.40% for 2025, 15% for 2026 and 8.70% for 2027. I view these estimates as too conservative given the strong potential growth tailwinds the company has due to AI and international monetization.\nOne key risk to the Meta Platforms bull case is regulatory risk. As the leading social media platform globally with limited competition, Meta is exposed to potential antitrust litigation due to its strong market power. Thus far, regulations in Europe have been the most aggressive in terms forcing Meta to change how it operates as it was forced to roll out an option for users to pay and use its platforms ad free. European Union regulators have recently accused the company of failing to comply with the recently enacted Digital Markets Act regulations. If Meta is found to have violated the law, it could be subject to a fine of up to 10% of its global revenue.\nMeta Platforms also faces ongoing regulatory challenges in the U.S. from the Federal Trade Commission as it has been accused of monopolizing the social networking market via the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The company has responded by arguing there is no evidence to support FTC claims and has asked the court to dismiss the case. The outcome of the case remains to be seen and thus, represents a significant risk for Meta. That said, even in the unlikely scenario in which Meta was forced to break itself up, I do not believe shareholders would suffer substantial losses as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp would each be highly valuable standalone businesses due to their scale and user data.\nMeta Platforms is a wonderful company with a bright future. The company enjoys a wide moat around its business due to network effects and the vast amount of user data it has access to. Despite posting more than 30% annual earnings growth over the past decade, the company continues to have significant growth potential related to increased monetization in developing markets as well as AI.\nThe stock trades at a modest valuation discount to the broader market and at a discount relative to its median historical valuation. Moreover, I also believe the stock is trading at a reasonable valuation relative to peers such as Alphabet and Snap. Thus, investors currently have an opportunity to buy a wonderful company at a fair price.\nRegulatory risks remain key a concern that investors should monitor, but the strength of each of Meta's platforms on their own suggests shareholders would not experience a significant erosion of value in the unlikely event of a forced breakup of the company.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n"

        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer\u2019s 10 Handpicked Stocks to Watch.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Jim Cramer's other handpicked stocks.\nIn a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer expressed concern that there\u2019s too much negativity in the market despite recent movements. He pointed out that while the Dow gained 38 points on Wednesday, the S&P fell 1.16%, and the NASDAQ dropped 3%, people seemed overly focused on what was going wrong. Although he\u2019s not calling it a market bottom, he suggests it\u2019s worth paying attention to what\u2019s going right.\n\"On a day when the Dow inched up 38 points, the S&P dipped 1.16%, and the NASDAQ declined 3%, I\u2019m willing to declare that there\u2019s too much doom and gloom out there. Look, I\u2019m not trying to call a bottom, let\u2019s make that crystal clear, but I think it\u2019s worth taking a hard look at what\u2019s actually going right\u2014not just what\u2019s going wrong.\"\nCramer emphasized that even though the market has been strong this year, heading into a historically tough election season and the worst month of the year means it\u2019s not the time to declare everything is fine. He noted that according to his trusted S&P oscillator, which measures overbought or oversold conditions, the market isn\u2019t oversold yet, so it's risky to go all-in.\n\"Sure, the market\u2019s up a lot this year as we head into a tricky election period and historically the worst month of the year. So, only a fool would ring the all-clear bell. Plus, we aren\u2019t even oversold yet\u2014at least not according to the S&P oscillator I swear by, which gauges whether there\u2019s too much buying or selling compared to normal times. You don\u2019t go all-in when the market is overbought like it is now; that rarely works.\"\nCramer also countered the idea that a recession is inevitable due to the Federal Reserve\u2019s struggle to control the economy. He agreed the economy is slowing, which is why consumer packaged goods and utility stocks are rallying while more sensitive sectors are struggling.\n\"At the risk of sounding too bullish, let me refute some of the biggest and baddest stories out there. First, let\u2019s tackle the popular narrative that the economy is slowing at a faster pace than the Federal Reserve can control, leading to an inevitable recession. That\u2019s why consumer packaged goods stocks and utilities are rallying while economically sensitive stocks have been crushed. I won\u2019t deny that the economy is weakening.\"\nHowever, he stressed that a Fed rate cut is meant to counter economic weakness, not strength, and hoping for a rate cut while ignoring the downturn is unrealistic. He added that if the upcoming labor report is weak, recession-proof stocks may surge, but if it\u2019s strong, hopes for a rate cut will fade.\n\"But let\u2019s be realistic: You can\u2019t hope for a Fed rate cut without acknowledging that there\u2019s going to be some economic fallout. The Fed doesn\u2019t cut rates when business is booming. That\u2019s foolish thinking. Rate cuts are meant to combat economic weakness, not strength. If Friday\u2019s labor report is weak, sure, we might see a huge rally in the so-called \"recession-proof\" stocks. But if the non-farm payroll number is too strong, forget about any rate cut hopes. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\"\nOur Methodology\nThe article summarizes a recent episode of Jim Cramer's Mad Money, where he discussed and recommended several stocks. This article focuses on ten companies that Cramer highlighted and examines how hedge funds perceive these stocks. The companies are ranked based on their level of hedge fund ownership, starting with the least owned and moving to the most owned.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) lost $251 billion in market capitalization on February 3, 2022. However, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has since rebounded significantly, climbing 116%, while the S&P 500 only gained 23% over the same period. Cramer used this example to illustrate that major market dips can lead to substantial future gains for investors who buy in during these downturns.\n\"Stocks can\u2019t stabilize until these weak shareholders sell out. History shows that significant market drops like this tend to offer great buying opportunities. For example, Meta Platforms shed $251 billion in market cap on February 3rd, 2022, but since then, it's rallied 116%, outperforming the S&P's 23% gain over the same period.\"\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is leveraging its vast user base and leading position in digital advertising to achieve substantial growth. In Q2 2024, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) reported record revenue of $32 billion, a 12% increase from the previous year, driven by robust digital ad sales. Its net income more than doubled to $9.2 billion from $4.4 billion a year earlier, with earnings per share reaching $3.29, surpassing analyst expectations.\nThis financial performance is bolstered by a rise in daily active users to 3.07 billion across its platforms. A major factor behind Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s positive outlook is its focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has made significant strides with AI-powered advertising tools that improve targeting and ad efficiency. Additionally, AI-driven content recommendations on Instagram and Facebook Reels have increased user engagement. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s investment in the metaverse through its Reality Labs division is also a key growth driver, aiming to create an immersive digital environment.\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company\u2019s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street\u2019s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta\u2019s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns.\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of Jim Cramer's handpicked stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\u00a0\nREAD NEXT: $30 Trillion Opportunity: 15 Best Humanoid Robot Stocks to Buy According to Morgan Stanley and Jim Cramer Says NVIDIA \u2018Has Become A Wasteland\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDisclosure: None.

        "Text": "We recently published a list of\u00a010 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper.\u00a0Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\nBillionaire\u00a0David Tepper\u00a0stands out amongst American hedge fund managers for his two recent moves: his bet on Chinese stocks despite their volatility and underperformance and his early arrival at the AI party.\nDavid Tepper\u2019s passion for investing goes all the way back to his high-school days. He once recalled:\n\u201cI remember my dad had made some small investments in a few companies, so I would track them and see how he was doing.\u201d\nTepper bought his first stock when he was in high school \u2014 100 shares of a $2 stock, \u201cbut then the whole thing went bankrupt,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt was a bad investment, but that didn\u2019t deter me.\u201d\nToday, Tepper is worth about $20 billion. He was piling into AI stocks when they were just getting started. This wasn\u2019t a fluke or a one-off success from the billionaire. Data from Bloomberg shows that Tepper has posted annualized returns of 28% for investors, before fees. In 2022, when markets were tumbling amid inflation storm and rising interest rates, Appaloosa returned 12.5%. Tepper\u2019s instincts and grip over financial markets were strong even when he was in his late 20s and 30s, raking in huge profits for Goldman Sachs, which he\u2019d joined in 1985.\nTepper rose to fame at Goldman when his portfolio stood out in the midst of the market crash of 1987.\nAccording to\u00a0The Alpha Masters: Unlocking the Genius of the World\u2019s Top Hedge Funds, written by Maneet Ahuja, Tepper recalled:\n\u201cGoing into the crash I had set up my entire portfolio as just short\u2014I had no long positions. I made a fortune during and after the crash,\u201d he says with a chuckle. \u201cIt was very cool.\u201d Unfortunately, the rest of the firm didn\u2019t do as well. \u201cI still got a raise but not as much as I should have.\u201d\nTepper\u2019s fund Appaloosa Management has released its latest holdings data and it\u2019s time to see which AI stocks are in the billionaire\u2019s portfolio. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\u00a0(see more details here).\nPixabay/Public Domain\nBillionaire David Tepper\u2019s Stake: $471,445,700\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) crushed past analyst estimates for its latest quarterly results, giving signs that the huge AI spending it\u2019s doing would bear more results in the future. After the results, Citi said it remains \u201cincrementally positive\u201d on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares due to engagement and monetization gains, along with expanding margins. The firm raised its price target for META to $580 from $550.\nJPMorgan said it sees AI benefiting Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) at three levels: core Family of Apps (FoA) improvements, new opportunities and experiences, and scaling the Metaverse. It also upped META price target to $610 from $480.\nMorgan Stanley also liked how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is improving its recommendation systems and quality with AI.\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company\u2019s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it\u2019s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year\u2019s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year\u2019s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot,\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled\u00a010 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Carolina Panthers Owner Billionaire David Tepper.

        "Author": "  Ramish Cheema ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of Cantor Fitzgerald's Top Internet Stocks: Best Stocks To Buy According To $13.2 Billion Firm.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Cantor Fitzgerald's other top Internet stocks.\nThe rise of the internet and its ubiquity in our daily lives is perhaps the greatest technological innovation of the 21st century. The transformation of the internet into what can very well be described as a utility was unthinkable even during the peak of the dotcom era; however, the firms that started back then or those that leveraged it to mold their business model are among the largest and most valuable companies in the world right now.\nThe clearest example of this comes through the share price of the world's largest eCommerce retailer. Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, this stock ranks 1st on our list of Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. Its market capitalization currently sits at a cool $1.96 trillion, and while it doesn't make it the most valuable company in the world, the firm's unique ability in being able to merge the high volume and total addressable market (TAM) components of the eCommerce and logistics industry with the high growth, high margins offered by cloud computing has introduced a lot of stability into its shares. So much so that its peak to trough share price fall this year wiped off 19% of its value, while Wall Street's favorite AI GPU designer marked a much sharper 27% drop. In absolute terms, this internet stock has delivered 2,077x in returns since its IPO, which is a cool way to turn a dollar into two grand.\nYet, it's still not the only internet stock that's transformed Wall Street and the world. Two other dominant internet stocks are the world's largest social media company founded by Mark Zuckerberg and the world's largest search engine provider set up by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Since they started trading, these two firms' shares are up by 1,275% and 5,608%, respectively while their founders are among the richest individuals in the world.\nThis is the power of the internet. It has spurred new industries, created billionaires, and even has its currencies through cryptocurrencies. Safe to say, the internet is here to stay, whether it's for posting memes or gaining access to healthcare from remote locations. But even though it's been around for nearly three decades now, like the broader industry, the internet continues to evolve and open new frontiers.\nWhile it's lost some steam as the world dealt with the dual crises of the pandemic and high interest rate, the advent of fifth generation (5G) internet technologies is believed to expand the use of the internet across a diverse range of industrial and consumer applications. As per McKinsey, the Internet of Things (IoT) industry could create a value ecosystem that is maximally worth $12.5 trillion by 2030 end. Within this, factory usage of IoT accounts for more than a quarter of the value pie or $3.3 trillion. Application wise, the research firm believes that business to business or B2B applications hold the greatest potential for IoT value creation as they account for 65% of its value creation estimate.\nOf course, the industrial sector is not the only one that's being disrupted by the internet. Another key area where it is making its impact is banking. One of the oldest industries in the world, banks stand neck in neck with governments when it comes to bureaucratic processes, high overhead costs, slow decision making, and slow response times. This has proven to be quite a disadvantage for banks, as according to additional research conducted by McKinsey, internet companies like Google and Tencent are already offering banking related services where they can. Additionally, banks are also being challenged by financial technology firms, with the number of such companies growing from 25 in 2017 to 274 in September 2022 for a combined market value of $1 trillion. This shift to digital banking has also impacted traditional bank valuations, with bank stocks trading at a 70% discount in 2022. The research firm believes that banks that are successfully able to transition to a digitized model can unlock $20 trillion in benefits.\nThese benefits have already manifested. For instance, by adding language processing software to its business, one bank was able to remove 360,000 lawyer hours. As a whole, it is estimated that through digital banking, commercial banks can improve their margins by as much as 25 percent. For the banking industry, these are life or death improvements as during the 15 years that ended in 2022, bank margins had dropped by 25 percent and are on track for another 20 percent decrease over the next decade.\nFinally, due to its ubiquity, internet stocks cannot be classified in one category. They range from social media firms to eCommerce companies, streaming services, and cloud providers. All these firms have their unique valuation drivers, which means that consumer exposure and heavy enterprise spending often prove to be the few broad based catalysts that apply to all firms. On this front, Cantor Fitzgerald, a firm that managed $13.2 billion in assets as of December 2023 has started to focus on some top internet stocks.\nDriving its strategy is the belief that \"despite strong performance over the last 18 months, valuations in internet names are fairly reasonable and should benefit from the expectation for upcoming rate cuts, tempered by decelerating top-line growth and as benefits from widespread cost-cutting fade.\" So let's take a look at Cantor's top internet stocks.\nOur Methodology \nTo compile our list of Cantor Fitzgerald's top internet stock picks, we ranked the firm's 22 internet stocks by their share price upside for Cantor's share price target for all the stocks except for stock number 17. This is because the share price target for this stock wasn't available, and as a substitute, the average analyst share price target was used to calculate the upside/downside percentage.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 219\nShare Price Target Upside: 26%\nCantor's Rating: Overweight\nCantor's Share Price Target: $660\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the dominant player in the global social media industry and owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. As per Cantor, it is one of the strongest players in the artificial intelligence industry and can capture market share. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s AI products and services are built on its Llama foundational model - which is also among the few truly open source AI models in the world. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is using Llama to add value for advertisers on its bread and butter platform Facebook, and it is also aiming to target social media users through products such as AI Studio to allow them to create their own AI variants. Cantor believes that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) can create AI growth over the next two to three years, and adds that the firm's fiscal 2025 P/E ratio of 20 implies that investors have factored in the risk of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) failing to adequately monetize AI and ad revenue growth slowing down.\nEvercore analyst Mark Mahaney shared how Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is monetizing AI during a recent talk with CNBC:\n\u201cIf you look at what happened with Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). they went to almost 30% revenue growth, they are growing dollar-wise faster than anybody else that\u2019s because they used AI to rebuild their ad-tech stack because they used AI to rebuild their user interface and get us more engaged, so it actually worked for them.\u201d\nOverall META ranks 4th\u00a0on our list of Cantor Fitzgerald's top Internet stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "Title": "Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Recent Stock Performance Looks Decent- Can Strong Fundamentals Be the Reason?",
        "Author": "  editorial-team@simplywallst.com (Simply Wall St) ",
        "Text": "Most readers would already know that Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) stock increased by 4.3% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company\u2019s long-term financial health, we decided to study the company\u2019s fundamentals to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Meta Platforms'  ROE.\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Meta Platforms is:\n33% = US$51b \u00f7 US$157b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.33 in profit.\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company\u2019s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\nFirst thing first, we like that Meta Platforms has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 7.1% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 13% net income growth seen by Meta Platforms over the past five years.\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Meta Platforms' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 11% in the same period, which is great to see.\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is META worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether META is currently mispriced by the market.\nMeta Platforms has a low three-year median payout ratio of 3.9%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 96% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.\nWhile Meta Platforms has been growing its earnings, it only recently started to pay dividends which likely means that the company decided to impress new and existing shareholders with a dividend. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 9.1% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 23% over the same period.\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Meta Platforms' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "Author": "Reuters ",
        "Text": "(Reuters) - Meta Platforms' Oversight Board said on Wednesday the Facebook parent should not automatically remove a phrase seen by some as displaying solidarity with Palestinians and by others as an endorsement of violence against Jews.\nThe board, which operates independently but is funded by the U.S. social media firm, said the phrase \"From the river to the sea\" has several meanings, and as such its use cannot in itself be deemed to be harmful, violent or discriminatory.\nThe phrase refers to the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, between which lie Israel and the Palestinian territories. It is often chanted at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.\nCritics of the phrase say it is antisemitic and a call for Israel's eradication. Other groups dispute that interpretation.\n\"Context is crucial,\" said Oversight Board co-chair Pamela San Martin. \"Simply removing political speech is not a solution. There needs to be room for debate, especially during times of crisis and conflict.\"\nThe Oversight Board said it came to the conclusion after it had reviewed three cases involving content posted on Facebook by different users containing the phrase.\n\"We welcome the board's review of our guidance on this matter,\" Meta said in a statement. \"While all of our policies are developed with safety in mind, we know they come with global challenges and we regularly seek input from experts outside Meta, including the Oversight Board.\"\nAlex Abdo, litigation director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University that promotes free speech, called the decision by the board \"thoughtful (and in my opinion, correct).\"\nThe Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, said the decision was \"short-sighted.\"\n\"Usage of this phrase has the effect of making members of the Jewish and pro-Israel community feel unsafe and ostracized,\" it said.\nThe board also called on Meta to improve access to data for journalists and researchers, less than a month after Meta discontinued CrowdTangle, a tool widely used to check misinformation and conduct research on content on Meta's platforms, including Instagram.\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)\n"

        "Author": "  Maxwell Zeff ",
        "Text": "Meta's AI-powered Ray-Bans have a discreet camera on the front, for taking photos not just when you ask them to, but also when their AI features trigger it with certain keywords such as \"look.\" That means the smart glasses collect a ton of photos, both deliberately taken and otherwise. But the company won't commit to keeping these images private.\nWe asked Meta if it plans to train AI models on the images from Ray-Ban Meta's users, as it does on images from public social media accounts. The company wouldn't say.\n\"We're not publicly discussing that,\" said Anuj Kumar, a senior director working on AI wearables at Meta, in a video interview with TechCrunch on Monday.\n\"That's not something we typically share externally,\" said Meta spokesperson Mimi Huggins, who was also on the video call. When TechCrunch asked for clarification on whether Meta is training on these images, Huggins responded, \"we're not saying either way.\"\nPart of the reason this is especially concerning is because of the Ray-Ban Meta's new AI feature, which will take lots of these passive photos. Last week, TechCrunch reported that Meta plans to launch a new real-time video feature for Ray-Ban Meta. When activated by certain keywords, the smart glasses will stream a series of images (essentially, live video) into a multimodal AI model, allowing it to answer questions about your surroundings in a low-latency, natural way.\nThat's a lot of images, and they're photos a Ray-Ban Meta user might not consciously be aware that they're taking. Say you asked the smart glasses to scan the contents of your closet to help you pick out an outfit. The glasses are effectively taking dozens of photos of your room and everything in it, and uploading them all to an AI model in the cloud.\nWhat happens to those photos after that? Meta won't say.\nWearing the Ray-Ban Meta glasses also means you're wearing a camera on your face. As we found out with Google Glass, that's not something other people are universally comfortable with, to put it lightly. So you'd think it's a no-brainer for the company that's doing it to say, \"Hey! All your photos and videos from your face cameras will be totally private, and siloed to your face camera.\"\nBut that's not what Meta is doing here.\nMeta has already declared that it is training its AI models on every American's public Instagram and Facebook posts. The company has decided all of that is \"publicly available data,\" and we might just have to accept that. It and other tech companies have adopted a highly expansive definition of what is publicly available for them to train AI on, and what isn't.\nHowever, surely the world you look at through its smart glasses is not \"publicly available.\" While we can't say for sure that Meta is training AI models on your Ray-Ban Meta camera footage, the company simply wouldn't say for sure that it isn't.\nOther AI model providers have more clear-cut rules about training on user data. Anthropic says it never trains on a customer's inputs into, or outputs from, one of their AI models. OpenAI also says it never trains on user inputs or outputs through its API.\nWe've reached out to Meta for further clarification here, and will update the story if they get back to us.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/30/meta-wont-say-whether-it-trains-ai-on-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-photos/\n"

        "Author": "  Danny Vena, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The biggest driver of the market rally since early last year has been the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). Many of the world's largest companies have been investing heavily to stake their claim in the resulting windfall. However, lurking just behind the scenes are concerns about the state of the broader economy and what it might mean for the short-term direction of the stock market.\nWith that as a backdrop, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) was off 2.8%, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) fell 3.3%, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) tumbled 3.6%, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) slumped 6.8% as of 3:10 p.m. ET.\nTo be clear, there was nothing in the way of company-specific news driving these so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks lower today. This supports the conclusion that investors are reacting to a report that suggested the broader economy was slowing faster than expected.\nThe monthly jobs report, courtesy of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed that total nonfarm payrolls increased by 142,000 during the month of August, up from 89,000 in July, but well below economists' forecasts of 161,000. The unemployment rate came in as expected at 4.2%.\nAt first glance, this would appear to be good news. A weakening jobs picture suggests the economy is slowing, which makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will begin to cut interest rates next month. Thus far, the Fed has been reluctant to reduce rates until it was certain that it was winning its battle against a red-hot economy that was accompanied by relentless inflation.\nThe headline numbers show growth is slowing, which gives the Fed cover to begin its long-awaited rate cuts. However, the devil is in the details, and other revelations in the report gave investors pause.\nOne of the more troubling factors was the speed at which the labor market has been weakening. The government released revised figures for the months of June and July, showing 86,000 fewer jobs were created over those two months than originally believed.\nThe Fed has been trying to slow rampant inflation without tipping the economy into a recession, thereby engineering a so-called \"soft landing.\" The evidence thus far has suggested the Fed was on track to achieve this lofty goal, but the downward job revisions show the economy is cooling faster than originally believed. That increases the likelihood -- however remote \u2013- that a recession could still occur.\nAs recently as July, the major market indexes were regularly tapping new all-time highs, but some investors see the worsening jobs picture as a warning bell and are taking profits as a cautionary measure.\nSo, what does this have to do with Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Tesla? The common thread that weaves the Magnificent Seven collective together is their potential to exploit AI. Each of these companies has been spending heavily to establish a beachhead in the AI revolution -- and it's easy to understand why.\nEstimates vary wildly, but one of the more conservative takes suggests the market for generative AI could be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\nThis will represent a veritable windfall for businesses at the cutting edge of this technology. However, many smaller companies have been reluctant to invest in new and emerging technology until the economy is stabilized, and today's mixed data did little to provide those assurances.\nYet the future looks bright for our Magnificent Seven companies:\nAmazon and Alphabet are two of the \"Big Three\" cloud infrastructure providers and, as such, are well positioned to provide AI services to their cloud customers, reaping the financial rewards.\nMeta Platforms collected reams of data from the billions of users on its social media platforms to develop its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), which the major cloud providers pay to offer on their platforms.\nTesla has been working for years to perfect its Full Self Driving (FSD) technology, which is fueled by AI. The company recently announced that it will launch FSD in Europe and China as early as next year, thanks to the latest developments in AI.\nFinally, there's the matter of valuation to consider, and not all Magnificent Seven stocks are created equal. Alphabet and Meta Platforms are currently selling for 20 times and 24 times forward earnings, extremely attractive multiples, particularly in light of the opportunity. Amazon stock is selling for less than 3 times sales, which is also an appealing price. Tesla stock is expensive no matter how you slice it, at 90 times forward earnings and 7 times sales, so it isn't for every investor.\nThat said, if Tesla is the first to crack the code for self-driving cars, its current valuation may end up being meaningless.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Text": "Meta AI's Imagine features, which use generative AI to turn text prompts into images, are now being expanded across Facebook and Instagram, the company announced at Meta Connect 2024 on Wednesday. With the update, users will be able to use prompts to generate AI photos directly in their feed, Stories, and for their Facebook profile pictures.\nThe new capabilities could help users and creators call more attention to their posts and shares by allowing them to generate fanciful and eye-catching images to accompany their text. Once the images are shared, friends and followers can see them and react to them or even mimic them, Meta says.\nFacebook users already upload photos of characters, animals, or something else besides their own photo as their profile picture to better protect their privacy. Now they won't have to seek out such a photo: They can simply generate one.\nThe AI can also suggest captions for Stories on Facebook and Instagram, as a part of this update.\nThe image generation capabilities will come to Messenger, too, to create personalized chat themes. This is accessed by tapping on \"Themes\" in the chat. Before, users could change the background of their chats as well as the color of the text bubbles, but Meta AI offers far more options in terms of the types of images that can be used.\nMeta says it's also testing new AI-generated content in Facebook and Instagram feeds where it will display AI images created for users based on interests and trends.\nThis is largely designed to push people to try Meta AI by tapping on a suggested prompt to reimagine the photo or by swiping to generate content in real time using Meta Imagine AI.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg remarked during the event that Meta AI differentiates itself not only by offering \"state-of-the-art AI models but also unlimited access to those models for free, integrated easily into our different products and apps,\" he said.\n\"So Meta AI is on track to being the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of this year. In fact, it's probably already there. \u2026 We're almost at 500 million monthly actives, and we haven't even launched in some of the bigger countries yet,\" Zuckerberg added.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/meta-ais-genai-imagine-features-expand-across-facebook-instagram-and-messenger/\n"

        "Text": "What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), we liked what we saw.\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Meta Platforms:\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n0.30 = US$62b \u00f7 (US$230b - US$27b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2024).\nSo, Meta Platforms has an ROCE of 30%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 6.6% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n Check out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms \nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Meta Platforms compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Meta Platforms .\nIt's hard not to be impressed by Meta Platforms' returns on capital. The company has employed 95% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 30%. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If Meta Platforms can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.\nIn summary, we're delighted to see that Meta Platforms has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 169% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\nMeta Platforms does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Meta Platforms  that you might be interested in.\nIf you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.\nHave feedback on this article?

        "Author": "  Maham Fatima ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Reddit.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks.\nAs artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent in current world affairs, new patterns concerning its research and development strategies are also emerging.\u00a0Traditionally, academia has focused on basic research and education, while industry concentrated on applied research and commercialization. However, in recent years, the commercial sector's dominance in AI investment and research has raised concerns about the balance of power. The shift of researchers from academia to industry has also raised questions.\nAdvanced AI systems increasingly require large amounts of data, compute power, and funding resources that industry actors possess in greater quantities than academia and nonprofits. Hence, AI research, which was originally the domain of academia in the early 2000s is now being taken over by industry.\nWe recently talked about this division in another article we published, 7 Most Popular AI Penny Stocks Under $5, here's an excerpt from it:\n\u201cA recent study from Stanford University found that businesses train AI models faster than academic institutions. In 2023, the industry-trained AI neared 51 significant machine learning models, while academia managed only 15. This trend persisted in 2024 despite rising training costs. ChatGPT 4, the latest model of ChatGPT, cost about $80 million to train. Google\u2019s Gemini Ultra cost around $191 million.\u201d\nA 2021 Stanford report says that the reason behind the blurring roles of academia and industry is that businesses come with affordable cloud computing, open-source libraries, and pre-trained models that incentivize university researchers to pursue commercial applications of their work. More and more industry papers are now appearing at conferences, raising concerns about applied research stifling long-term innovation or being biased toward corporate interests, all while also accelerating solutions for real-world problems.\nA 2023 paper in the journal Science states that businesses attract 70% of the top talent with PhDs in AI today, as compared to just 20% 2 decades ago. The number of AI research faculty in academia has stagnated, while industry hiring has surged 8 times since 2006. Industry models being substantially larger (about 29 times), indicating superior computing power, is a huge reason behind this.\nIn 2021, US government agencies allocated a total of $1.5 billion for academic AI research, while Google spent the same amount on a single project in just one year.\nThe largest AI models are now developed in industry 96% of the time. Leading benchmarks are also primarily industry-driven, accounting for 91% of the total. Furthermore, the number of published papers with industry co-authors has nearly doubled since 2000.\nYet, there's another anticipated shift as academic researchers are increasingly able to deploy their inventions in real-world settings. Duolingo, a language learning app developed by academics, is a successful example.\nA distinguished MIT professor, Fr\u00e9do Durand, believes academia can still be a driving force for innovation. He says that 25 years ago, the field of computer graphics in academia faced a similar resource imbalance where the industry created stunning visuals that academia couldn't match. However, instead of trying to mimic industry, academia took a different path and focused on ideas like advanced lighting simulations, fluid dynamics, and machine learning for animation. These seemingly outlandish ideas eventually became the foundation of modern rendering and graphics hardware.\nDurand believes this approach holds valuable lessons for AI research. He emphasizes the importance of academia pursuing unconventional approaches, openly sharing their work, and maintaining a sense of excitement about the field.\nHowever, he recognizes the challenges for academia and suggests potential solutions including increased government funding for academic research, shared research infrastructure, and strategies to keep top AI talent within academia. While industry seems to be taking over AI in general, collaborative partnerships with academia could yield better results. In one way or the other, AI will remain a hot topic in the coming times.\nMethodology\nTo compile our list, we sifted through several active subreddits to compile a list of 15 AI stocks to buy. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 219\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), formerly known as Facebook, is a multinational technology conglomerate that focuses on social media and online services and engages in the development of products that enable people to connect worldwide.\nTheir most well-known platforms include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, with over 3.2 billion users as of March. It monetizes through business users and AI-driven ad improvements and managed to grow twice as fast as Google in the ads space in Q2 2024, despite an increase in price per ad figures.\nIn the second quarter, the company saw a 7% increase in daily active users while achieving a remarkable 73% increase in earnings per share, and a 22.10% rise in revenue as compared to the prior year. This translated into a revenue of $39.07 billion. The revenue surge came from a 10% increase in both the number of ads served and the cost per ad. 219 hedge funds were long in Meta (NASDAQ:META) as of June 30. GQG Partners\u00a0is the top investor with a stake worth $5.4 billion.\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has acquired nearly 600,000 of Nvidia\u2019s H100 GPUs and is also developing its custom chip. It has introduced its own AI models, such as Llama, which is integrated into its apps and is available to external developers.\nIts strong user base, AI expertise, and advanced advertising drive its growth. Through these strengths and a focus on innovation, it is well-positioned for future success. The company's expansion into the metaverse, powered by AI and immersive technologies, creates new growth opportunities. Their AI-driven products, like Meta AI and Meta Smart Glasses, offer unique experiences to users.\nFred Alger Management\u00a0stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) operates the world\u2019s largest social network, with over 3 billion monthly active users across its platform. The company generates revenue predominantly from advertising. which accounts for over 95% of its total revenue, evenly split between North America and international markets. During the quarter, shares contributed to performance following the release of strong fiscal fourth quarter operating results, with revenues and earnings surpassing analyst estimates. The better-than- expected revenues were attributed to strong advertiser demand and Al-driven ad improvements. Moreover, the company materially raised its fiscal first quarter sales and earnings guidance above analysts\u2019 estimates, buoyed by continued strong advertiser demand trends and enhancements to Reels. Advantage+. Click-to-message, and Shop Ads. Further, management noted that ongoing investment in Al is enhancing user engagement and advertiser returns through improved targeting and measurement.

        "Text": "After soaring an incredible 194% in 2023, shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) are continuing to rise even higher this year, with the social media stock up another 47% since January. Meta has been one of the hottest tech stocks to own over the past couple of years and its valuation now sits at around record levels, with a market cap of more than $1.3 trillion.\nMeta owns some popular social media applications in WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram. But is the stock's current valuation justifiable, and can it go even higher, or has it reached a peak?\nThe bullish case for Meta Platforms is that with an impressive 3.3 billion daily active people, it possesses a lot of value for marketers who are trying to reach a certain target market.\nAnd Meta's business has been booming in recent quarters. After a bit of a slowdown in its growth rate in 2022, business has bounced back with the company now generating growth rates in excess of 20%.\nIn its most recent quarterly results (ended June 30), Meta Platforms' ad impressions rose by 10% year over year and its price per ad also increased by 10%. What has been even more impressive than its revenue growth has been improvement in the bottom line. Net income totaled $13.5 billion last quarter, rising by 73% year over year.\nIf Meta continues delivering this type of growth, it's hard to imagine the stock slowing down, especially since it's trading at relatively modest 27 times trailing earnings; the average tech stock is trading at an earnings multiple of 41.\nThings are going well for Meta Platforms stock right now but there could be trouble ahead. The ad market can be volatile and if concerns about a recession start to rise and advertisers pull back on spending, the company's impressive growth rate could start to nosedive the way it did back in 2022. And if the government doesn't end up banning TikTok, that could throw a wrench in Meta's promising growth opportunities.\nFor now, the company's operations are doing well and the strong ad revenue and profits from its Family of Apps business segment (which includes Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Messenger) are able to overshadow the losses from its cash-burning Reality Labs division (which focuses on the metaverse). But spending on that continues to loom large. If the ad business slows and those profits decline, there will be more of a spotlight on the struggling Reality Labs business, which incurred an operating loss of $4.5 billion this past quarter. Meta's Family of Apps segment, by comparison, generated $19.3 billion in profit.\nIn the long run, there are also question marks related to privacy and whether Meta is doing enough to protect children. Dozens of states are suing Meta for collecting data on children under the age of 13 without their parents' consent. And concerns are growing about the mental health risks associated with its social media platforms. This may not sound quantifiable in terms of lost revenue but Meta has amassed a lot of bad press over the years and the attention surrounding its addictive apps isn't going away.\nMeta's stock is doing well but this is also under ideal market conditions. It's investing in artificial intelligence and benefiting from that bandwagon, its ad business is also strong but that's with X (formerly Twitter) no longer being the same type of platform that it was before Elon Musk acquired it, and a looming TikTok ban is also likely keeping many advertisers away from Meta's biggest rival.\nEverything is lining up perfectly for Meta Platforms right now. But the stock's fortunes could reverse quickly in a slowing ad market (if a recession hits). And while the long-term risks may not appear measurable right now, they aren't worth ignoring, either.\nMeta's valuation may not seem all that expensive, but that could change if revenue and earnings numbers start to stumble. Although its share price may still climb a bit higher in the near future, this is a stock I'd avoid as the business faces an uncertain road ahead and its ability to withstand serious competition remains questionable.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  Jose Karlo Mari Tottoc ",
        "Text": "We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\u00a0In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other fast money stocks.\nAs the financial world grapples with shifting economic indicators and political uncertainty, insights from leading experts offer a crucial perspective on what lies ahead. With inflation showing signs of easing and the Federal Reserve signaling a likely rate cut, the focus now shifts to earnings performance and broader economic trends. Adding to this complexity are political developments, such as the possibility of a Republican sweep.\nThe latest June 2024 inflation report revealed a softer-than-expected outcome, causing varied reactions across major stock indices. Initially, futures surged in response, but have since fluctuated. Currently, the Dow is showing gains, the S&P is up slightly, and the NASDAQ is just below the flatline. Inflation dropped by a tenth of a percent month-over-month, contrary to economists' forecasts of a rise.\nChris Harvey, Head of Equity Strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, and Mike Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at JPMorgan, shared their perspectives on the current financial situation in an episode of CNBC's Fast Money. Chris Harvey is cautious about the concept of market rotation due to ongoing uncertainties about earnings. While he doesn't oppose rotation, he pointed out that investor confidence is still shaky.\n\"That\u2019s right. We\u2019re not against rotation; we\u2019re just waiting for more clarity. Many investors are uncertain about earnings. Until we see a situation where companies don\u2019t go down on bad news, we won\u2019t be fully convinced about the rotation. We want people to believe that numbers will improve and that things will get better. However, right now, bad news is bad news, and that suggests the rotation may not be sustainable.\"\nIn contrast, Mike Feroli discussed the anticipated rate cuts. He believes that the Fed is likely to lower rates soon due to its more aggressive stance. Feroli suggests that the economy is weaker than some might think, which supports the expectation of rate cuts. He noted that we have probably reached the peak for interest rates and that future attention will shift to earnings performance.\nFeroli also explained why he updated his forecast to September. This change is based on recent CPI data showing significant inflation drops over the past year and a rise in unemployment. He expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in September, with additional cuts likely on a quarterly basis.\n\"Yes, the rate cuts are coming. The Fed has signaled their intention to cut rates more aggressively than they have in the past. We also believe the economy isn\u2019t as strong as some might think, so we expect rates to come down. I think we\u2019ve already hit the peak for rates. Right now, it\u2019s really about earnings.\"\nHowever, if the labor market weakens further, the pace of these cuts could accelerate. Regarding the potential impact of a Donald Trump presidency and a possible Republican sweep, Feroli highlighted the uncertainties. A Republican sweep could lead to more tax cuts, possibly extending or expanding those from 2017, which might boost growth but also increase deficits.\nAdditionally, trade and immigration policies remain unpredictable. While deregulation might mitigate some negative effects, the overall policy environment is still uncertain. Finally, when asked about the implications of a Republican sweep for bond markets, Feroli expressed concern about the deficit trajectory. Extending all tax cuts, particularly in a more Republican-leaning scenario, could exacerbate the deficit problem.\nIn another episode of Fast Money, Chris Mman, Chief Investment Officer at Lafayette College, discussed the potential timing for Federal Reserve rate cuts, emphasizing that September appears to be a strong possibility. He notes, however, that the Fed will be influenced by upcoming economic reports. Mman also highlights concerns over equity valuations and the potential impact of delayed rate cuts on the labor market.\n\"I believe July should have been on the table based on today\u2019s report. However, the Fed usually prefers to signal their plans in advance. My expectation was that they probably wouldn't preemptively set up for September, but given today\u2019s report, it seems quite likely they will. The Fed might use upcoming meetings and communications to guide the market's expectations.\"\nAs political uncertainties, including the Democratic ticket's spotlight, add to the mix, Mman reassures that the Fed is likely to focus on economic data rather than political pressures. He stresses that while inflation remains a critical issue, the Fed's priority will be managing employment trends to avoid a deeper economic downturn.\n\"Even if inflation accelerates temporarily, it\u2019s unlikely to concern the Fed greatly. Currently, the focus has shifted more to employment reports rather than inflation. If employment were to unexpectedly strengthen, it could reduce the Fed\u2019s incentive to cut rates. Ultimately, the goal is to avoid a severe economic slowdown that would force them into aggressive rate cuts.\"\nOur Methodology\nIn this article, we review recent episodes of CNBC's Fast Money, where Fast Money traders highlighted stocks with high growth potential. We tracked each stock mentioned and ranked them based on frequency. From this, we identified the top 7 stocks that were mentioned a lot by Fast Money traders and were widely held by hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 219\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) dominates the social media space with platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, each attracting billions of users. This large user base creates substantial revenue opportunities through targeted advertising, a key driver of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s financial success. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s investment in the metaverse is a bold move aimed at unlocking new revenue streams.\nThrough its Reality Labs division, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is at the forefront of developing augmented and virtual reality technologies, which have the potential to transform online interactions. Although still in the early stages, these initiatives promise significant long-term growth as the metaverse concept gains traction.\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s strong financial performance this quarter highlights its leadership in the tech industry, driven by the innovative release of Llama 3.1, an open-source AI model. Llama 3.1, known for its better cost performance compared to leading closed models, could be a turning point for open-source AI, much like Linux was in its field. This innovation underscores Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s commitment to open-source development, which the company views as beneficial for developers, its apps, and the global community.\nFinancially, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) posted $39.1 billion in revenue, reflecting a 22% year-over-year increase, alongside a 38% operating margin and $13.5 billion in net income. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) also generated $10.9 billion in free cash flow and returned value to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. Meta Platforms Inc.

(NASDAQ:META) due to its strategic positioning and growth potential. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\u2019s dedication to evolving its platforms and exploring new technological frontiers indicates a promising future, making Meta an appealing choice for long-term investors.\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we established new investments in Broadcom and\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META). We previously divested from Meta during a period of stagnant advertising growth and the company\u2019s initial, significant investment in the metaverse project. At that time, investors appeared complacent to the risks associated to an increasingly competitive landscape, and the Street\u2019s robust financial expectations as the company transitioned towards monetizing short-format video (Reels). The subsequent decline in Meta\u2019s stock price during 2022 reflected these concerns.\nOverall META ranks 2nd\u00a0on our list of the best fast money stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other trending AI stocks.\nThe latest trends in AI stocks reflect optimism about the future of AI technology, with companies like NVIDIA continuing to dominate the space. The stock price of the chipmaker that is famous for selling AI GPUs has surged significantly in the past two years. After tripling in 2023, NVIDIA shares are up another 140% in 2024, pushing the market valuation of the firm close to $3 trillion. Analysts, like those at Bank of America, have increased their price target on the shares to around $1,500, citing the potential of NVIDIA to drive AI growth for years to come. Bank of America analysts believe the conversion of global data centers to AI-accelerated computing could require up to $500 billion annually, with NVIDIA playing a key role in this transformation\u200b.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed.\nProminent investment firms appreciate the significance of emerging AI trends. According to a report by Financial Times, investment titan Blackrock is exploring the launch of an AI-focused fund, in collaboration with tech powerhouse Microsoft and MGX, an investment firm based in Abu Dhabi. The primary aims of this fund are likely to include focus on creating data centers and funding energy infrastructure to support AI growth. NVIDIA is assisting Blackrock with estimating energy demands for new AI technologies. Analysts have forecast that energy constraints could be a potential roadblock to faster AI adoption. BlackRock will launch the fund with Global Infrastructure Partners, a firm it bought back in January for $12.5 billion.\nThe AI hype is truly global. Tech giant Amazon recently announced that it would invest \u00a38 billion in the United Kingdom over the next five years as part of a major push to expand data center infrastructure across the country. Amazon rivals like Google and Microsoft have also previously announced plans to boost data center infrastructure in the UK. The former plans to invest $1 billion in the UK while the latter has confirmed around \u00a32.5 billion to expand AI growth. Experts have stressed that AI is not just a short-term trend but a long-term transformative force. Francisco Bido, a top portfolio manager, recently underlined that AI was not a fad, noting the significant impact it had on both the top and bottom lines of many companies.\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks based on the latest news and analyst ratings.

        "Text": "By Katie Paul\nNEW YORK (Reuters) -Facebook owner Meta said on Monday it was banning RT, Rossiya Segodnya and other Russian state media networks from its platforms, claiming the outlets had used deceptive tactics to carry out covert influence operations online.\nThe ban, strongly criticised by the Kremlin, marks a sharp escalation in measures by the world's biggest social media company against Russian state media, after years of more limited steps such as blocking the outlets from running ads and reducing the reach of their posts.\n\"After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets. Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity,\" the social media company said in a written statement.\nA spokesperson for Alphabet's YouTube also said the company terminated over 230 channels affiliated with Rossiya Segodnya and AVO TV Novosti, which were already blocked from viewers.\nIn addition to Facebook, Meta's apps include Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads. Prior to the ban, RT had more than 7.2 million followers on Facebook and more than 1 million followers on Instagram.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday: \"Meta is discrediting itself with these actions. Such selective actions against Russian media are unacceptable. ... This complicates prospects for normalising our relations with Meta.\"\nMoscow branded Meta an \"extremist\" organisation in 2022 and blocked Instagram and Facebook, objecting to changes in Meta's hate speech policy designed to allow users to vent their anger over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nRussia has also criticized previous efforts by Meta to limit the reach of Russian media and fined the company several times for not removing content in Russia it considers illegal.\nMoscow's pre-existing bans on Instagram and Facebook may limit its ability to respond to Meta's state media block, but WhatsApp, which Russia has stopped short of banning so far, is used by millions of Russians.\nTelegram Messenger, whose Russian founder Pavel Durov was placed under formal investigation in France last month, is also widely used in Russia.\nVK Video, run by state-controlled tech firm VK, offers an alternative to YouTube, which has come under pressure in Russia over its own efforts to block Russian state media.\nThe White House declined to comment on Meta's move, which came after the United States filed money-laundering charges against two RT employees for what officials said was a scheme to hire an American company to produce online content to influence the 2024 election.\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday that countries should treat RT's activities as they do covert intelligence operations.\nRT has mocked the U.S. actions and accused the United States of trying to prevent the broadcaster from operating as a journalistic organisation.\nIn briefing materials shared with Reuters, Meta said it had seen Russian state-controlled media try to evade detection in their online activities in the past and expected them to continue trying to engage in deceptive practices going forward.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York; Additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington, Dmitry Antonov in Moscow and Alexander Marrow in London; Editing by Sonali Paul, Ros Russell, Mark Porter and Alistair Bell)\n"

Google, Apple, Samsung, and others all are working on AR glasses. Snapchat maker Snap unveiled its latest version of its AR Spectacles glasses at an event last week.\nSnap\u2019s Spectacles, and Meta\u2019s Orion glasses, do offer a fascinating look at the future of personal computing\u2014a future that now appears just years away. However, they also show why it\u2019s been so challenging for tech companies to make AR glasses, and why none of the big companies are ready to turn their prototypes into mass-market products just yet.\nOr as Zuckerberg put it this week: \u201cThe technical challenges to make them are insane.\u201d\nAt first glance, Meta\u2019s Orion glasses do look more or less like a regular pair of glasses, albeit somewhat oversize, with thick rims and temples. Once you put them on, you can see holograms overlaid over your view of the real world. These include a number of different apps, including Instagram, Facebook Messenger for chats and video calls, a web browser, videos, a retro space shooter, and a 3D game of Pong you can play against another person wearing the same set of glasses.\nMore impressive than the apps themselves is the fact that Orion can display up to three of them next to each other without forcing you to turn your head. That is because Orion\u2019s optics feature a 70-degree field-of-view, which is significantly wider than that of any other pair of augmented reality glasses currently in the market. Snap\u2019s new AR Spectacles, for instance, only have a 47-degree field of view, which forces users to frequently turn their heads when they look at AR objects.\n\u201cThe field of view is transformational,\u201d agrees Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag. \u201cIt addresses one of the biggest problems in AR.\u201d\nMeta\u2019s Orion glasses use eye tracking to help users navigate through menus, and come with a futuristic wrist-worn controller that looks a bit like a fitness tracker. The wristband measures electrical currents to identify nerve signals traveling to and from the brain, which makes it possible to track subtle finger movements that can then be used to navigate through Orion\u2019s on-screen menus.\n\u201cThis lets you do very small micro gestures,\u201d explains Meta\u2019s senior product management director Rahul Prasad. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hold your hand up in the field of view of the glasses, you can keep your hand down by your side.\u201d\nMeta also integrated hand tracking into the glasses, added an outward-facing camera to let AI recognize real-world objects, silicon carbide lenses for optimized optics, as well as custom-designed chips to minimize power consumption and achieve up to three hours of battery life.\nAll of this makes for a very impressive piece of technology, agrees Sag, who has tried dozens of different AR and VR devices over the years. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a pair of glasses that have this much capability,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is the most advanced in almost every way.\u201d\nHowever, integrating all of that advanced technology also comes with a significant downside. At this point, Orion would be much too expensive, and too hard to manufacture, to achieve mass-market scale.\u00a0The company only produced a small number of Orion glasses that will primarily be given out to company executives and employees. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be deploying it internally,\u201d Prasad says. \u201cIt becomes our time machine to learn what the future looks like.\u201d\nSnap isn\u2019t quite ready to sell its AR glasses to the public either yet; Spectacles are even bulkier than Meta\u2019s Orion glasses, and their internal battery lasts just 45 minutes per charge. Spectacles do have brighter and sharper AR overlays than Meta\u2019s Orion glasses, but their small field-of-view significantly reduces the sense of immersion.\nThat\u2019s why Snap is treating its AR glasses as a developer kit, and only making it available to AR developers willing to pay $99 per month for access to to the hardware via a subscription plan that comes with a one-year minimum commitment.\nMeta, meanwhile, has plans to sell the next version of Orion to consumers. The company is already trialing a higher-resolution version of the glasses, and also plans to make the glasses, which currently weigh about 100 grams, lighter and less bulky. But the biggest goal is a more affordable price. \u201cWe want to get the cost down significantly,\u201d says Prasad, suggesting that the device could cost about as much as a smart phone in the future.\nWhen that future will arrive is still unclear. This month\u2019s hardware introductions show that the industry still has a lot of work to do\u2014but they also prove that AR wearables are within reach, with Sag projecting that we could see consumer-grade AR glasses within the next three years.\n\u201cWhen you look at the chipsets, optics and display technologies, things are moving along much faster than they were two or three years ago,\u201d Sag says.\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.comSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http://fastcompany.com/newsletters\n"

        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 4, 2024 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Meta Platforms META, Lockheed Martin LMT and Eli Lilly LLY.\nThe 2024 Q2 earnings season is slowly grinding to a halt, with the majority of S&P 500 companies already delivering quarterly results. Looking ahead, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +3.8% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues, chaining together consecutive periods of positivity.\nSeveral companies have stolen the spotlight throughout the period, including Meta Platforms, Lockheed Martin and Eli Lilly. All three posted robust results and upped guidance, with shares of each seeing bullish activity post earnings.\nLet's take a closer look at each.\nMega-cap giant Meta Platforms was one of the few Mag 7 members to see a positive reaction to its quarterly results, with the company again exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations. The company's earnings outlook reflects bullishness across all timeframes.\nThe company delivered a stunning statement in the release, with Mark Zuckerberg saying, 'We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,\" \nHe continued, \"We've released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we're driving good growth across our apps.\" \nMeta also raised its CapEx outlook into a band of $37 - $40 billion ($35 - $40 billion prior) to support its artificial intelligence roadmap.\nThe valuation picture for META remains attractive, with the current 22.4X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 31.5X. In addition, the current PEG ratio works out to 1.2X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth.\nEli Lilly shares have been red-hot in 2024 thanks to robust results stemming from unrelenting demand, up 65% and widely outperforming relative to the S&P 500. Shares popped following its latest release, with earnings and sales climbing 85% and 35%, respectively.\nThe company upgraded its current-year sales guidance by a sizable $3 billion. Analysts have adjusted their sales expectations accordingly, with the now $46.4 billion expected alluding to a 35% climb year-over-year.\nThe story behind Eli Lilly has been driven by its diabetes drug Mounjaro and its weight loss injection Zepbound, which have seen unrelenting demand among consumers. Mounjaro sales jumped 216% year-over-year, whereas Zepbound sales of $1.2 billion also reflected strong demand.\nEarnings expectations have shot higher across the board following the release, with LLY sporting a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nLockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, operating in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and information technology. The company's steady growth continued throughout its latest period, with EPS and revenue growing 6% and 9%, respectively.\nThe company has been a long-time favorite among income-focused investors, consistently upping its payout over the years. LMT's cash-generating abilities have aided its dividend growth, with the company posting nearly $1.3 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest period.\nFollowing the favorable quarter, LMT upped its EPS, segment profit, and sales guidance, causing shares to move bullishly following the release.\nThe Q2 earnings season overall showed resiliency, with no major spooks hitting the tape. While we saw some mixed reads on the consumer, recent favorable economic data helps alleviate this issue.\nAnd concerning a few companies who stole the spotlight during the reporting period, these three stocks all did precisely that.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\nSee Stocks Free >>\nMedia Contact\nZacks Investment Research\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\nsupport@zacks.com\nhttps://www.zacks.com\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Meta publicly acknowledged the incident at the time and the DPC said the passwords were not made available to external parties.\n\"It is widely accepted that user passwords should not be stored in plaintext, considering the risks of abuse that arise from persons accessing such data,\" Irish DPC Deputy Commissioner Graham Doyle said in a statement.\nA Meta spokesperson said the company took immediate action to fix the error after identifying it during a security review in 2019, and that there is no evidence the passwords were abused or accessed improperly.\nMeta engaged constructively with the DPC throughout the inquiry, the spokesperson added in a statement on Friday.\nThe DPC is the lead EU regulator for most of the top U.S. internet firms due to the location of their EU operations in the country.\nIt has so far fined Meta a total of 2.5 billion euros for breaches under the bloc's General Data Protection Regulation's (GDPR), introduced in 2018, including a record 1.2 billion euro fine in 2023 that Meta is appealing.\n($1 = 0.8966 euros)\n(Reporting by Padraic Halpin, Editing by Kylie MacLellan)\n"

        "Author": "  Jessica Bursztynsky ",
        "Text": "Meta hosted its annual Connect conference on Wednesday, which highlighted the social media giant\u2019s push into its artificial intelligence and metaverse ambitions. CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at the developer-centric event to reveal a slew of new hardware and AI features.\nMost Read from Fast Company\nDog food recall update: Salmonella and Listeria fears spark nationwide product withdrawal and FDA warning\nThis Pittsburgh townhouse is only 16-feet wide but could help solve the housing crisis\nHurricane Helene tracker: Live maps and real-time tools show storm\u2019s path toward Florida\nFast Company rounded up a few key updates to come out of the flagship event.\nAmong the most exciting announcements of the day, Meta unveiled its Orion augmented reality glasses. The glasses, which aren\u2019t quite ready to hit the shelves, are composed of trendy frames that use projectors inside the frames to beam holographic displays.\nMeta says that beginning Wednesday and continuing throughout the year, it will open up access to its Orion product prototype for Meta employees and select external audiences to share feedback with its development team. It plans to begin shipping them in the near future.\n\u201cThese glasses exist, they are awesome, and they are a glimpse of a future that I think will be exciting,\u201d Zuckerberg said during the presentation.\nMeta\u2019s latest VR headset, the Quest 3S, was a feat.\nThe mixed reality device is launching at a lower starting price point of $300, yet with many of the same capabilities of its predecessor. And it\u2019s about $200 less than the cost of the Meta Quest 3, which also got a price drop.\nTo be sure, there are some concessions to the Quest 3 due to the price point. The Quest 3S has a bit less storage (though you can buy a model with additional storage for $100 more), and has a lower-resolution display.\n\u201cQuest 3S is the best headset for those new to mixed reality and immersive experiences, or who might have been waiting for a low-cost upgrade from Quest and Quest 2,\u201d the company said in a blog post that went up alongside the event.\nThe Quest 3S is available for preorder now and will be out on October 15. Meta is also discontinuing the Quest 2 and Quest Pro.\nMeta announced a series of software updates to its Ray-Ban smart glasses, including new features such as reminders and the ability to scan QR codes. For example, if you\u2019re looking at a pair of shoes in a store, you can tell your glasses to remind you to buy them next week, and Meta\u2019s AI will do so.\n\u201cWe keep updating the software and building out the ecosystem, and they keep on getting smarter and capable of more things,\u201d Zuckerberg said at Connect.\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.comSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http://fastcompany.com/newsletters\n"

        "Author": "  KELVIN CHAN ",
        "Text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Meta said it's banning Russia state media organization from its social media platforms, alleging that the outlets used deceptive tactics to amplify Moscow's propaganda. The announcement drew a rebuke from the Kremlin on Tuesday.\nThe company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said late Monday that it will roll out the ban over the next few days in an escalation of its efforts to counter Russia's covert influence operations.\n\u201cAfter careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets: Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity,\" Meta said in a prepared statement.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov lashed out, saying that \u201csuch selective actions against Russian media are unacceptable,\u201d and that \u201cMeta with these actions are discrediting themselves.\u201d\n\u201cWe have an extremely negative attitude towards this. And this, of course, complicates the prospects for normalizing our relations with Meta,\u201d Peskov told reporters during his daily conference call.\nRT, formerly known as Russia Today, and Russia Segodnya, also denounced the move.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cute how there\u2019s a competition in the West \u2014 who can try to spank RT the hardest, in order to make themselves look better,\u201d RT said in a release.\nRossiya Segodnya, the parent company behind state news agency RIA Novosti and news brands like Sputnik, said Meta's decision \u201cwas not unexpected for us.\u201d\n\"Meta is a deeply politicized organization. We will continue our work in the countries where we are present and this decision will not affect our work,\u201d Rossiya Segodnya said in a statement.\nMeta's actions comes days after the United States announced new sanctions on RT, accusing the Kremlin news outlet of being a key part of Russia\u2019s war machine and its efforts to undermine its democratic adversaries.\nU.S. officials alleged last week that RT was working hand-in-hand with the Russian military and running fundraising campaigns to pay for sniper rifles, body armor and other equipment for soldiers fighting in Ukraine. They also said RT websites masqueraded as legitimate news sites but were used to spread disinformation and propaganda in Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere.\nEarlier this month, the Biden administration seized Kremlin-run websites and charged two RT employees of covertly providing millions of dollars in funding to a Tennessee-based content creation company to publish English-language social media videos pushing pro-Kremlin messages.\nMoscow has rejected the allegations.\nMeta had already taken steps to limit Moscow's online reach. Since 2020 it has been labeling posts and content from state media. Two years later, it stopped Russian state media from running ads and putting their content lower in people\u2019s feeds, and the company, along with other other social media sites like YouTube and TikTok, stopped European Union users from accessing RT and Sputnik channels after the outlets were sanctioned by Brussels. Also in 2022 Meta took down a sprawling Russia-based disinformation network spreading Kremlin talking points about the invasion of Ukraine.\nMeta and Facebook \u201calready blocked RT in Europe two years ago, now they\u2019re censoring information flow to the rest of the world,\u201d RT said in its statement.\nMoscow has fought back, designating Meta as an extremist group in March 2022, shortly after sending troops into Ukraine, and blocking Facebook and Instagram. Both platforms \u2014 as well as Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter, which is also blocked \u2014 were popular with Russians before the invasion and the subsequent crackdown on independent media and other forms of critical speech. The social media platforms are now only accessible through virtual private networks.\n___\nDasha Litvinova in Tallinn, Estonia contributed to this report.\n"

        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META.\nAs of 2024-09-30, Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $679.28. It's currently trading at a price of $567.36. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 16.48%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$19.74\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.78%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 35.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n746.68\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n1199.18\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n679.28\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $647.87. This valuation indicates that the Meta Platforms Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 12.43%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

After the results, Citi said it remains \u201cincrementally positive\u201d on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares due to engagement and monetization gains, along with expanding margins. The firm raised its price target for META to $580 from $550.\nJPMorgan said it sees AI benefiting Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) at three levels: core Family of Apps (FoA) improvements, new opportunities and experiences, and scaling the Metaverse. It also upped META price target to $610 from $480.\nMorgan Stanley also liked how Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is improving its recommendation systems and quality with AI.\nThe market has been reluctant about Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) massive spending on AI. What does Meta want to achieve with its AI spending? The company wants to use AI to improve engagement and language models like Llama 3 to improve user interactions, boost engagement, and better monetize its 3.2 billion daily active users.\nBut can Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) sustain this high spending? The company\u2019s free cash flow margin is around 30%, and it\u2019s well on track to report $50 billion in free cash flow this year. Based on this target the stock is trading at around 26 times this year\u2019s free cash flow. Given the current trajectory continues Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) can post $58 billion in free cash flow by next year, which means the stock is trading at 21 times next year\u2019s free cash flow. With a whopping $35 billion in net cash, a strong user base, and a key position in the consumer-facing side of the AI industry, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) could be a solid long-term investment.\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its\u00a0Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cIn the second quarter, the top relative contributors to the Portfolio\u2019s performance were all names we do not hold: Home Depot,\u00a0Meta Platforms, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:META), and AbbVie. Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company\u2019s \u201cyear of efficiency,\u201d where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.\u201d\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey\u2019s list titled Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller is Buying and Selling These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Texas Instruments Inc. TXN, The Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW and IDT Corp. IDT.\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and The Charles Schwab Corp., as well as a micro-cap stock IDT Corp. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today\u2019s research reports here >>>Meta Platforms\u2019 shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Software industry over the year-to-date period (+51.1% vs. +15.7%). The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.META has been leveraging AI to improve the potency of its platform offerings. These services currently reach more than 3.2 billion people daily. User growth remained solid in the United States, with WhatsApp reaching more than 100 million monthly users and Thread approaching 200 million milestone.It witnessed good year-over-year growth across Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Meta now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)Shares of Texas Instruments have gained +19.0% over the year-to-date period against the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s gain of +94.4%. The company is benefiting from solid data center demand which is boosting its prospects in the enterprise systems market. Improving conditions in the personal electronics and communication equipment markets are a plus.Texas Instruments\u2019 growing investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages are tailwinds. Its deepening focus on manufacturing, advanced technology infusion, product portfolio expansion and consistent returns to shareholders, is another positive.However, widespread weakness in the industrial, and automotive markets is major concern. Sluggishness in its Analog, Embedded Processing and Other segments is a negative. Increasing manufacturing costs are hurting its profitability. Overall weak demand environment and growing U.S.-China tensions are concerns.(You can read the full research report on Texas Instruments here >>>)Charles Schwab\u2019s have underperformed the Zacks Financial - Investment Bank industry over the year-to-date period (-6.3% vs. +15.7%). As the company deals with low-yielding assets on its balance sheet, it plans to shrink itself to sustain profits and rely more on off-balance sheet arrangements to house deposits. This will likely put pressure on top-line expansion.The Zacks analyst project total revenues to increase just 1.7% in 2024. Also, elevated expenses are likely to hamper profitability. Though we estimate the total expense to decline in 2024, it will increase in 2025. Yet, higher rates will likely aid net interest margin (NIM) while rising funding costs and low-yielding assets will weigh on it. We project NIM to be 2.13% in 2024.Also, strategic acquisitions have increased the company\u2019s client assets. We estimate total client assets to see a CAGR of 6.9% by 2026. Also, sustainable capital distributions are encouraging.(You can read the full research report on Charles Schwab here >>>)Shares of IDT have outperformed the Zacks Diversified Communication Services industry over the year-to-date period (+12.0% vs. +8.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $ 965.16 million has high-growth, high-margin businesses which enhanced overall results, boosting consolidated gross margin by 310 basis points in third-quarter fiscal 2024.NRS, with over 30,000 active terminals and a 65.9% year-over-year increase in merchant services revenues, leads growth, indicating robust expansion and profitability. Positive adjusted EBITDA across segments underscores operational efficiency. IDT's consistent gross profit rise, cost management and technological advancements drive sustained growth.Yet, IDT faces risks from economic downturns, integration challenges, cybersecurity threats and international expansion. Declining traditional telecom revenues and rising operating expenses pose challenges.

        "Text": "At the Meta Connect 2024 developer conference in Menlo Park on Wednesday, Meta announced that it\u2019s expanding its AI-powered business chatbots to brands on WhatsApp and Messenger using click-to-message ads.\nNow businesses can set up ad-embedded chatbots that talk to customers, offer support, and facilitate orders, Meta says. \"From answering common customer questions to discussing products and finalizing a purchase, these business AIs can help businesses engage with more customers and increase sales,\" the company wrote in a blog post provided to TechCrunch.\nMeta continues to inject more of its ad products and tools with AI. In May, the company began letting advertisers create full new ad images with AI and insert AI-generated alternate versions of ad headlines. And in June, Meta began testing AI-powered customer support for businesses using WhatsApp, which automatically answers customer queries related to frequently asked questions.\nMeta claims that more than a million advertisers are using its AI ad tools and that 15 million ads were created with the tools last month.\nAI ads boost click-through rates, Meta says. But there's evidence to suggest customers may not like ads with chatbots. One survey commissioned earlier this year by customer experience platform Callvu found that the majority of people would rather wait at least a minute to speak with a live customer agent than chat instantly with an AI.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/meta-lets-businesses-create-ad-embedded-chatbots/\n"

        "Title": "Alphabet Vs. Meta Platforms: D.A. Davidson Selects the Superior \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019 Stock to Buy",
        "Author": "  TipRanks ",
        "Text": "It\u2019s no secret that the tech sector has been the main driver of the current bull market. Tech is heavily overrepresented in the market indexes, making up more than one fourth of the S&P 500 and an even larger proportion of the NASDAQ 100 \u2013 and the mega-cap Magnificent 7 stocks have been leading the way.\nThese are the 800-pound gorillas of the tech sector, known for their innovative products and their heavy investments in cutting edge technologies like artificial intelligence. With their deep pockets and deeper expertise, the Magnificent 7 tech stocks are among the leaders of the AI boom, and they\u2019re positioning themselves to leverage the transformations that AI is sure to bring, transformations that could be far greater than any past technological breakthrough\nBut some of these giants might represent a better opportunity for investors than others. With this in mind, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria is taking the measure of two Mag 7 shares, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) \u2013 and coming down to a recommendation on which one is the superior Mag 7 stock to buy right now. Here are the details.\nAlphabet\nFirst up, Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube and the dominant company in the fields of internet search and digital advertising. The company\u2019s success has pushed it to just under a $2 trillion market cap, making it the fourth-largest publicly traded firm on Wall Street and one of just 6 trillion-dollar-plus companies.\nEven on the top tier, companies have to work to maintain their position. Alphabet has been proactive at this, leveraging its tech experience and expertise to develop new tools and applications for a rapidly approaching future. Prominent among Alphabet\u2019s projects are multiple ventures into the world of AI.\nAlphabet is using AI to enhance the functionality of its internet search arm, combining generative AI with multimodal large language models to improve the capabilities of Google in both understanding requests and in delivering results. The company is also using AI tech in its online language translation services and in AI-powered text creation tools. The aim here is not solely to make Google or YouTube better, but also to develop a competitive edge against challengers such as Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine or against gen-AI content creators such as ChatGPT.\nAll of this is embodied in Alphabet\u2019s Gemini model, the company\u2019s strongest development of artificial intelligence. At its core, Gemini is a collection of large language models, and is designed to understand audio, images, text, video, and even code \u2013 all to give the most flexibility in the end use. Alphabet is working to integrate Gemini into all of its products, from Google to the Android operating system, and to put the model to use in chatbots, text generation, software coding \u2013 pretty much any form of content creation that an end-user can imagine. The key challenge for Alphabet will be maintaining market share as the search world shifts toward AI-powered tools.\nThis is an issue noted by Davidson\u2019s Gil Luria, who thinks there are reasons for caution here, mainly due to the company\u2019s uphill road in integrating AI technology into its products but also in the legal repercussions of its current near-absolute dominance of online search. Luria writes, \u201cWhile the company has maintained an almost monopolistic grip on the global Search market for years, many would argue that this dominance is under siege with the introduction of AI-enhanced search and chatbots. The rise of models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT, which has been tightly integrated into Microsoft\u2019s ecosystem, highlights this vulnerability inside of Google that despite its leadership in AI research and its massive data advantage, the company has struggled over the years to translate these assets into competitive commercial products at the same pace as its competitors.\u201d\nOf more immediate importance, the analyst sees problems piling up on Alphabet\u2019s horizon, and adds, \u201cShorter-term, Google will be navigating the transition from having 90% share in Search to something less than that as AI-enhanced Search becomes the new category. This transition will also become more difficult as it has to accommodate the DOJ charges that were specifically aimed at now allowing Google to sustain this monopoly during the transition.\u201d\nFor Luria, this adds up to a Neutral (Hold) rating for the stock, while his $170 price target points toward a one-year upside potential upside of 7%. (To watch Luria\u2019s track record, click here)\nAlphabet, like many of the major tech companies, has picked up plenty of interest from Wall Street\u2019s stock analysts \u2013 and there are 36 recent reviews on record for the stock. These include 27 to Buy and 9 to Hold, giving the shares a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $202.94 represents a gain of 27.5% from current levels. (See GOOGL stock forecast)\nMeta Platforms\nThe second stock on our radar here is the world\u2019s leading social media company, Meta Platforms. Through its main social media subsidiaries \u2013 Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp \u2013 Meta can reach more than one-third of the world\u2019s population. At the end of June this year, the company reported that its Daily Active People (DAP) across the family of platforms was 3.27 billion, an extraordinary number, and one that was up 7% year-over-year.\nThat huge reach supports Meta\u2019s core money-making business, its digital advertising sales. The company reported a 10% increase in the average price per ad, as well as a 10% increase in ad impressions delivered across the company\u2019s family of platforms in 2Q24.\nIn raw numbers, that translated into quarterly revenues of $39.07 billion, up 22% from the prior year and $760 million better than had been forecast. The company\u2019s Q2 bottom line came to $5.16 per share, beating the estimates by 40 cents per share.\nMeta and its founder Mark Zuckerberg have been leading the social media wave for the better part of two decades now \u2013 but the company is not resting on its laurels. Meta is also positioning itself as a leader in artificial intelligence technology. The company already uses AI to fine-tune and narrowly target its ad impressions, and also uses AI tech in translation algorithms to make the platforms accessible across languages. But in addition, Meta is also moving into generative AI and working to expand the audience for AI generally.\nThe company has developed an open-source AI model, Llama, and is already on Llama 3. The platform aims to make AI more flexible and more accessible; its open-source code allows users to tweak the platform to meet their own unique needs, as well as to publish improvements that everyone can use.\nMeta has also released the Meta AI, an AI assistant/chatbot, across all of its social media platforms, as a direct challenge to the gen AI leader, ChatGPT. Meta AI has seen successes, and at the end of August, the company reported that the AI chatbot had already reached 400 million monthly active users and 40 million daily active users.\nMeta\u2019s AI work is taking shape in the company\u2019s Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute technology platforms. The first of these integrates the infrastructure, models, and frameworks that the company will need to put together AI apps at the scale needed to serve an audience of billions, while the second refers to the AR, VR, and immersive environments \u2013 what the company calls its \u2018metaverse\u2019 \u2013 that will let users interact seamlessly with the AI. Llama and Meta AI are the current applications available \u2013 but Foundation and Spatial Compute are where the rubber meets the road, and Meta plans to follow that road to the next generation of AI tech.\nAll of this makes Meta Platforms, in analyst Luria\u2019s view, the superior Mag 7 stock for investors to buy right now. Luria says of this company, \u201cWe see META as a top pick within the mega-cap space, with a combination of emerging leadership in the most important future technology platforms and an attractive relative valuation\u2026 Meta\u2019s strategic positioning in AI Foundation Compute and Spatial Compute signals a forward-looking bet on the next wave of technological transformation, where scale, capital intensity, and platform control will define market leadership.\u201d\nGetting to the details, the analyst adds, \u201cIn AI Foundation Compute, Meta\u2019s scale and access to massive datasets, high-performance infrastructure, and specialized developer talent offer a distinct advantage while similarly, in Spatial Compute, Meta\u2019s multi-billion-dollar investments in Reality Labs and hardware platforms like Quest and Meta Ray-Bans give it the resources and ecosystem to shape this next computing paradigm, just as Apple and Google shaped mobile computing in the past decade.\u201d\nBased on this, Luria rates META stock as a Buy, and his $600 price target suggests that he sees a gain of 12% coming on the one-year horizon.\nOverall, the Street is also bullish on Meta. The stock has picked up 45 analyst recommendations lately, which include 41 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Going by the $584.82 average target, a year from now, shares will be changing hands for a 9% premium.

        "Text": "By Katie Paul\nNEW YORK - Facebook owner Meta Platforms is planning to announce this week that it has secured deals with actors including Judi Dench, Kristen Bell and John Cena to give voice to its Meta AI chatbot, a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters on Monday.\nThe new audio feature will offer users the option to select a voice for Meta's ChatGPT-like digital assistant from a list of five celebrities, who also include Awkwafina and Keegan-Michael Key, as well as several generic voice options, the person told Reuters.\nThe social media giant is set to announce the audio capabilities at its annual Connect conference, which starts on Wednesday, the person said.\nMeta is also expected to unveil a first version of its augmented-reality glasses at Connect this year and to discuss its road map for other hardware devices like its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which last year became its first product to include an audio version of the Meta AI chatbot.\nThe celebrity voices will start launching in the U.S. and other English-speaking markets this week across Meta's family of apps, which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, the source told Reuters.\nBloomberg first reported earlier this summer that Meta was in discussions with celebrities about using their voices for AI projects.\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg posted a promotional video featuring Cena on Instagram last week, showing the two men and several others engaging in stunts while wearing the Ray-Ban Meta glasses.\nMeta has been racing to push out generative artificial intelligence products to its billions of users, as it competes against Microsoft-backed ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Alphabet's Google to dominate the emerging technology. As part of that, the company has been adding capabilities to its chatbot and pushing to make it a more prominent part of the experience of using its apps.\nOpenAI showed off a similar audio feature for its chatbot in May, but quickly ran into trouble when actor Scarlett Johansson accused the company of making it sound \"eerily similar\" to her even though she had declined to lend her voice to the project.\nMeta's assistant is currently capable of engaging in text chats and generating images in response to user prompts. The company last year experimented with bringing star power to the project by launching text-based \"character\" versions of the chatbot inspired by celebrities like Paris Hilton and Snoop Dogg, although those never appeared to gain traction with users.\nMeta has since shifted focus to an AI Studio product that enables content creators on its platforms to create chatbot versions of themselves.\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)\n"

The firm sees the company's coastal exposure as a \"major positive given limited oncoming supply and healthy tenant demand.\"\nJefferies upgraded Relay Therapeutics (RLAY) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $16, up from $10.60, after the company reported interim data for RLY-2608. Management's thesis on higher selectivity equaling better safety and tolerability seems to have held up based on the data, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\nRedburn Atlantic downgraded Costco (COST) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $890, up from $860. The firm says that while Costco's ongoing comp and market share gains should continue to drive \"decent\" earnings growth, the stock's current risk/reward profile is \"skewing less favorably given the even higher than normal expectations\" priced into a starting point of a 50-times price-to-earnings ratio on fiscal 2025 estimates.\nGoldman Sachs downgraded Nutrien (NTR) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $53, down from $69, represents 14% upside from current levels. The company's retail segment could be a source of incremental volatility and risk over the next 12 months from potential increases in bad debt expense and loss reserves relating to NTR Financial, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nBarclays downgraded Methanex (MEOH) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $44, down from $56. The firm believes the OCI ownership will present overhangs on the stock.\nLake Street downgraded Limoneira (LMNR) to Hold from Buy with an unchanged price target of $25. Limoneira's operations continue to show solid improvement, its asset monetization strategy \"still has room to run,\" and its avocado expansion strategy is increasingly well considered, but the firm believes Limoneira is \"reasonably valued\" at a $450M market cap.\nBTIG downgraded Bionano Genomics (BNGO) to Neutral from Buy without a price target after the company announced its fourth workforce reduction since early 2023. The downgrade is driven by the ongoing challenging capital markets environment, particularly for small cap companies, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nTop 5 Initiations: \nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Alphabet (GOOGL) with a Neutral rating and $170 price target. As the company faces challenges in its core Search business, its opportunity will migrate to the rest of its portfolio, where its positioning is mixed, the firm tells investors in a research note.\nDA Davidson initiated coverage of Meta Platforms (META) with a Buy rating and $600 price target. The firm calls Meta a top pick within the mega-cap space, citing its \"combination of emerging leadership in the most important future technology platforms and an attractive relative valuation.\"\nSusquehanna initiated coverage of Dell Technologies (DELL) with a Neutral rating and $120 price target. The firm sees two risk factors that have led to its below-consensus EPS estimates, namely the economics of AI hardware remain uncertain and the strategy for scaling AI services remains unclear.\nBernstein initiated coverage of GE Aerospace (GE) with an Outperform rating and $201 price target. As a focused aerospace company, GE is \"set in a commercial aviation market at a uniquely positive time,\" the firm tells investors in a research note.\nCantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of MKS Instruments (MKSI) with an Overweight rating and $140 price target. The firm views MKS as the market leader in wafer fab equipment subsystems and substrate equipment. \n"

        "Text": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta agreed to buy up to 3.9 million carbon offset credits from Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual's forestry arm through 2038, the companies said on Wednesday in a statement.\nThey did not disclose the value of the deal. The average price for forestry carbon offsets last week was $4.22 per credit, according to data provider Allied Offsets. That could value the deal at up to $16 million based on that pricing.\nCarbon offsets allow companies to offset greenhouse gas emissions by paying for actions to cut emissions elsewhere to meet corporate climate goals. Each credit represents a reduction of one metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions.\nUnder the long-term contract signed by Meta and BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group (TIG), the owner of Facebook and Instagram agreed to buy 1.3 million carbon credits, with options to purchase an additional 2.6 million credits.\nMeta said the deal is its largest carbon removal transaction from a single project and is part of its commitment to reach net zero emissions across its value chain in 2030.\nThe credits were generated by BTG Pactual TIG's forest restoration projects in Latin America, where it has planted more than 7 million seedlings, according to the statement.\nIn June, TIG announced the sale of 8 million carbon credits to Microsoft in the largest-ever transaction of such credits worldwide.\nThe deals from Microsoft and Meta come even though demand for offsets broadly stalled last year.\nCompanies including food giant Nestle and fashion house Gucci have reduced their buying of credits amid widespread doubts that they served to reduce emissions.\n(Reporting by Andre Romani; Editing by Tom Hogue)\n"

        "Title": "Hybrid work is not the future, says Meta\u2019s former director of remote work: It\u2019s an \u2018illusion of choice\u2019",
        "Author": "  Jane Thier ",
        "Text": "Most companies would call a hybrid work plan\u2014in which two or three core days per week are spent in the office\u2014a compromise. But it\u2019s not nearly as freeing or balanced as its name would suggest; it's actually is just another office-centric plan that benefits bosses and leaves many employees in the lurch.\nSo says Annie Dean, the VP of Team Anywhere at Atlassian, a distributed work policy at the software firm that encourages asynchronous, flexible work wherever possible. Hybrid, Dean tells Fortune in an interview, isn\u2019t actually an even split between remote and in-office work, despite bosses who insist it\u2019s a huge step forward.\nDean, who got her start before the pandemic launching Werk, a startup that helped Fortune 500 companies establish flexible work arrangements, has been leading Team Anywhere at Atlassian for a year. Before that, she was \u201cDirector of Remote Work\u201d at Meta, then Facebook. Like its peers, Meta adopted a remote work policy early in the pandemic\u2014and hired Dean to execute on it. Now, like its peers, it\u2019s reversed course by mandating three days per week in the office in support of its \u201cyear of efficiency.\u201d\u00a0Zuckerberg said while Meta is \u201ccommitted to distributed work,\u201d he hopes employees \u201cfind more opportunities to work with your colleagues in person.\u201d\nDean is not tempted by the promises of greater efficiency, connection, and innovation that bosses at other tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, and Salesforce insist the office will bring. At Atlassian, any kind of in-office mandate is off the table.\n\u201cHybrid is an illusion of choice,\u201d Dean tells Fortune. Mandatory office attendance, which Dean calls \u201cthe crux\u201d of hybrid plans, is more sinister than it looks, and most workers don\u2019t acknowledge how central they are. By mandating any amount of time in the office, companies remove many potential benefits for the employee \u201cand much of the benefit for the company.\u201d\nMany bosses may disagree, pointing to sizable evidence that some workers\u2014especially new hires or young workforce entrants\u2014perform better when they can come to the office and learn by osmosis.\nIndeed, challenges in communicating remotely and finding motivation can hamstring fully remote workers\u2019 productivity. \u201cSupervising, training, mentoring, and building firm culture is much harder\u201d for them, Jose Maria Barrero, one of the leaders of WFH Research, told Fortune. Explaining or clarifying things over Zoom can take much longer, which in turn crowds out productive work time. And in the case of asynchronous teams working across the globe, forming connections is harder and rarer, which means time-sensitive, collaborative activities can take longer to carry out.\nRead more: Stop romanticizing in-office watercooler talk. As a fully distributed company of 12,000 people, here\u2019s what really works\nDean understands why so many companies have insisted on some days of in-person attendance, and she doesn\u2019t cast those aside. \u201cI don\u2019t think the desire to bring people back is just about power and control,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to imagine there are people in boardrooms looking at very expensive office leases. I have empathy for how they approach this. Boards are saying, \u2018you\u2019re wasting so much money, you have to bring people in.\u2019 And bosses don\u2019t have a good argument for why they shouldn't.\u201d\nBut remote still wins, at least for most workers, many of whom feel more productive working from home\u2014or at least having the choice to do so. Beyond just the lifestyle benefits (no commute, no sad desk lunch, no fancy office wardrobe) they actually get paid nearly 10% more. To Dean, being able to choose a city to live in\u2014especially these days, when rent and property values are astronomical\u2014is perhaps the primary perk of remote work. \u201cA lot of the advantage of Atlassian\u2019s model is that people can live near their family, in a place with lower cost of living. They can stay nearer to their home, and receive their kids off the bus.\u201d\nThe shift in quality of life when moving into an office-centric role is \u201cdeeply impactful for women in particular,\u201d Dean adds. (Women, on whom much of household and child care responsibilities disproportionately fall, prefer remote work in much greater numbers than men.) But fully flexible arrangements, like Team Anywhere, \u201cjust appear to be a healthier, happier way to live.\"\nOn the other hand, enforcing even just one day in-person per week \u201crequires people to organize their life around the office, and companies have to pay the highest cost of real estate,\u201d Dean says. \u201cIt means you\u2019re carrying all the costs of the old model, and can\u2019t have any efficiencies of the new model.\u201d\nOffice connectivity is often a misnomer, she adds. \u201cThe idea that office attendance will drive creativity is predicated on the idea that the right people are in the office at the right time,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if people are more than 30 feet away from you, it\u2019s like they\u2019re not in the same building.\u201d\nCompanies must let go of this orthodoxy and tolerate that not they haven\u2019t figured everything out yet, she continues. She cautions leaders against thinking issues like the endless remote work war are fundamentally unsolvable. \u201cIf we can\u2019t solve a problem of \u2018how we can get someone onboarded to a knowledge work company?', how will we ever solve climate change? This is just not that hard.\u201d\nPlus, she adds, the office is never going to be a solution to existing problems of productivity, innovation, or creativity. \u201cThose are all how to work problems, not where to work problems,\u201d she says. \u201cThe office won\u2019t solve these problems. New ways of working will. This is a watershed moment of innovation of how work gets done, but we\u2019re still talking about the f\u2013king watercooler.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n"

        "Author": "  Francesco Guarascio and Phuong Nguyen ",
        "Text": "By Francesco Guarascio and Phuong Nguyen\nHANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's president and ruling Communist Party chief To Lam is set to meet representatives from several U.S. corporations, including Google and Meta, during a visit to the United States next week, two people briefed about the plans told Reuters.\nMeta's Facebook has in the 100-million-people country one of its largest user bases worldwide, and Google makes its smartphones there through suppliers and plans a large data centre, according to a Reuters report last month.\nIn his first trip to the United States since he was named in early August as head of the party, the country's most powerful job, Lam is scheduled to meet representatives of Google and Meta, the two people said, with one noting each of the companies would have a separate meeting with him. Neither said what will be discussed.\nAnother two people familiar with the plans said Lam will also attend on Sept. 23 a business forum with other U.S. business representatives.\nAll the four sources declined to be identified because the information was not public.\nThe US-ASEAN Business Council (USABC), which is one of the organisers of the Sept. 23 event, declined to share a list of participants.\nGoogle and Facebook did not reply to requests for comment.\nIn two large U.S. business missions the USABC lobbying group organised in Vietnam over the last 18 months, it brought in dozens of top U.S. corporations including defence firms, energy and tech companies.\nAmong firms who attended both recent missions to Vietnam, are power company AES, aviation giant Boeing, payment company Mastercard and Amazon, including its cloud computing subsidiary Amazon Web Services, according to lists of participants seen by Reuters.\nU.S. companies see Vietnam as a manufacturing hub and a market for their products. Apple's suppliers complete many of the company's products there, Intel has a large chip assembling factory, and defence firms have been long in talks to sell security equipment to Hanoi.\nBIDEN MEETING?\nLam's trip to the United States has not been formally announced, but officials said he would travel there on Saturday to speak at the United Nations General Assembly where global leaders meet for their annual get-together on Sept 22-23. He will fly to Cuba later in the week in the final leg of his trip.\nColumbia University has announced an event with Lam on Sept. 23 in New York.\nThe U.S. and Vietnam boosted their diplomatic ties last year as Washington sees the Southeast Asian nation as a strategic partner to reduce reliance on Chinese manufacturing. The U.S. is also seeking closer ties with Hanoi on sensitive industries, including undersea cables.\nHowever, it is not clear whether Lam will meet U.S. President Joe Biden.\nA spokesperson for the White House declined to comment about Lam, but said Biden planned to meet several foreign leaders at the United Nations.\nVietnam's foreign ministry and the president office were not immediately available for comments.\nLam met Chinese President Xi Jinping last month in his first trip abroad after his appointment as party chief.\nHe also plans a state visit to France in early October, an official told Reuters.\n(Reporting by Francesco Guarascio and Phuong Nguyen in Hanoi; additional reporting by Jeff Mason and Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington; Editing by Kim Coghill)\n"

        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Google\u2019s technologies offer advertisers and publishers a safe ecosystem of tools to transact amid the intensely competitive world of online advertising, the company argued in federal court this week to counter Justice Department allegations that it is an illegal monopoly.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai\u2019s Sky-High Rents\nClimate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World\u2019s Megacities\nNew Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century\nVanderbilt Leases Struggling NYC Seminary for Campus Expansion\nNJ Transit, Amtrak Trains Delayed After Derailment Near NYC\nIn a federal antitrust trial, enforcers allege that Google has monopolized the technology used to buy and sell website ads, harming publishers and advertisers in the process.\nFor the past week in Alexandria, Virginia, the company laid out its defense, pointing to ways that close ties between its products help it fight spam and fraud, and ways that customers can easily switch to other providers. The trial wrapped up Friday. Judge Leonie Brinkema has scheduled closing arguments for Nov. 25 with an aim toward ruling before the end of the year.\n\u201cI think DOJ has the edge and a finding of liability is more likely than not,\u201d said Justin Teresi, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence who attended the trial.\nAlphabet Inc.\u2019s search giant argues it has no legal obligation to make its ad tech products work with those offered by competitors, and that on the internet, advertisers have many opportunities aside from purchasing website ads. Google competes fiercely against social networks, video streaming sites and other apps for ad dollars, its defense lawyers sought to show.\n\u201cGoogle is never going to tell this court that it is not a big company and that these investments and innovations have not been in its financial interest. They have been,\u201d Karen Dunn, Google\u2019s lead lawyer, said in opening statements. \u201cWe are one big company among many others intensely competing on a millisecond-by-millisecond basis for every single ad impression.\u201d\nCustomer choice\nBoth website publishers and advertisers have many options aside from Google\u2019s ad tech tools, the company said.\nIf a publisher doesn\u2019t want to use Google\u2019s tools \u201cthere are dozens, if not hundreds of pieces of tech they can use,\u201d said Scott Sheffer, Google\u2019s vice president for global partnerships. And there are \u201cmultiple ways to access\u201d ad demand from Google.\nIn lieu of using Google\u2019s ad server, which helps websites manage advertising inventory, they can build one in-house, as companies like Amazon.com Inc., Reddit Inc., Snap Inc. and Walt Disney Co. have done, said Mark Israel, Google\u2019s main economic expert. Small websites can use AdSense, which offers publishers ads from Google based on their content, said Sheffer. The company also offers AdX Direct, a product that connects to third-party ad servers like those offered by Microsoft Corp. or Equativ SAS.\nUnder questioning by the Justice Department, Sheffer acknowledged that AdSense or AdX Direct don\u2019t give the same access as if the publisher used Google\u2019s ad server since it is the only one that gets real-time price information.\nBut even for publishers using Google\u2019s ad server, there were ways to circumvent the tight connection to the company\u2019s ad exchange, said Nitish Korula, engineering director for ad serving and quality. Websites could instruct the ad server to prioritize a different ad exchange over Google\u2019s, he said. They could also boost bids by entering a higher number into the ad server than the actual bid they received to force Google\u2019s exchange to match it, he said.\nAfter questions from the DOJ, Korula acknowledged that few companies use the AdX Direct product. He wrote in 2020 that Google should keep it around because it might help the search giant as a \u201cconcept for antitrust.\u201d He also acknowledged that the \u201cboost\u201d feature had \u201csome downsides\u201d since it would interfere with a website\u2019s record-keeping.\nQuality control over ads\nGoogle, lawyers for the company said, had a legitimate business reason for tightly integrating products across its ad empire: doing so made it easier for its engineers to reduce ad spam and fraud, benefiting the entire advertising ecosystem.\nOpening up its tools to third-party rivals too quickly could make it easier for nefarious actors hoping to game the system and profit from advertising scams, the company argued. On the other hand, having more insight into the ads flowing across its systems allowed Google to catch con artists more quickly.\nPer Bjorke, a company product director for ad traffic quality, testified on Tuesday that Google was one of two primary companies that detected a multimillion-dollar ad fraud scheme called 3ve, leading to the shutdown of the operation and the prosecution of its leaders in 2018.\n\u201cThe vast majority of the 3ve traffic we received and bought came from the third-party ecosystem,\u201d Bjorke said. \u201cI believe that is primarily because we made it very hard for bad actors to infiltrate our AdSense and AdX networks.\u201d\nAlejandro Borgia, Google\u2019s director of product management for ad safety, testified that Google\u2019s end-to-end ad tech stack made it easier for the company to increase users\u2019 trust in ads. \u201cIf users feel unsafe, they won\u2019t click on ads or will turn on ad blockers,\u201d he said.\nIn response, the DOJ sought to show that there were other ways to fight spam and fraud besides tying together its ad products. Google, it argued, was not the only company that engaged in that work \u2014 and there were times the company wasn\u2019t particularly effective.\nMichael Freeman, a DOJ lawyer, asked Bjorke if he had heard of reports that found Google had facilitated the placement of ads on shady websites, including a 2022 ProPublica investigation that covered how Google\u2019s ad business funds disinformation around the world.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember that specific report,\u201d Bjorke said. \u201cI probably read it at the time, but I don\u2019t remember it right now.\u201d\nBorgia, Google\u2019s ad safety leader, acknowledged that in July 2021, the tech company only \u201cactively managed\u201d 10% of its safety policies, including only two related to scams. But Borgia said that didn\u2019t mean the company wasn\u2019t enforcing those policies, only that it didn\u2019t have dedicated models or teams focused on them. \u201cWe provide safety for those policies through other means,\u201d he said, such as machine learning algorithms.\nA wide open digital landscape\nThe government alleges that Google dominates the market for display ads shown on websites. But Google says that is just a slice of the digital advertising world today, where brands can connect with consumers on social media, in apps and on streaming video.\nIsrael, the Google economic expert, said advertisers can and do switch between different advertising formats, and the government should have considered advertising on apps, social media, video, and connected TV, which accounted for $140 billion spent in the US in 2022.\n\u201cFacebook, Amazon, TikTok are becoming the strongest players\u201d in digital advertising, he said, adding that Google views them as \u201cserious competitive threats,\u201d where advertisers are shifting their money as needed.\nBrian Bumpers, the marketing analytics manager for ecommerce site Zulily, said the company often shifts the $58 million it spends a year on advertising among different places. In 2016, Zulily spent $30 million on Google Ads, but dropped that to about $10 million the next year and increased its spending on Facebook\u2019s platforms to $30 million.\n\u2018No legal obligation\u2019 to help rivals\nGoogle argued that US law protects the company\u2019s right to choose whether to make its ad tech products work with others. Forcing Google to provide technology and resources to make its ad tech work seamlessly with rival tools would stifle innovation, the company\u2019s lawyer said.\nThe government is seeking to force Google to share its customers with competitors, said Dunn, Google\u2019s lead lawyer.\nWhen the government says \u201cthat rival exchanges need to have comparable access to Google Ads demand,\u201d she said, \u201cthat\u2019s our customer base.\u201d\nIsrael, the Google economic expert, said making Google provide rivals with the same access to its tools would harm competition and amount to \u201cforced interoperability.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s ad exchange AdX was built before real-time bidding was developed, said Korula, the engineering director. \u201cIt would take years to rebuild\u201d Google\u2019s exchange to allow that functionality, he said.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t prevent other exchanges from submitting real-time bids\u201d into the ad server, Korula said. No company ever offered to undertake the technical work and expense to make their exchanges work with Google\u2019s products, he said.\nThe Justice Department argued that Google has already undertaken much of the technological work that needs to happen to make its products operate seamlessly with rivals.\nIn 2019, it started a project internally code-named Project Yavin to connect its exchange to the in-house ad servers operated by Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn and eBay Inc. It has also already let its ad network, Google Ads, bid on certain types of ads in other exchanges and could expand that feature more broadly.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nApple Rolls Back Its Big Plans to Release Movies in Theaters\nSports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought\nThe End of the Cheap Burger\nInside Activision and Blizzard\u2019s Corporate Warcraft\nThis Camera Went Viral Two Years Ago.

        "Author": "  Ethan Feller ",
        "Text": "Action over the last three months in the stock market has been marked by a notable shift in leaders from Tech and AI to more defensive sectors like Utilities, Healthcare, Real Estate and Bonds. In the chart below we can see that since June, the Real Estate ETF\u00a0XLRE, Treasury ETF\u00a0TLT, Utilities ETF\u00a0XLU\u00a0and Healthcare\u00a0XLV\u00a0have outperformed both\u00a0SPY\u00a0and\u00a0QQQ\u00a0by a fairly significant margin.\nAs the Federal Reserve signals the start of a rate-cutting regime and broad economic indicators (employment, growth, inflation) point to a slowdown (not a recession), it's not surprising that some investors have shifted to more conservative holdings.\nHowever, now that tech stocks have been out of favor for nearly three months, many of the leading names, such as the Magnificent Seven stocks have traded to quite attractive levels. In this article, I\u2019ll highlight my top three picks moving forward\u2014Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Nvidia (NVDA)\u2014along with key tactical trading levels to watch.\nImage Source: TradingView\nApple: New iPhone and AI Innovations\nOn Monday, Apple unveiled a new lineup of products, including the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Key features of the iPhone 16 series include enhanced camera capabilities, improved battery life, a new Action button for quick shortcuts and its new AI system called Apple Intelligence. \u00a0\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 boasts upgraded health tracking features and a redesigned case. AirPods 4 offer improved audio quality, active noise cancellation, and enhanced hearing health features. \u00a0\nApple has expanded its foray into health monitoring, with the AirPods now administering hearing tests and functioning as a 'clinical-grade' hearing aid. Additionally, the Apple Watch will now be able to monitor for sleep apnea by tracking breathing disturbances. \u00a0\nAlthough critics often note the seemingly incremental improvements to these new Apple products, I find the health-monitoring functionalities especially compelling, while the new AI features could significantly improve usability.\nApple stock has notably outperformed all of the Magnificent Seven stocks since May of this year, which is especially impressive considering the high volatility the market has experienced over the last three months.\nImage Source: TradingView\nAlong with the relative strength of Apple stock, a more granular look at the price action shows a potential bull flag forming. If the broad market can hold up and AAPL breaks out above the $220 level, it should make an attempt at new all-time highs.\nFurthermore, the material integration of AI into the iPhone, the most widely used mobile device in the world sets up Apple to possibly ascend to AI leadership. At the least, if the AI narrative picks up again, Apple should be at the forefront.\nImage Source: TradingView\nMeta Platforms: A Well Rounded and Promising Stock Pick\nAlthough Meta Platforms seems to semi-regularly get caught up in frenzied controversy such as political scandals and misguided investments (Metaverse) the business continues to grow like crazy and spew profits. These manic cycles, although sometimes exhausting, have created numerous opportunities for savvy investors to pick up shares at a discount.\nSales are expected to grow 19.8% this year and 13.9% next year, while earnings are projected to jump 43.6% this year and 12.7% next year. Analysts forecast earnings per share (EPS) to grow 19% annually over the next three to five years. Additionally, the stock is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 23.6x, which is inline with the market average and below its 10-year median valuation of 25x.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeta Platforms isn\u2019t currently mixed up in any scandals and has rather been the second-best performing stock in the Magnificent Seven since the start of 2023, bested only by Nvidia. But even with this incredible stock price appreciation, META remains among the cheapest of the group when comparing relative valuations thanks to equally impressive growth in EPS.\nImage Source: TradingView\nThe price action in Meta Platforms\u2019 stock also paints a bullish picture. In addition to relative strength, META is building out a bull flag, nest within a broader consolidation. If the stock can break out above the $515 level, it should move into the upper range and beyond. Alternatively, if the stock loses the lower bound support of ~$465, the broader market is likely selling off, and it may be prudent to wait for another opportunity.\nImage Source: TradingView\nNvidia: Cheapest Relative Valuation in Years\nNvidia, the most exciting stock in the market over the last two years, has been struggling over the last three months. Between mid-June and early-August Nvidia staged a nasty correction, falling 35%. After rallying aggressively from the lows and testing the upper bound of the range, the shares have again sold off.\nHovering now just above $100, I think investors have an opportunity to buy the stock near the bottom of the range. And not only has the stock come down to more reasonable levels, so has the Semiconductor manufacturer\u2019s valuation.\nImage Source: TradingView\nToday, Nvidia is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 38x, which is below its 10-year media of 42.8x and close to the lowest it has been in the last five years. With EPS forecast to grow 41.7% annually over the next three to five years, Nvidia has a PEG ratio of 0.9, which is a discount based on the metric.\nIf we look a little further into the future, Nvidia is trading at just 28x FY26 earnings. If growth remains as high as projected, Nvidia stock should continue to appreciate strongly.\nShould Investors Buy Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Apple Stock?\nGiven the current market conditions, a shift towards defensive sectors has created attractive buying opportunities among the tech leaders, particularly the Magnificent Seven. Stocks like Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) have all experienced pullbacks in recent months, presenting investors with entry points at more reasonable valuations.\nApple, with its latest product releases and AI innovations, continues to show resilience and leadership, while Meta Platforms, despite past controversies, is experiencing tremendous growth and remains undervalued compared to its peers. Nvidia, despite its recent correction, offers high growth potential and is trading at its most attractive valuation in years.\nFor long-term investors, these stocks offer a blend of stability, innovation, and growth. Apple\u2019s steady outperformance, Meta\u2019s explosive earnings growth, and Nvidia\u2019s dominance in AI and semiconductor technology make these three companies well-positioned for the next market uptrend. With their recent pullbacks, now may be the time to capitalize on their future potential before the market shifts back in favor of tech.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For this type of content, Meta is moving the \u201cAI info\u201d label to the post\u2019s menu. In the past, the label would appear directly under the user\u2019s name.\nThe company says the label will still appear under content that it has detected was generated by an AI tool.

        "Author": " Daniel Howley    \u00b7 Technology Editor",
        "Text": "Meta (META) is rolling out a new, less expensive version of its pricey Meta Quest 3 mixed-reality headset. Unveiled during the company's annual Meta Connect event, the Meta Quest 3S offers the same functionality as the Meta Quest 3 with a starting price of $299. Meta is also dropping the price of the Quest 3 from a whopping $649 to $499.\nThe Quest 3S sports the same full-color mixed-reality capabilities as the Quest 3, albeit with a narrower field of view and a different overall design. Meta says the Quest 3S also runs on the same Qualcomm (QCOM) Snapdragon XR2 gen. 2 chip found in the Quest 3.\nAs the company rolls out the Quest 3S, it's also doing away with its older Quest 2 and pricier Quest Pro headsets.\nMeta is positioning the Quest 3S as its entry-level headset for consumers who are just getting into mixed-reality apps and those looking to upgrade from older Quest models. The Quest 3, then, is geared toward consumers who are already mixed-reality fans and are willing to shell out the cash for Meta's top-of-the-line features.\nMeta says the Quest 3S is compatible with the company's entire library of apps and games and will support upcoming titles like \"Batman: Arkham Shadow.\"\nMeta, however, isn't the only name in the headset business. Apple (AAPL) also sells its Vision Pro mixed-reality device, though, at $3,499, it's far more expensive than Meta's offerings. Apple hasn't provided insights into the device's sales performance.\nMixed-reality headset sales have faced a tough road as of late. According to IDC, worldwide shipments of augmented and virtual reality headsets fell as much as 28% year over year in the second quarter to 1.1 million units.\n\"In recent quarters, mixed reality (MR) headsets took a leap forward in fidelity, first with the launch of the Quest 3 and later the Vision Pro,\" Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, wrote in a release.\n\"However, the lack of affordable options has meant that few consumers have experienced this new technology.\"\nBut the Meta Quest 3S could start to turn the tide thanks to its relatively low price point. IDC said headset shipments are expected to increase from 6.7 million units in 2024 to 22.9 million in 2028.\nWhile that's a solid improvement for the headset business, it's still a far cry from the hundreds of millions of smartphones sold each year. Headsets also have to contend with strong competition from the gaming industry, including from console makers like Nintendo (NTDOY), which is expected to launch its next-generation console in 2025, and Sony (SONY), which is preparing to ship a high-powered version of its PlayStation 5 this fall.\nMeta is also struggling to make a profit from its vast augmented reality investments. The company recorded a $16 billion loss in the segment for 2023, up from $13.7 billion in 2022, and expects that to increase in 2024.\nStill, as the leader in the mixed-reality space, Meta could be the company to truly push the industry forward.

        "Author": "  Kurt Wagner and Aisha Counts ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. debuted its first pair of augmented reality glasses \u2014 devices that show a combined view of the digital and physical worlds, a key step in Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s goal of one day offering a hands-free alternative to the smartphone.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai\u2019s Sky-High Rents\nGang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon\u2019s Fast-Growing Cities\nA Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda\u2019s Capital City\nNew Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century\nClimate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World\u2019s Megacities\nThe new glasses, introduced Wednesday and called Orion, look like thick, black reading glasses, but have lenses that can display text messages, video calls, and even YouTube videos onto the user\u2019s field of vision. They are prototypes that aren\u2019t for sale, but will be used internally at Meta for testing and improving the product.\nAn accompanying wristband that detects nerve stimulation and cameras built into the frames that track eye movement allow Orion wearers to \u201cclick\u201d or \u201cscroll\u201d on the display using just their hands.\nMeta\u2019s Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth said he expects the glasses will become a consumer product within the next decade, adding that the next two models are in the works.\nThe company wants to price the glasses so \u201cnot just consumers use it, but developers want to build for it,\u201d Bosworth said Wednesday in an interview on Bloomberg Television.\nThe glasses represent nearly a decade of technological advancement and significant financial investment at Meta. They also offer a glimpse into Zuckerberg\u2019s vision for the future of technology, which has cost the company tens of billions of dollars over the past four years alone.\nMeta is already selling Ray-Ban branded smart glasses equipped with cameras and speakers, but Zuckerberg believes that AR glasses will become a kind of mobile, hands-free computer that could one day rival smartphones as the preferred way to communicate and interact online. If smart glasses eventually become mainstream, Meta hopes to be a major player in that new industry, which would also help the company reduce its reliance on competitors like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google to deliver its products to consumers.\n\u201cThese things happen slowly and then kind of all at once,\u201d Bosworth said in the Bloomberg TV interview. \u201cWhen you can replace an existing use case, people can switch very quickly. Things like using augmented reality glasses to replace your phone, that\u2019s going to take a lot longer.\u201d\nThat goal is still years away despite the Orion prototype, which debuted at Meta\u2019s annual Connect conference in Menlo Park, California. The company had hoped to make this version of the device available to the public, but executives said it\u2019s not yet small enough or stylish enough. Those same challenges have plagued similar efforts by other tech companies over the years, including Google and Microsoft Corp.\nSnap Inc. unveiled its own pair of AR glasses earlier this month, but is only releasing them to developers.\nEventually, Meta executives believe they will be able to make the glasses thin and powerful enough that general consumers will buy them. The goal is to bring Orion to market in the \u201cnext few years\u201d for the price of a \u201chigh end laptop or smartphone,\u201d said Rahul Prasad, a senior director of product management at Meta.\n\u201cAny kind of prior attempt at AR has been a headset, goggles, helmets,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to get to glasses.\u201d\nFor now, Meta will continue to build and refine the glasses internally until they are ready for public sale. Hundreds of Meta employees have been testing the Orion glasses. The company plans to expand that group considerably now that they\u2019ve been debuted publicly.\nUnlike competing products, such as Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, Meta\u2019s Orion glasses don\u2019t require a bulky head strap or battery pack to operate. Orion has seven cameras, including two for tracking eye movements, which allow users to control the display using visible hand gestures. Orion works best, though, when paired with an accompanying wristband, which uses electromyography to detect much more subtle hand movements so users can control the glasses with minor finger movements.\nMeta designed and produced more than 10 different computer chips embedded in Orion, part of a plan to reduce energy consumption for the glasses but also to decrease the amount of heat generated so that they aren\u2019t warm to the touch. Instead of glass, Orion\u2019s lenses are made of silicon carbide, a material popular in some electric vehicles, which is lighter than glass and also helps bend light at extreme angles, Prasad said.\nWhile using silicon carbide is a major breakthrough for Meta, Bosworth said the company is already looking for a cheaper alternative that could provide the same functionality at a lower price.\nNew Quest VR Headset\nMeta also announced a new, cheaper version of its Quest virtual reality headset, freshening its effort to persuade consumers to spend more time using virtual and augmented reality to play games, watch videos and chat with others.\nThe Quest 3S headset has much of the same functionality as the existing Quest 3 device but offers less memory and is several hundred dollars cheaper. The headset will be available in stores beginning Oct. 15 and will cost as little as $300, compared to the $500 Quest 3 devices.\n--With assistance from Alicia Clanton and Ed Ludlow.\n(Updates with comments from Meta CTO beginning in the third paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Great \u20ac3 Billion Shipping Container Heist\nInvestors Hot on India Shrug Off Adani Short Seller Attack\nMilitary Veterans Help Plug Worker Shortages at EV, Battery Plants Sprouting Up in the US\nSports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought\nThe Presidential Election Isn\u2019t Stopping International Students From Coming to America\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Meta Connect 2024 is a developer-centric event featuring a keynote from CEO Mark Zuckerberg. He showcased new hardware and software to support two of Meta\u2019s big ambitions: AI and the metaverse. This included everything from new Quest headsets, updates to Meta\u2019s Llama AI model, and even a new fully AR glasses prototype.\nMeta Connect 2024 kicked off live at 10 a.m. PT Wednesday, September 25. You can watch the archive via Meta Connect\u2019s site, on Meta\u2019s developer Facebook page, and you can still dive into Horizon Worlds from your Meta Quest headset if you really want to feel the full immersion.\nWe\u2019ll be compiling all of the announcements and reveals out of Meta Connect 2024 below and will keep it updated throughout the event and after as more reactions and analysis arrive.\nIn a surprise announcement, Zuckerberg dramatically revealed Orion, which Meta says will eventually become the company's \"first consumer full holographic AR glasses,\" though they won't be arriving on any consumers' faces anytime soon. Touting Orion's light weight, compatibility for hand-tracking and eye-tracking, and most ambitiously, a neural interface, Zuckerberg also touted some impressed, and famous, early testers (including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang). The Orion glasses were presented as the future of Meta's AR efforts, with our own ongoing coverage of Meta Connect's final big reveal here.\nMeta's reveal of the Quest 3S was indicated by several pre-event leaks and confirmed during Connect 2024. The Meta Quest 3S comes as a less expensive alternative to the Quest 3, starting at $299 for a 128GB version and 256GB for $399. The entirely wireless headset is compatible with the existing library of Quest apps and games, though Meta was particularly enthusiastic about its mixed-reality features. With the reveal of the Quest 3S, the Quest 3 will drop from $649 to $499. Get our early impressions of the new Quest 3S here ahead of its October 15 ship date.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1838992643319021592\n\"With Quest 3S on the shelf, we\u2019re officially winding down sales of Quest 2 and Pro. We\u2019ll be selling our remaining headsets through the end of the year or until they\u2019re gone, whichever comes first,\" Meta told TechCrunch about the discontinuation of two of their headsets in the wake of the Quest 3S announcement.\nMeta AI is finding its voice. Users can ask a question or otherwise chat with Meta AI out loud through Messenger, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram and get simulated vocal responses in return. The digital voice assistant will roll out with multiple voice options to choose from, including the AI voices of celebrities like Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Awkwafina, Kristen Bell, and Keegan-Michael Key.\nThe reveal comes a day after OpenAI announced the long-awaited rollout of its Advanced Voice Mode feature, with a new look and five new voices. And speaking of vocal announcements, Zuckerberg touted that Meta AI now has 500 million users.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1838999866724262105\nMeta\u2019s multilingual Llama family of models has reached version 3.2, signifying that several Llama models are now multimodal. Llama 3.2 11B and 90B can interpret charts and graphs, caption images, and pinpoint objects in pictures given a simple description.\nLlama 3.2 11B and 90B might be able to look at a map of a park and tell you how long a certain path is, or when the terrain could become steeper. Or, provided a graph showing a company\u2019s revenue over the course of a year, the models can quickly spotlight the best-performing months of the bunch.\nNotably, Llama 3.2 11B and 90B can\u2019t be accessed in Europe due to the EU\u2019s Act restrictions. As a result, several Meta AI features available elsewhere, like image analysis, are disabled for European users.\nRay-Ban\u2019s Meta smart glasses are getting upgrades as the company continues to try and make the case that the smart glasses can become the next big consumer device. At the forefront of the pitch is the addition of real-time AI video processing, which lets you to ask the Ray-Ban Meta glasses questions about what it can see in front of you.\nThe sunglasses will also be getting a smartphone-like reminder feature; live language translation between English and French, Italian, or Spanish; and full integration with music streaming apps like Amazon Music, Audible, and iHeart Radio.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1839038482968203550\nZuckerberg's evolution into a self-made fashionista was on full display during Meta Connect, with a shirt that spelled out: \"Act Zuck aut nihil,\" which for those not well versed in Latin, translates to \"either Zuck or nothing.\" The phrase is originally associated with Roman Emperor Julius Caesar, further cementing Zuckerberg as a Rome Guy.\nIn a feature that will be familiar to anyone following OpenAI, Google, and Apple's application of image-based searches, Meta showcased its AI's capacity to respond to prompts based on images, as well as edit photos provided to the AI based on feedback given by the user. It can also share them to Instagram Stories.\nIf you're on Facebook, you've probably seen a lot of AI recently, knowingly or unknowingly. There's an entire nascent industry around using it to generate engagement bait. Earlier this month, the label noting whether content has been edited using Meta's tools was shrunk down. And now Facebook will actually pitch you on AI content that it generates for you that it thinks you'll want to share or engage with.\nGoing a step beyond just translating captions, Meta announced a test that would use its AI translation tools to take creator content, create a translated dub, and sync the creator's lips accordingly. So far, the experiment is limited to creator videos made in the U.S. and Latin America, with translations between English and Spanish.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1839025828371308855\nIn what ended up being a surreal moment, Zuckerberg brought on creator Don Allen Stevenson III for a conversation on the stage, which then turned into a demo during which Zuckerberg interviewed an AI version of Stevenson while the real deal was right beside him.\nAmid the big AI reveals and hardware and announcements, Meta did dive into the broader purpose of Connect \u2014 building ties with its community of developers. As it continues to pitch developers on helping build out the Quest app store's offerings, Meta released new support for Android apps on the Quest, along with support for 3D and spatial apps.\nA number of new experiences were revealed for the Quest ecosystem at Meta Connect 2024, led by Batman: Arkham Shadow, which launches October 22 and will also be bundled with new Quest 3 and 3S purchases until April of next year. Beyond games with familiar concepts like Alien: Rogue Incursion for Xenomorph-filled horror and a remake of the zombie game Arizona Sunshine, Wordle of all things was announced for the Quest. The VR version of the daily puzzle will be free to play without a New York Times subscription.\nhttps://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/1839008631263535499\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/26/meta-connect-2024-orion-glasses-quest-3s-headset-meta-ai-upgrades-ray-ban-meta-real-time-video-and-more-revealed/\n"

        "Text": "Mark Zuckerberg, the founder behind Meta (previously Facebook), leaped into the ranks of the world's fourth-richest person with a net worth of $201 billion. His spectacular rise comes after the strategic shift of Meta into metaverse hardware and artificial intelligence from October 2021.\nMeta's stock is making a roaring comeback, trading at around $567 per share, a massive six-fold hike from its November 2022 price of about $88. It has made this dramatic turn in fortune after investors had been initially skeptical of the ambitious foray into developing augmented reality and AI that the company embarked on.\nThe financial rise by Zuckerberg now places him in the company of Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault, according to Bloomberg's latest wealth ranking. Half of the world's top 10 most valuable companies, including tech giants Apple, Google, Nvidia, and Microsoft, are now developing their own metaverse hardware.\nDuring a recent Meta Connect event in California, Zuckerberg unveiled two of the company's latest creations: Orion augmented reality glasses and the more affordable Quest 3S VR headset. These Orion glasses boast advanced projectors that can beam a virtual heads-up display onto the real world, a new direction that Meta is taking in its commitment to immersive technology.\nDespite high-flying stocks, the company imposed a 20% budget cut on its metaverse division, Reality Labs, and asked for a 20% reduction in departmental expenses by 2026. In fact, Reality Labs was among the most expensive Meta projects, having lost some $60 billion since 2019 and continuing to remain in loss during the second quarter of 2024.\nZuckerberg has made clear that Meta intends to scale its AI business by narrowing the focus of the company and putting more capital investment into AI research. \"We've released the first frontier-level open-source AI model, and we continue to see good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses,\" Zuckerberg said on the recent earnings call.\n"

Meta says the Quest 3S also runs on the same Qualcomm (QCOM) Snapdragon XR2 gen. 2 chip found in the Quest 3.\nAs the company rolls out the Quest 3S, it's also doing away with its older Quest 2 and pricier Quest Pro headsets.\nMeta is positioning the Quest 3S as its entry-level headset for consumers who are just getting into mixed-reality apps and those looking to upgrade from older Quest models. The Quest 3, then, is geared toward consumers who are already mixed-reality fans and are willing to shell out the cash for Meta's top-of-the-line features.\nMeta says the Quest 3S is compatible with the company's entire library of apps and games and will support upcoming titles like \"Batman: Arkham Shadow.\"\nMeta, however, isn't the only name in the headset business. Apple (AAPL) also sells its Vision Pro mixed-reality device, though, at $3,499, it's far more expensive than Meta's offerings. Apple hasn't provided insights into the device's sales performance.\nMixed-reality headset sales have faced a tough road as of late. According to IDC, worldwide shipments of augmented and virtual reality headsets fell as much as 28% year over year in the second quarter to 1.1 million units.\n\"In recent quarters, mixed reality (MR) headsets took a leap forward in fidelity, first with the launch of the Quest 3 and later the Vision Pro,\" Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, wrote in a release.\n\"However, the lack of affordable options has meant that few consumers have experienced this new technology.\"\nBut the Meta Quest 3S could start to turn the tide thanks to its relatively low price point. IDC said headset shipments are expected to increase from 6.7 million units in 2024 to 22.9 million in 2028.\nWhile that's a solid improvement for the headset business, it's still a far cry from the hundreds of millions of smartphones sold each year. Headsets also have to contend with strong competition from the gaming industry, including from console makers like Nintendo (NTDOY), which is expected to launch its next-generation console in 2025, and Sony (SONY), which is preparing to ship a high-powered version of its PlayStation 5 this fall.\nMeta is also struggling to make a profit from its vast augmented reality investments. The company recorded a $16 billion loss in the segment for 2023, up from $13.7 billion in 2022, and expects that to increase in 2024.\nStill, as the leader in the mixed-reality space, Meta could be the company to truly push the industry forward.

        "Text": "By Jonathan Stempel\n(Reuters) - Meta Platforms won the dismissal of a lawsuit claiming it defrauded shareholders by concealing how changes to Apple's privacy settings would make Facebook and Instagram less desirable for advertisers.\nIn a decision on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also rejected claims that Meta concealed former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg's use of company resources on personal matters, including her wedding and her best-selling book \"Lean In.\"\nThe Oakland, California-based judge also turned aside claims that Meta knew its transition to Reels, which copied TikTok's short-form video format, would hurt revenue because it offered fewer ads per hour than older formats.\nShareholders led by four Israeli insurers and pension funds challenged 17 allegedly false and misleading statements that Meta made in 2021 and 2022.\nThey said Meta's stock price fell 53% in less than a year as the truth came out, wiping out well over $500 billion of the Menlo Park, California-based company's market value.\nBut in her 34-page decision, Rogers said Meta's eventual admission that Apple's iOS privacy changes could pose a $10 billion \"headwind\" in 2022 did not demonstrate that its earlier disclosures were false.\nShe also said the claims about Sandberg came \"entirely from press reports\" and were unproven, and found no proof that the transition to Reels hurt Meta's financial performance.\n\"The court determines plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged violations of federal securities law,\" Rogers wrote.\nShe dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again.\nOther defendants included Sandberg, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, Chief Financial Officer Susan Li and her predecessor David Wehner.\nLawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Meta had no immediate comment.\nThe case, which has a different named plaintiff, is Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v Meta Platforms Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-01470.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n"

        "Text": "By Ammu Kannampilly and Humphrey Malalo\nNAIROBI (Reuters) -A Kenyan court ruled on Friday that Facebook's parent company Meta could be sued in the East African nation over the dismissal of dozens of content moderators by a contractor.\nLast year the content moderators sued Meta and two contractors, saying they lost their jobs with Sama, a Kenya-based firm contracted to moderate Facebook content, for trying to organise a union.\nThey said they were then blacklisted from applying for the same roles at another firm, Majorel, after Facebook changed contractors.\nOut-of-court settlement talks between the moderators and Meta collapsed in October last year.\nThe case could have implications for how Meta works with content moderators globally. The U.S. giant works with moderators around the world tasked with reviewing graphic content posted on its platform.\nFriday's decision by the Court of Appeal upheld an earlier ruling by a Kenyan labour court in April 2023 that Meta could face trial over the moderators' dismissals, which Meta appealed.\nIt also upheld a separate ruling in February 2023 that Meta could be sued in Kenya over alleged poor working conditions, which Meta also appealed.\n\"The upshot of our above findings is that the appellants' (Meta's) appeals ... are devoid of merit and both appeals are hereby dismissed with costs to the respondents,\" the judges at the Court of Appeal said in their ruling.\nMeta and Majorel did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Sama said it was reviewing the decision and would provide a statement soon.\nMeta has previously responded to allegations of a poor working environment in Kenya by saying it requires partners to provide industry-leading conditions.\nMajorel has said it does not comment on pending or active litigation.\n\"Meta being sued in Kenya is a wake-up call for all Big Tech companies to pay attention to the human rights violations taking place along their value chains,\" said Mercy Mutemi, a lawyer for the content moderators.\nFoxglove, a British tech rights group supporting the moderators' case, said Meta had run out of road.\n\"We are excited the roadblocks are finally gone \u2013 and will support the 185 (contractors) every step of the road to the courtroom,\u201d Foxglove director Martha Dark said.\n(Reporting by Ammu Kannampilly and Humphrey Malalo; Writing by Hereward Holland; Editing by Alexander Winning and Aurora Ellis)\n"

Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity,\u201d a Meta (META) spokesperson said in a statement.\nPrior to Monday\u2019s ban, RT had 7.2 million followers on Facebook and 1 million followers on Instagram.\nRT did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.\nThe move comes days after the US Justice Department announced charges against two RT employees for funneling nearly $10 million into a US company, identified by CNN as Tenet Media, to create and amplify content that aligned with Russian interests. The covert influence campaign was aimed at the American public ahead of the 2024 US presidential election, US officials said.\nTenet Media boasts a slate of high-profile right-wing, pro-Trump commentators including Tim Pool, Dave Rubin, Benny Johnson and several others. All of them have released statements saying they were victims of the alleged Russian scheme.\nAfter the Justice Department announcement, RT responded with mocking statements that did not address the specifics of the US allegations.\nThe Kremlin commented on the ban by Meta on Tuesday. \u201cWith these actions, Meta is discrediting itself\u2026 This complicates the prospects for normalizing our relations with Meta,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nThe Justice Department indictment was just one piece of the recent US government crackdown on RT and other Russian state mouthpieces. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday accused RT\u2019s leaders of running an online crowdfunding effort to supply military equipment to Russian soldiers in Ukraine.\nMeta\u2019s ban on RT comes after years of a cat-and-mouse game between the American social media giant and Russian state actors.

The deadline had been set for the end of the month, and Chhabria said he would extended it by 14 days to account for a few remaining depositions.\nMeta\u2019s Internal Documents\nThe authors first filed the class action against Meta in the US District Court for the Northern District of California last year, alleging the company took their copyrighted books without permission to train its open source AI model called LLaMA.

They also argued that Meta has produced tens of thousands of technical documents that the plaintiffs\u2019 experts must analyze.\nBut Chhabria said the discovery process had been dragging on for too long, based largely on failures by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys to raise discovery disputes in a timely manner.\nThe judge said he was in a \u201cbind\u201d because on the one hand, the discovery problems are the fault of the plaintiffs. But on the other hand, the question of copyright law and AI training is an \u201cimportant societal issue\u201d and the court has a duty to the proposed class members, Chhabria said.\nCooley LLP, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, and Lex Lumina PLLC represents Meta.\nThe case is Kadrey v.

        "Title": "Meta's Orion Smart Glasses Could Be Revolutionary: Is the $2 Trillion Club in its Future?",
        "Author": "  Billy Duberstein, The Motley Fool ",
        "Text": "The stock of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has been on fire this year, but not because of its Metaverse efforts, as the companies' new name implies. Rather, Meta's core social media ad business has recovered nicely from the 2022 slump, helped along by smarter artificial intelligence algorithms. Speaking of AI, Meta's open-source Llama large language models (LLMs) have also made headlines this year. In turn, Meta is now regarded as a major AI player.\nWith so much going on in AI, investors seem to be looking past its Metaverse segment. That may seem odd, as the company once known as Facebook changed its name to Meta in 2021. With the company's Reality Labs segment continuing to lose billions of dollars every quarter, investors may have written off the effort.\nBut last week, Meta unveiled Orion. While still in prototype, this augmented reality (AR) glasses product has the potential to be a real game-changer, finally, for Reality Labs and Meta at large.\nAt its Connect 24 developer conference last week, Meta unveiled Orion, a new AR headset that look and feel like regular, transparent glasses. Orion is actually big step forward over Meta's previous offerings. Meta's Quest VR goggles don't look like regular glasses and aren't transparent. Meanwhile, last year's unveiling of Ray-Ban smart glasses did have transparent lenses while offering photo and video-taking capabilities, but lacked comprehensive computing capabilities found on smartphones.\nOrion offers a glasses-like look and feel similar to the Ray-Ban glasses, but with advanced holographic AR capabilities that project right onto the lenses. So the glasses offer smart AI computing, but the wearer can still see through the lenses to their immediate surroundings.\nMeta AI is also embedded in the glasses' technology, enabling more use cases. For instance, the company gave an example of someone looking into their refrigerator, then asking Meta AI to come up with a recipe based on what foods were viewed through Orion.\nThis seems like Meta's first real device consumers may wear around in their regular lives, potentially replacing some smartphone use cases.\nThe reason Meta is spending so much of the Metaverse is that it wishes to own the next ubiquitous computing platform. Currently, Meta must run its apps on competitors' devices, most notably Android and iOS smartphones.\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg estimates this arrangement costs Meta billions of dollars in lost revenue every year. In the past, he cited Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) as costing Meta roughly $10 billion in revenue in 2022, after Apple unveiled more stringent privacy measures around data collection on iPhones. While Meta has done an impressive job using AI to enhance its engagement and ad targeting despite those data restrictions, in a more recent interview, Zuckerberg said Meta's internal studies still conclude Meta would still be \"way more\" profitable without Apple's restrictions.\nMeta's Reality Labs segment is currently running at a stunning $18 billion loss-rate this year, and investors have a hard time figuring out how Meta will eventually get a return on all that spending.\nWhile improved devices such as Orion should lead to more hardware sales, that's not the only reason or maybe even the main reason Meta is doing this. Disintermediating Apple and Android could unlock billions in high-profit revenue, just from running Meta's Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp properties natively on its own platform.\nFurthermore, Meta's hardware efforts could yield interesting breakthroughs when combined with its work in AI. After last week's event, Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett raised his price target on Meta shares from $643 to $811. While his note was mostly geared toward how AI benefits the core advertising platforms, he came away impressed with the new hardware too, which, in his words, showed Meta is, \"uniquely delivering category products that could be described as leading in consumer adoption.\"\nIt should be noted that the Orion glasses are still in prototype, and currently in testing with internal Meta employees and a select group of developers.\nStill, if Orion eventually makes its way onto shelves in the next year or two, it could finally be a needle-moving moment for Meta's Reality Labs segment. The glasses are the results of \"dozens of innovations\" around miniaturization and packaging components down to mere millimeters apart, according to Meta.\nThat sounds hard to do, and with Meta spending so much money on this effort, Orion may be difficult for other companies to match, even those as large as the Magnificent Seven.\nTrading at just 23.5 times next year's earnings estimates, even when discounting tens of billions in Metaverse losses, and Meta stock still looks very buyable here -- especially as its hardware division may finally be showing some long-awaited breakthroughs.\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Meta Platforms wasn\u2019t one of them.

        "Author": "  GlobalData Technology ",
        "Text": "Meta announced the new $299 Meta Quest 3S mixed reality headset at its Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California.\nThe Quest 3S comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 processor, 8 GB of RAM, two RGB cameras for colour passthrough, four VGA cameras for hand and controlling tracking, and 2.5 hours of battery use. The 3S comes in two storage models: the 128GB at $299.99 and the 256GB at $399.99.\nMeta's Quest 3S mixed reality headset represents an updated version of Quest 3, offered at a 40% reduction in price. This device retains the same features as its costlier counterpart but is available for $200 less, thereby positioning mixed reality within the mainstream market's grasp. Meta has assumed the role of democratising mixed reality technology. The \u201cS\u201d in 3S stands for \u201cStart,\u201d clearly targeting users new to VR.\nHowever, Meta's strategy of heavily subsidising its hardware is not viable in the long term. The company's Reality Labs division is experiencing significant financial losses due to hardware research and development, funding exclusive titles from studios, and underwriting the costs of its headsets.\nShould Meta reduce its support for VR, the industry could face dire consequences. The market has already seen a slowdown in the release of high-budget games, and recent major titles have underperformed, leading developers to retreat from VR projects. The industry's current state falls short of what many had envisioned a few years ago and is facing a contraction in market size.\nSince its acquisition of Oculus in 2014, Meta has invested more than $65bn in its hardware initiatives. VR developers harboured optimism that Apple's foray into the market would catalyse a surge in new applications and user engagement.\nNevertheless, Apple has not disclosed sales figures for its headset, and reports indicate modest sales volumes, with fewer than 1 million units sold. Apple has found itself at a disadvantage in the AI competition, as Google has aggressively introduced its Gemini AI into Android devices, challenging Apple on its home turf.\nIn response, Apple is dedicating substantial time and resources to enhance its Apple Intelligence, a move that may impact the development of its Vision Pro headset and the VR industry.\nMeta\u2019s rationale for the substantial investment in VR and AR stems from Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s conviction that these technologies will culminate in the creation of sleek, transparent glasses.\nThe current focus on developing VR software and hardware represents preliminary measures toward achieving this vision, a concept of which was showcased at Meta Connect called Orion, thick black-framed AR glasses to be used internally at Meta for further development. However, the fruition of such glasses may require a development timeline extending up to a decade.\n\"Meta Quest 3S \u2013 A $299 VR headset?

        "Text": "Meta AI is starting to catch up with Google when it comes to AI-powered photo editing. On Wednesday, at the Meta Connect 2024 conference, the tech giant announced that Meta AI will now be able to help you edit photos using AI technology and answer questions about the photos you share.\nThe additional features are made possible because Meta AI is gaining multimodal capabilities, powered by its Llama 3.2 models. This means you can now share photos in your chats, not just text, similar to Google Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nWhen sharing a photo, Meta AI can understand what the image contains and answer questions about the image. For example, Meta suggests you could share a photo of a flower and then ask the AI what type of flower it is. Or you could share a photo of a delicious dish and ask Meta AI how to make it. Of course, how accurately Meta AI responds to these and other questions still needs to be tested and reviewed.\nAnother key feature with the added photo support is the ability to edit images using AI.\nAfter sending Meta AI the photo, you can ask it to make some sort of change \u2014 like adding or removing an object in the foreground, changing your outfit, or updating the background of the photo in some way, like adding a rainbow to the sky, for instance.\nMeta AI can also be used on Instagram when you reshare a photo from your feed to your Instagram Stories. Here, the AI technology can look at the photo, understand the images, then generate an accompanying background for your Story.\nBeyond photo edits, Meta is also testing translation tools for Facebook and Instagram Reels that include automatic dubbing and lip-syncing. These tests will initially be run in small groups in the U.S. and Latin America in both English and Spanish.\nOther Meta AI photo features include the expansion of Meta AI's generative AI features and the rollout of tests of Meta AI images shared to your Facebook and Instagram feeds, to prompt users to try the feature.\nFine text during Meta's demo noted the editing features were coming to the U.S. in English first.\nNoted Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg during the event, \"Meta AI differentiates itself in this category by not just offering state-of-the-art AI models, but also unlimited access to those models for free, integrated easily into our different products and apps,\" he said. \"So Meta AI is on track to being the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of this year. In fact, it's probably already there. \u2026 We're almost at 500 million monthly actives, and we haven't even launched in some of the bigger countries yet,\" Zuckerberg added.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/meta-ai-can-now-understand-and-edit-your-photos/\n"

        "Author": "  Ed Ludlow and Kurt Wagner ",
        "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- From the outside, Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s Orion glasses look like a normal pair of spectacles \u2014 if somewhat chunky and tinted. But they are anything but normal.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nA 7,000-Year-Old City Emerges as a Haven from Dubai\u2019s Sky-High Rents\nGang Violence Is Moving to the Amazon\u2019s Fast-Growing Cities\nNew Rowhouses in London That Offer a Bridge to the 19th Century\nClimate Migrants Stand to Overwhelm World\u2019s Megacities\nA Housing Crisis Brews in Rwanda\u2019s Capital City\nThe device, still in development, is the latest attempt to turn the sci-fi concept of augmented-reality glasses into a practical product. When you put them on, you have a clear vision of the world around you, but images and text are overlaid by tiny little projectors using micro LED technology.\nDuring a rare test of the glasses at Meta\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, California, Bloomberg used Orion to display YouTube clips and text messages, make video calls, and generate recipe suggestions by scanning a table of ingredients. The display is controlled by eye movements, and an accompanying wristband turns subtle finger twitches into a \u201cclick\u201d or \u201cscroll\u201d on the screen.\nTasks that you might handle on your phone or laptop today \u201cbecome faster, richer, more convenient,\u201d said Rahul Prasad, a senior product executive inside Meta\u2019s Reality Labs division, which made the glasses.\nOrion won\u2019t be sold to consumers \u2014 at least not in its current form. It\u2019s being \u201cdog-fooded\u201d by Meta employees, meaning they\u2019re testing the product internally before releasing it for public consumption. The hope is to ultimately develop a product priced at the same level as a high-end laptop.\nThe team working on Orion also developed Meta\u2019s latest Ray-Ban spectacles \u2014 smart glasses that have an AI assistant but stop short of true augmented reality. Orion relies on some of the same parts, like speakers and microphones, and the miniaturization of components has helped both devices progress.\nThe reason the Orion glasses are slightly tinted is because the lenses aren\u2019t made of glass at all. They\u2019re silicon carbide, a material known for use in electric vehicles for power conversion and battery systems.\nThe material bends light at very extreme angles, allowing you to have a clear view of the real world \u2014 like normal lenses \u2014 while showing images without rainbow effects or stray light rays. That\u2019s been an issue with other AR headsets. Silicon carbide is also lighter than glass, which helps address another longstanding problem: weight.\nThe frame of the glasses is made of magnesium, which helps make Orion lighter as well. And the metal is conductive and evenly radiates heat. That makes users less conscious of all the electronics packed into the device.\nThe Orion system is actually made up of three hardware pieces: the glasses, a wristband and a wireless computer known as a \u201cpuck.\u201d\nThe glasses have five front-facing cameras that help Orion know where it is. The device relies on a process called simultaneous localization and mapping, or SLAM. The cameras also provide information that feeds the AI functions, and they track a user\u2019s hand movements. To the outside observer, the cameras aren\u2019t too obvious.\nThere are two more cameras on the inside of the frame to track eye movement. Meta has built more than 10 proprietary silicon chips for Orion, which control everything from hand tracking to eye tracking to graphics. They also use less energy to help keep the glasses from overheating.\nThe experience is akin to using your eyeballs as a computer mouse. You simply look at the app or icon you wish to trigger, and it illuminates. You can then \u201cclick\u201d on that app or icon using subtle hand or finger gestures, which are detected by the wristband.\nPinching the thumb to index finger is like clicking the mouse, while pinching the thumb to your middle finger takes you back to Orion\u2019s home page. These hand controls quickly became second nature \u2014 and the experience is one of the more impressive parts of the device.\nThe puck, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t have to be carried around. It just needs to be at a reasonable distance within the room. The puck is like a portable computer that powers all the magic.\nImages are clear and crisp in the wearer\u2019s field of vision, but contained clearly within the parameters of the lenses. The position of various tabs and apps can also be altered, including the depth of where they appear in the room.\nA version of the video game pong can be projected over a table, with two Orion wearers playing opposite each other. The real-world elements are melded into the game in a way that\u2019s not possible with virtual reality goggles. Even Apple Inc.\u2019s Vision Pro, which combines AR and VR, doesn\u2019t let you look directly at the world around you.\nOne potential downside: A person using Orion may still be unaware of how strange they look to an outsider. While using pinches and hand gestures is intuitive, you can become absorbed by the experience and not realize that your arm is dangling out like an awkward T. rex.\nIn a final demo, we were able to scroll through Instagram with the Reels video feed floating there in front of our eyes. A motion akin to flipping a coin with a thumb causes the feed to scroll. The SLAM technology keeps the display in a fixed position relative to the room, unless manually repositioned.\nSo if you turn your head away to the right or left or lean to speak to someone, the Reels feed comes in and out of vision in the glasses. It doesn\u2019t follow your line of sight. That helps keep you a bit more grounded in the real world.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Great \u20ac3 Billion Shipping Container Heist\nInvestors Hot on India Shrug Off Adani Short Seller Attack\nMilitary Veterans Help Plug Worker Shortages at EV, Battery Plants Sprouting Up in the US\nSports Betting Apps Are Even More Toxic Than You Thought\nThe Presidential Election Isn\u2019t Stopping International Students From Coming to America\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.\n"

        "Text": "Investing.com -- Oppenheimer analysts believe Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Vision Pro remains unthreatened by Meta (NASDAQ:META)'s recently showcased AR glasses prototype, Orion.\nDespite Orion's impressive features, including its lightweight design (around 100 grams) and a wide 70-degree field of view (FOV), the analysts suggest it is not yet a competitor to Apple's Vision Pro.\nThe key reason for this, according to Oppenheimer, lies in Orion's cost and market readiness.\n\"Our checks indicate that Orion's bill-of-materials cost easily exceeds $3,000 compared to the Vision Pro's $2,000,\" the firm states.\nA significant portion of this cost is said to come from the silicon carbide (SiC) wafer used in Orion, which is priced at over $350 per pair of glasses.\nOppenheimer explains that this is before considering additional costs for coating and lithography.\nThey add that while Meta's use of SiC contributes to Orion's impressive FOV, it also drives up costs, making the product less commercially viable in the near term.\nMost AR glasses on the market use glass with a high refractive index, which is cheaper but offers a smaller FOV.\n\"Higher refractive index enables higher FOV in AR glasses,\" Oppenheimer explains, noting that Meta's choice of SiC gives Orion a competitive edge in terms of FOV but complicates cost management.\nThe analysts also point out that while Orion's light weight and FOV are impressive, its display resolution and refresh rate lag behind those of Apple's Vision Pro.\nThey assert that \"resolution and speed of display are as important to good user experience as weight and FOV.\"\nOppenheimer concludes that Orion's advanced design is years away from reaching the commercial scalability that Apple's Vision Pro will achieve by 2024, keeping Apple in a strong competitive position.\nRelated Articles\nShould Apple worry about Meta's AR glasses product Orion?\nChina's stimulus-led stock rally pulls Asia and Europe higher; oil falls\nUBS downgrades Siemens Healthineers citing China market challenges\n"

        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nAs of 2024-09-02, Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $679.28. It's currently trading at a price of $521.81. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 23.18%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$19.74\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.91%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 35.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n746.68\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n1199.18\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n679.28\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $647.87. This valuation indicates that the Meta Platforms Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 19.46%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "Catalytic capital enables immediate deployment of CarbonBuilt technology at two production facilities and regional capacity-building\nUltra-low carbon concrete blocks made with CarbonBuilt\u00ae technology en route to a customer\nNEW YORK, Sept. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CarbonBuilt\u00ae today announced a collaboration with Meta to accelerate adoption of its technology and significantly reduce emissions in the hard-to-abate concrete industry. This agreement will enable CarbonBuilt to upgrade additional plants and scale production of its low cost, low-carbon Reversa\u00ae binder more quickly - facilitating rapid adoption and impact.\nCarbonBuilt enables its customers to reduce their carbon footprint by up to 70 percent compared to industry baselines without compromise to price, performance, or plant operations. CarbonBuilt\u2019s low-carbon Reversa binder, which reacts with and permanently stores CO2 during the curing process, displaces carbon-intensive cement in a producer\u2019s ingredient list. Deployed at existing concrete plants, CarbonBuilt\u2019s technology offers a pathway to meaningful decarbonization of the concrete industry, which currently produces about 8 percent of global emissions.\nCarbonBuilt\u2019s solution is commercially available today at Blair Block, Alabama\u2019s largest concrete masonry producer. There, it is producing thousands of tons of concrete each month while delivering both carbon reduction and carbon removal on a daily basis. The company is now focused on rapid expansion, which this collaboration with Meta will accelerate.\n\u201cEveryone agrees that we need more immediate and significant reductions in CO2 emissions if we are to bend the carbon curve,\u201d said Rahul Shendure, CEO of CarbonBuilt. \u201cAll meaningful solutions in the cement and concrete space require some type of infrastructure change, and making them happen fast requires that market participants can secure an attractive return on their investment of financial and human capital. Our collaboration with Meta will help accelerate the scale-up of our ambitious, here-now technology.\u201d\n\u201cMeta is prioritizing a multifaceted approach to accelerating decarbonization in hard-to-abate sectors like concrete. Our collaboration with CarbonBuilt will help them to deliver a step change reduction in emissions with a clear near-term path to scale,\u201d said John DeAngelis, Head of Clean Technology Innovation at Meta. \u201cAccelerating the deployment of these types of solutions is critical for driving deep decarbonization and we hope this collaboration can help pave the path for others to do the same.\u201d\nSince 2020, Meta has maintained net zero emissions in its global operations \u2013 reducing emissions by 94% from a 2017 baseline \u2013 and has publicly committed to achieving net zero emissions across its value chain in 2030. For more information on Meta\u2019s sustainability efforts, visit sustainability.atmeta.com.\nShendure and DeAngelis will discuss this novel partnership on a special \u201cLeadership and Green Growth\u201d panel at The Hub - Live, Tuesday, September 24 from 2-3 p.m. as part of Climate Week NYC.\nABOUT\u00a0CARBONBUILT\u00aeCarbonBuilt, winner of the NRG COSIA Carbon XPRIZE, enables concrete manufacturers to reduce their carbon footprint by up to 70 percent compared to industry baselines. CarbonBuilt\u2019s technology replaces the expensive, high-carbon Portland cement typically used during concrete manufacturing with a proprietary low-cost cement alternative, Reversa\u00ae, made from widely-available low carbon\u00a0materials. These materials harden after chemically reacting with CO2, not only to strengthen the blocks, but also to permanently store the CO2, diverting it from the\u00a0atmosphere. Because it can be cost-effectively installed at existing concrete manufacturing plants and delivers products that meet ASTM C90 and other applicable industry standards without increasing costs, CarbonBuilt\u2019s technology can be rapidly adopted by the nearly 800 concrete masonry plants in the U.S. alone.

        "Author": "  Derek Lewis ",
        "Text": "The 2024 Q2 earnings season is slowly grinding to a halt, with the majority of S&P 500 companies already delivering quarterly results. Looking ahead, Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up +3.8% from the same period last year on +4.6% higher revenues, chaining together consecutive periods of positivity.\nBelow is a chart illustrating earnings expectations for the coming and recent periods.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nSeveral companies have stolen the spotlight throughout the period, including Meta Platforms META, Lockheed Martin LMT, and Eli Lilly LLY. All three posted robust results and upped guidance, with shares of each seeing bullish activity post earnings.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at each.\nMega-cap giant Meta Platforms was one of the few Mag 7 members to see a positive reaction to its quarterly results, with the company again exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations. The company\u2019s earnings outlook reflects bullishness across all timeframes.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe company delivered a stunning statement in the release, with Mark Zuckerberg saying, \u2018We had a strong quarter, and Meta AI is on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year,\" \nHe continued, \"We've released the first frontier-level open source AI model, we continue to see\u00a0good traction with our Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and we're driving good growth across our apps.\" \nMeta also raised its CapEx outlook into a band of $37 - $40 billion ($35 - $40 billion prior) to support its artificial intelligence roadmap.\nThe valuation picture for META remains attractive, with the current 22.4X forward 12-month earnings multiple in line with the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 31.5X. In addition, the current PEG ratio works out to 1.2X, reflecting that investors are paying a fair price for the forecasted growth.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nEli Lilly shares have been red-hot in 2024 thanks to robust results stemming from unrelenting demand, up 65% and widely outperforming relative to the S&P 500. Shares popped following its latest release, with earnings and sales climbing 85% and 35%, respectively.\nThe company upgraded its current-year sales guidance by a sizable $3 billion. Analysts have adjusted their sales expectations accordingly, with the now $46.4 billion expected alluding to a 35% climb year-over-year.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe story behind Eli Lilly has been driven by its diabetes drug Mounjaro and its weight loss injection Zepbound, which have seen unrelenting demand among consumers. Mounjaro sales jumped 216% year-over-year, whereas Zepbound sales of $1.2 billion also reflected strong demand.\nEarnings expectations have shot higher across the board following the release, with LLY sporting a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nLockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, operating in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security, and information technology. The company\u2019s steady growth continued throughout its latest period, with EPS and revenue growing 6% and 9%, respectively.\nThe company has been a long-time favorite among income-focused investors, consistently upping its payout over the years. LMT\u2019s cash-generating abilities have aided its dividend growth, with the company posting nearly $1.3 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest period.\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s dividends paid annually over the last 15 years. Please note that the final value illustrated is on a trailing twelve-month basis.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nFollowing the favorable quarter, LMT upped its EPS, segment profit, and sales guidance, causing shares to move bullishly following the release.\nThe Q2 earnings season overall showed resiliency, with no major spooks hitting the tape. While we saw some mixed reads on the consumer, recent favorable economic data helps alleviate this issue.\nAnd concerning a few companies who stole the spotlight during the reporting period, Meta Platforms META, Lockheed Martin LMT, and Eli Lilly LLY all did precisely that.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "Title": "\u2018From the River to the Sea\u2019 is not hate speech, Meta\u2019s Oversight Board rules",
        "Author": "  Ramishah Maruf, CNN ",
        "Text": "Meta\u2019s Oversight Board has found that the phrase \u201cFrom the River to the Sea,\u201d used to express Palestinian support, did not break the company\u2019s hate speech policies.\nCritics of the phrase, which refers to the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, say that it calls for the abolishment of the Israeli state. The\u00a0Anti-Defamation League accused the slogan of being antisemitic and a \u201crallying cry (that) has long been used by anti-Israel voices, including supporters of terrorist organizations such as Hamas.\u201d\nBut the chant is also frequently used at pro-Palestinian demonstrations by protesters who say it is to call for equal rights and an independent state for Palestinians. It can refer to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza who are restricted in their movements and from visiting Jerusalem.\nThe Board said it reviewed three cases involving the use of \u201cFrom the River to the Sea\u201d on Facebook and said that all appeals to remove the content were closed without human review. Those users then appealed to the Board, which exists for users to challenge Meta\u2019s appeals process on Facebook, Instagram or Threads.\n\u201cSpecifically, the three pieces of content contain contextual signs of solidarity with Palestinians \u2013 but no language calling for violence or exclusion. They also do not glorify or even refer to Hamas, an organization designated as dangerous by Meta,\u201d the decision said. The posts and comments also didn\u2019t contain threats of violence or physical harm.\nThough the majority of the Board agreed the phrase has multiple meanings, the decision noted that a minority believed it glorifies Hamas because it appeared in the group\u2019s 2017 charter.\n\u201cThe phrase\u2019s use by this terrorist group with explicit violent eliminationist intent and actions, does not make the phrase inherently hateful or violent \u2013 considering the variety of people using the phrase in different ways,\u201d the Board said.\nThe Board said the decision underscores tensions in protecting free expression and political speech.\nIn June, a Palestinian-American engineer sued Meta, accusing his former employer of discriminating against pro-Palestinian speech and wrongfully firing him when he investigated those issues.\n\u201cThe employee was dismissed for violating Meta\u2019s data access policies, which we make clear to employees will result in immediate termination,\u201d Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement to CNN at the time.\nThe company said it is expanding on its hate speech policies. In July, Meta said it would remove posts that have the term \u201cZionist\u201d when used in conjunction with antisemitic tropes or dehumanizing rhetoric.\n\u201cThese cases have again underscored the importance of data access to effectively assess Meta\u2019s content moderation during conflicts, as well as the need for a method to track the amount of content attacking people based on a protected characteristic,\u201d the decision said.\nThe chant had been contentious even before the Israel and Hamas war, which has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians after Hamas\u2019 October 7th attack that killed more than 1,200 Israelis and took 250 hostage. For example, in 2018 CNN said it severed ties with a liberal pundit after he called for a \u201cfree Palestine from the river to the sea.\u201d\nBut new attention has been drawn to the chant as protesters call for an end to the war, and the phrase is frequently used at protests ranging from college campuses to large cities. In Germany, using the slogan \u201cFrom the river to the sea\u201d is now a criminal offense. In December, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)\u00a0filed a discrimination complaint on\u00a0behalf of a\u00a0Black\u00a0Muslim\u00a0Arab\u00a0American teacher\u00a0in Maryland after she was placed on administrative leave for her email signature, which contained the slogan. US Congress member Rashida Tlaib was censured for using the phrase.\nThe slogan used in the cases had wide reach through Meta\u2019s platforms. In one case, a likely AI-generated image of floating watermelon slices that formed the slogan was viewed about eight million times and reported by 937 users.\nCNN\u2019s Brian Fung, Alaa Elassar\u00a0and\u00a0Jennifer Henderson contributed to this report. \nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com\n"

        "Title": "BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group and Meta Announce Long-Term Contract for Delivery of 1.3 Million Nature-Based Carbon Removal Credits, With Options for Delivery of Additional 2.6 Million Credits",
        "Author": "Business Wire ",
        "Text": "NEW YORK, September 18, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, the BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group (BTG Pactual TIG) announced a long-term contract with Meta for the delivery of 1.3 million nature-based carbon removal credits, with options for delivery of an additional 2.6 million nature-based carbon removal credits, through 2038 as part of its Latin America reforestation strategy, which is designed to support climate change mitigation alongside benefits for biodiversity and communities.\nThis deal \u2013 one of the largest of its kind \u2013 marks Meta\u2019s first significant engagement in carbon removal in Brazil. The credits will be delivered from BTG Pactual TIG\u2019s $1 billion reforestation and restoration strategy in Latin America, for which Conservation International serves as Impact Adviser to ensure the strategy enhances biodiversity and supports inclusive and equitable community development.\nThe strategy focuses on the conservation, restoration, and planting of deforested and degraded properties in selected regions in Latin America. This includes the Cerrado biome in Brazil, one of the most biodiverse seasonally dry ecosystems in the world. Approximately half of the Cerrado\u2019s land has already been converted to other uses, and the biome continues to face high rates of deforestation. The strategy also focuses on delivering community benefits through increased rural employment, rural community development, and the development of the bioeconomy.\n\"BTG Pactual TIG and Conservation International, in their visionary collaboration, are setting a new bar for how sustainable forestry operations can deliver restoration of degraded land, while providing important economic opportunities for local communities,\" said Blair Swedeen, Global Head of Net Zero and Sustainability at Meta. \"We are proud to support the bold impact strategy that TIG and CI have developed, which aligns with our own goals for our net zero program and for carbon markets broadly.\"\n\"The due diligence, thought leadership and technology that Meta has brought to this transaction has been extraordinary. The team has developed a clear and rigorous approach to carbon removal, and we are extremely pleased to help support their ambition on this front. Meta is among a small group of companies that have pressed forward to develop an approach that will not only underpin the integrity of its own efforts, but support the development of a high-quality carbon market more broadly,\" said Mark Wishnie, Chief Sustainability Officer of BTG Pactual TIG and head of the firm\u2019s reforestation strategy.\n\"With this investment, Meta is sending a message to the rest of the private sector: a sustainable future need not be austere; it can be abundant. We commend Meta for their leadership, including their commitment to improving measurement of forest cover, which is crucial for carbon market integrity,\" said Dr. M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International. \"BTG Pactual TIG continues to prove that forest restoration can be a boon to both the environment and local communities. The success of this initiative is evidence that economic production and environmental protection can be mutually reinforcing, rather than mutually exclusive.\"\nWith Conservation International\u2019s support, BTG Pactual TIG\u2019s strategy aims to protect and restore approximately 135,000 hectares (more than 330,000 acres) of natural forests in deforested landscapes. The strategy also seeks to plant millions of trees in sustainably managed commercial tree farms, independently certified to Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)\u2122 standards, on another approximately 135,000 hectares of previously deforested and degraded land.\nTo date, BTG Pactual TIG has invested in 37,000 hectares, planted more than 7 million seedlings, and initiated restoration of approximately 2,600 hectares of natural forest. More than 300 plant and animal species have been identified on the strategy\u2019s first investment, where a new 400-meter-wide riparian buffer is expected to create a nearly 5-kilometer corridor to a large neighboring natural forest, ultimately connecting nearly 10,000 hectares of natural habitat.\nThe generation of carbon credits forms part of the reforestation strategy\u2019s climate impact, in addition to managing the tree farms on long rotations to store more carbon and produce large diameter logs that can be used for long-lived products. The carbon projects, which have not yet been registered, will seek to meet or exceed leading carbon accounting standards.\nThis transaction represents the execution, in part, of Meta\u2019s carbon removal strategy. Key elements of Meta\u2019s strategy include:\na rigorous assessment of the role of carbon finance in supporting ecosystem restoration together with leading consultancy Carbon Direct;\nthe application of Meta\u2019s AI and advanced computing resources to develop new tools for monitoring terrestrial biomass, including an open source, global map of tree canopy heights launched with World Resources Institute; and\nsupport of the expansion of the voluntary carbon market toward high-quality, nature-based carbon removal projects, including via advance market commitments such as the Symbiosis Coalition.\nMeta is making its forest monitoring technology available to help establish a rigorous baseline of existing forest cover for BTG Pactual TIG\u2019s Latin America reforestation strategy. This includes Meta\u2019s work with World Resources Institute to map tree canopy height at a 1-meter resolution, allowing the detection of single trees at a global scale. All canopy height data and AI models are free and publicly available, including those used for this deal.\nThe transaction is part of Meta\u2019s commitment to reaching net zero emissions across its value chain in 2030, which will largely be achieved by reducing corporate emissions. It will address any residual emissions through carbon removal, including a range of both natural and technological approaches. Forest-based carbon removal and the use of technology to better monitor, report, and verify the carbon sequestration is an essential component of Meta\u2019s carbon removal strategy.\nThe deal also reflects Meta\u2019s commitment to delivering social impact in the carbon removal projects it supports in addition to climate and biodiversity benefits. Beyond creating new local jobs through its investment activities, BTG Pactual TIG is supporting training for local communities for opportunities to generate new income from nature-based activities in the emerging bioeconomy, such as honey production that can be supported, in part, by newly restored forests. In September 2023, BTG Pactual TIG collaborated with the Mato Grosso do Sul Native Seed Network to provide native tree seed collection training for nearby community members. Seed collection can provide new sources of income by supplying a growing restoration market.\nAbout BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group\nBTG Pactual (BPAC11) is the largest investment bank in Latin America, with a market capitalization of approximately US$ 25 billion, offering a diverse range of services, including Investment Banking, Corporate Lending, Sales & Trading, Asset Management, Wealth Management, and Banking.

        "Author": "  Kyle Wiggers ",
        "Text": "Meta's AI assistant, Meta AI, is getting a new voice mode of sorts.\nAt the Meta Connect 2024 developer conference in Menlo Park on Wednesday morning, Meta announced that Meta AI can now respond back to questions out loud across platforms where it's available: Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Facebook. You can choose from several voices, including the AI clones of celebrities that Meta hired for the purpose: Awkwafina, Dame Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key, and Kristen Bell.\nThe new Meta AI voice feature isn't like OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode for ChatGPT, which is highly expressive and can pick up on emotive tones in a person's voice. Rather, it's akin to Google's recently launched Gemini Live, which transcribes speech before having an AI answer it and reading the answer aloud using a synthetic voice.\nMeta's betting the high-profile talent will make a difference; according to The Wall Street Journal, it paid millions for the use of the celebrity likenesses. Color us skeptical, but we'll reserve judgment until we get to try it ourselves.\nIn other Meta AI updates, the assistant can now analyze images thanks to an upgrade to the underlying AI models that power the experience. In regions where it's supported, you can, for example, share a picture of a flower you see and ask Meta AI what kind it is. Or you can upload a photo of a dish and request instructions on how to make it. (Bear in mind you'll occasionally get wrong answers.)\nMeta also says it's piloting a Meta AI translation tool to automatically translate voices in Instagram Reels. The tool dubs a creator's speech and auto-lip-syncs it, simulating the voice in another language and making sure the lip movements match.\nMeta says that it's starting with \"small tests\" of Reels translations on Instagram and Facebook, only with some creators' videos from Latin America in the U.S. in English and Spanish for now.\nThis article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/25/meta-ai-gets-lip-synced-translations-and-celebrity-voices-like-judi-dench-and-john-cena/\n"

Huang has sold shares in tranches of 120,000 each from June 13 to Sept. 5, which accounts for almost 5.3 million shares.\nOn Friday, NVIDIA\u2019s shares posted their worst two-week stretch in two years, while the world\u2019s most sought-after AI player was subjected to wild price swings over the past month that dwarfed even the most volatile assets like cryptocurrency.\nGeopolitical tensions to legal issues plagued NVIDIA, with the stock witnessing a $279 billion wipeout in a single trading session last week. The U.S. Department of Justice subpoenaed NVIDIA in a mounting antitrust issue.\nDoes this sound depressing? Fear not; the NVIDIA stock has an upside potential, and remaining bullish would reap benefits in the long run. Here are the positive reasons \u2013\nInvestors are waiting for the rollout of the cutting-edge new Blackwell chips. However, engineering snags have delayed the process. NVIDIA has been addressing the design flaws in the Blackwell B200 chip and aims to launch it by the year-end. So, the delay period is not long enough to impact the NVIDIA stock\u2019s 2025 results.\nMicrosoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms, Inc. have already ordered Blackwell chips worth billions of dollars, and Amazon.com, Inc. is expected to move from Hopper to Blackwell.\nNVIDIA confirmed that the demand for Blackwell has surpassed supply and may continue into the next fiscal year. After all, the Blackwell platform has more AI throughput than the current Hopper platform. The new Blackwell graphic processing unit (GPU) has greater processing power, which is the most pressing need. It holds 208 billion transistors, way more than the 80 billion in the present H100 CHIP. Also, Blackwell\u2019s NVLink offers high-speed communication, which is the need of the hour.\nThus, strong demand for the Blackwell chip is expected to boost the NVIDIA stock following its launch. Lest we forget, NVIDIA\u2019s shares surged by double digits in the three months following the launch of two previous architectures \u2014 Hopper in the fall of 2022 and Ampere in the spring of 2020.\nIn the dot-com bubble, companies\u2019 shares scaled upward based on hype before the real impact of their business models could be felt. However, AI has become an integral part of all businesses. According to Markets and Markets, the AI industry is poised to expand from $214.6 billion in 2024 to $1,339.1 billion in 2030.\nNVIDIA is well-poised to make the most of the flourishing AI industry since its chips are essential for AI models deployed across several verticals, including cloud computing. This explains why the company\u2019s H100 graphic cards have huge demand in the AI chip market. Moreover, unlike the stocks in the Internet bubble, NVIDIA has solid fundamentals that validate the company\u2019s stretched valuations, and squash bubble fears.\nNVIDIA has generated profits competently since its return on equity (ROE) is almost 120%, which is way higher than the Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s 73.2%. Notably, any ROE above 100% shows that the company\u2019s net income is more than its equity, or the performance is strong.\nNVIDIA\u2019s net profit margin is 55%, above the industry\u2019s 47.6%. Any net margin of 20% indicates the company can curtail costs and generate profits.\nWhat\u2019s more, NVIDIA recently approved a stock buyback worth $50 billion, indicating a healthy corporate organization. Share repurchases decrease the number of outstanding shares and increase the value of the remaining shares, which bodes well for shareholders.\nBeing the worldwide leader in GPUs, NVIDIA\u2019s stock will benefit. Huge data is expected to migrate from central processing units to GPUs, per Huang. According to Precedence Research, the GPU market will expand from $56.55 billion in 2023 to $1,414.39 billion by 2034.\nNVIDIA\u2019s collaboration with Siemens to enter the metaverse space and the introduction of GeForce in the growing gaming market will act as a tailwind for the company. As a result, the $2.80 Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s earnings per share is up 76.1% yearly.\nBanking on the highly anticipated launch of the groundbreaking Blackwell chips, inherent capability to crush bubble concerns, the introduction of stock buyback plans, and a dominant player in the semiconductor space gives NVIDIA\u2019s shares the fuel to scale northward despite the current hiccups.\nProminent brokers, thus, have increased the average short-term price target of NVDA by 40.2% from the stock\u2019s last closing price of $106.47. The analysts\u2019 highest price target is $200, indicating an upside of 87.9%.\nMoreover, the NVIDIA stock has been trading above the 200-day moving average year to date, a tell-tale long-term uptrend. This is why investors should hang on to this multi-bagger stock and not let it go.\nNVIDIA stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Author": "  Zacks Equity Research ",
        "Text": "Chicago, IL \u2013 September 5, 2024 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META.\nHere are highlights from Wednesday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\nThoughMicrosoft has been making significant strides in artificial intelligence (AI), its stock has lagged behind the broader market. With an 8.8% year-to-date (YTD) gain, Microsoft has underperformed both the Zacks Computer & Technology sector and the S&P 500 index's return of 20.7% and 18.4%, respectively. This raises a crucial question of whether Microsoft's AI advancements will provide the needed boost to its stock performance.\nMicrosoft has been at the forefront of the AI revolution, making significant investments in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and integrating AI capabilities across its product suite. This strategic move has positioned Microsoft as a leader in the AI space, potentially opening up new revenue streams and enhancing existing ones. Despite these moves, investors seem to be taking a cautious stance, perhaps waiting for concrete evidence of how these AI initiatives will translate into revenue growth and profitability.\nMicrosoft is rapidly integrating AI across its product lineup, from search engines to cloud computing, leveraging AI to enhance its offerings and challenge competitors in various markets.\nOne of Microsoft's boldest moves is the integration of ChatGPT-like capabilities into Bing, directly challenging Google's search dominance. This initiative, coupled with the expansion of Azure AI, Microsoft's cloud-based AI platform, demonstrates the company's commitment to AI-driven growth. Azure AI has seen remarkable adoption, with its customer base growing nearly 60% year over year to more than 60,000 clients. For fiscal first-quarter 2025, Microsoft projects Intelligent Cloud revenues between $28.6 billion and $28.9 billion, with Azure expected to achieve 28-29% revenue growth at constant currency.\nThe company's productivity suite, Microsoft 365, is also benefiting from AI integration. Features like AI-powered writing assistance in Word and smart data analysis in Excel are enhancing user productivity, potentially leading to higher adoption rates and increased customer retention. These improvements could significantly impact Microsoft's recurring revenue streams.\nMicrosoft's Copilot, an AI-powered productivity tool, is making waves across various sectors. GitHub Copilot, adopted by over 77,000 organizations, including BBVA and FedEx, has seen 180% year-over-year growth, driving GitHub's revenues to a $2 billion annual run rate. The launch of Copilot+ PCs, featuring new system architecture and advanced silicon technology, promises to deliver breakthrough AI experiences and enhanced productivity. Recently, Microsoft expanded the Copilot+ PC portfolio with the introduction of a new silicon technology \u2014 AMD Ryzen AI 300 series and Intel Core Ultra 200V series.\nThe integration of generative AI into Microsoft's Power Platform has enabled over 480,000 organizations to leverage AI capabilities, with monthly active users growing 40% year over year to 48 million. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is rapidly becoming indispensable for knowledge workers, with its daily users nearly doubling quarter over quarter.\nAs Microsoft continues to invest heavily in AI, the challenge lies in translating these technological advancements into tangible financial results. Success will be measured by increased market share in search, accelerated growth in cloud services and improved adoption rates for productivity tools. Investors and industry watchers will be closely monitoring Microsoft's ability to leverage its AI capabilities into market-beating performance as the AI landscape evolves.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MSFT's fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $277.39 billion, indicating 13.2% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings per share is pegged at $13.04, indicating 10.5% growth year over year.\nMicrosoft's recent stock underperformance, despite its AI initiatives, highlights the complex factors influencing tech sector valuations. While the company pushes forward with AI integration across its product line, broader market concerns and macroeconomic uncertainties continue to impact investor sentiment.\nThe AI landscape is becoming increasingly competitive, with tech giants like Alphabet-owned Google, Amazon and Meta Platforms making significant investments. Microsoft's success will hinge on its ability to maintain a competitive edge and effectively monetize its AI technologies. Additionally, looming regulatory scrutiny adds an element of uncertainty to AI-driven growth prospects across the industry.\nMicrosoft's current valuation presents a premium scenario, with its forward 12-month P/S ratio of 10.71X exceeding both the Zacks Computer - Software industry average of 7.98X and its own historical median of 10.1X. This elevated pricing reflects strong investor confidence in Microsoft's future growth, particularly in cloud computing and AI. However, it also raises questions about potential limitations and whether the company's performance can justify this premium in the long term.\nAs Microsoft navigates these challenges, investors will be closely watching its ability to translate AI innovations into tangible financial results and market outperformance.\nWhile Microsoft's 8.8% YTD gain appears modest compared to the broader market and industry performance, the company's aggressive moves in AI present a potential catalyst for future growth. The successful integration and monetization of AI across its product lines could open up new revenue streams, enhance Microsoft's competitive position and drive the stock further.\nHowever, investors should also be mindful of the challenges, including intense competition and potential regulatory hurdles. Maintaining a position in this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock appears prudent at present. New investors should, however, wait for a better entry point for Microsoft.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "Title": "Navigating Market Uncertainty: Intrinsic Value of Meta Platforms Inc",
        "Author": "  GuruFocus Research ",
        "Text": "In this article, we will take a look into Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow.\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\nAs of 2024-09-16, Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $679.28. It's currently trading at a price of $524.62. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is 22.77%. The company is modestly undervalued.\nThe GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Meta Platforms Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps.\nTerm\nValue\nExplanation\nEPS without NRI\n$19.74\nGuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow.\nDiscount Rate\n10%\nAn appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 3.65%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 4%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate.\nGrowth Stage\nGrowth rate (g1) = 35.70% Years of Growth Stage = 10\nWe choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years.\nTerminal Stage\nGrowth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10\nFor the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation.\nGrowth Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n[ (1 + g1) / (1 + d)\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n746.68\nTerminal Stage\n=\nEPS without NRI\n*\n(1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10\n*\n[ (1 + g2) / (1 + d)\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2\n+\n...\n+\n(1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ]\n=\n1199.18\nIntrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based)\n=\nGrowth Stage\n+\nTerminal Stage\n=\n679.28\nGuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $647.87. This valuation indicates that the Meta Platforms Inc is modestly undervalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of 19.02%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page.\nPlease note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model:\nFuture Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings.\nEmbracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value.\nPredictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized.\nDiscount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate.\nUsing the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "Text": "A new ETF is aiming to differentiate in an increasingly cluttered industry with a strategy that relies on artificial intelligence to replicate the investment practices\u2014and hopefully successes\u2014of financial greats like Warren Buffett and David Tepper.\nIntelligent Alpha, a Minneapolis-based investment management affiliate of Deepwater Asset Management, has launched its first ETF, the Intelligent Livermore ETF (LIVR). The fund gained 2.5% Wednesday afternoon, its first day of trading.\nLIVR is developing investment strategies by using three large-language AI models, including ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini, collectively representing the \u201cinvestment committee.\u201d It's top holdings include Meta Platforms Inc., Nvidia Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.\nDoug Clinton, Intelligent Alpha\u2019s founder and chief executive, said the idea for LIVR was developed over the past year when he started experimenting with various AI platforms to replicate investments strategies.\nThe objective of the strategy is to AI to replicate the personalities and philosophies of some of the world\u2019s most renowned investors, including Warren Buffett and David Tepper.\nLIVR Top 5 Holdings\nSource: Intelligent Alpha\nClinton said the strategy relies on writings, public statements and public filings to construct the respective investment philosophies \u201cto show how they might think right now.\u201d\n\u201cThen we feed it a data set of stocks, and have it analyzed with the philosophy and mindset of those investors,\u201d he explained.\nLIVR, which has an expense ratio of 69 basis points, is not the only ETF leveraging AI in the pursuit of investment alpha, but Clinton said Intelligent Alpha is the only investment firm \u201cbuilt entirely from the ground up to use large-language models that are able to speak and communicate on a wide range of general topics just like a human.\u201d\nWhile LIVR is the first, Clinton said there are four other AI-powered ETFs already filed and slated for launches over the next three-to-six months.\nThose strategies include a technology-focused ETF, a small-cap, large-cap and an ETF named Omaha, which is the value-investing tribute to Buffett.\nAnd, while this is the first ETF from Intelligent Alpha, Clinton said he has some experience in how the ETF space works through a licensing agreement for the Deepwater Frontier Tech Index, which is tracked by the Innovator Loup Frontier Tech ETF (LOUP).\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.
